Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI (14) is 43.25, still below 50, while MACD is still below zero, showing momentum is improving slowly, but buyers are not strong yet. Support is around $0.2042 and $0.200. Resistance is around $0.2056, then $0.206–$0.207, then $0.215 and $0.22. As of January 2, 2026, Pi Network is trading sideways today, with price holding in a tight range just above the $0.20 level as buyers and sellers stay evenly matched. Pi is holding near $0.205, with a market cap around $1.71B and 24-hour volume near $7.96M, which is still light and shows limited conviction. The market looks calm, with Pi stabilizing rather than starting a clear upward move. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows small-bodied candles, showing consolidation rather than a strong move in either direction. Price is basically just above the mid-$0.2052 area with no clear follow-through from buyers or sellers. The RSI (14) is 43.25, with its signal line near 40.96, which keeps momentum below the neutral 50 mark and suggests buyers are still cautious. Selling pressure isn’t aggressive, but RSI needs to push back toward the high-40s/50 area to show stronger demand. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the histogram is +0.0010, while the MACD line is −0.0042 and the signal line is −0.0052. Both lines being below zero means the broader trend is still bearish, but the positive histogram shows the downside pressure is easing and the market is trying to stabilize. Support is around $0.204 and then $0.200, while resistance is near $0.206 and $0.210. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading around $0.2051 and is slightly higher on the session, with the latest candle showing O $0.2049, H $0.2053, L $0.2048, C $0.2051. Price action is still tight, but it’s slowly grinding upward from the late-December dip, with candles holding above the mid-$0.20 area instead of slipping back under it. The RSI (14) is 59.42, with its signal line near 53.00, which keeps momentum above 50 and shows buyers have more control than earlier in the week. It’s not an aggressive rally, but it does suggest the market is leaning slightly positive on this timeframe. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the values are MACD 0.0002, signal 0.0000, and histogram 0.0002. Because these readings are at or just above the zero line, it means bearish pressure has faded, and momentum is mildly positive, but the numbers are small, so the move is still weak and could stay range-bound. Support is around $0.204 and $0.202, while resistance is near $0.206 and $0.208. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2707 SELL SMA 5 $0.2354 SELL SMA 10 $0.2207 SELL SMA 21 $0.2157 SELL SMA 50 $0.2278 SELL SMA 100 $0.2377 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2112 SELL EMA 5 $0.2185 SELL EMA 10 $0.2396 SELL EMA 21 $0.2782 SELL EMA 50 $0.3429 SELL EMA 100 $0.4387 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? If Pi keeps holding the $0.20 support, the most likely move is more sideways trading with small bounces toward the $0.206–$0.21 resistance area. If it drops and closes clearly below $0.20, the downside risk increases, and the price could slide toward the next lower zone before buyers step back in. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is slightly up because supply pressure is easing: today’s large unlock is among the last big daily releases before unlocks drop, and some PI has moved off exchanges, reducing immediate sell pressure in a thin market. On the chart, a mild technical rebound (MACD turning up and RSI still not overbought) is helping, but unclear roadmap sentiment is still limiting a stronger move. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value. Recent Pi News/Opinions Pi Network’s Core Team published a 2025 recap highlighting milestones such as February’s Open Network launch, AI integrations, and ongoing KYC progress. As 2025 comes to a close, Pi remains focused on steady progress, responsible building, and long-term utility creation.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates.

As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

BTC is trading at $89,606, increasing by over 2% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 52, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buying domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $90,689, it will fuel a bullish rally to $94,661. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $86,356, beginning a bearish trend to $83,468. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying pressure as sellers failed to push the price below immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2028, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November. Bitcoin ended December 2025 on a bearish note by trading below $90K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Echoing the views of several other prominent voices in finance – notably of Robert Kiyosaki – McGlone opined on January 1 that 2026 will be a year of volatility and crisis but also one of opportunity for the ‘tactically orientated’ to make a fortune. Base Case Update 2026 – Dope-Sniffing Dogs May Prevail: – Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000 – President Trump faces similarly poor timing as Herbert Hoover – A third down year for US stocks since 2008 – Cryptos to lead the next… — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) January 1, 2026 Will the Great Depression 2.0 start in 2026? Though measured in tone, the Commodity Strategist hinted he expects 2026 to be a crisis year by providing a historical parallel. Specifically, he opined that President Donald Trump shall suffer from poor timing, much like President Herbert Hoover. Hoover famously entered the Oval Office in 1929, mere months before the Great Depression started. McGlone provided both evidence for his assumptions and issued several stark predictions. Specifically, he identified gold’s grabbing of alpha – its ability to outperform the market – as a major warning sign evident through much of 2025. Gold grabbing alpha in 2025 was a warning – especially vs. falling crude oil Unfortunately for investors hoping to benefit from the precious metals boom, the market expert also opined that gold, silver , and most similar assets will suffer from, in his words, ‘went up-too-much’ dangers in 2026. Similarly, McGlone identified T-Bonds – the debt securities of the American government – as the stars of the market, as he estimates they will be the ones to ‘take alpha’ from the yellow metal in the ongoing year. Will the crypto market bloom in 2026? Mike McGlone simultaneously gave a word of warning to cryptocurrency investors as he forecasted that a Bitcoin ( BTC ) fall to $50,000 is more likely than a rally back to $100,000. As evidence, he cited that Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the digital assets market – dropped 19% last year. Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000. Cryptos to lead the next post-inflation deflation cycle due to wealth creation reversion. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index dropped 19% in 2025. External evidence that the cryptocurrency bull market can be found in the fact that the 4-year BTC cycle pattern has been broken. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to enjoy three green years followed by a major correction. BTC 12-month price chart.

However, while the pressure is clearly visible, artificial intelligence ( AI ) models suggest that the cryptocurrency may somewhat stabilize this month and maybe see some gains. Some early signs of this stabilization may already be evident, with Bitcoin trading at around $89,500 at the time of writing, up nearly 2% on the day due to a supportive technical picture. Bitcoin price reclaims key technical levels A few of the core momentum measures have also strengthened, led by the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 70.4, signaling firm upside momentum. The MACD value of 319.5 likewise remains positive. Trend strength readings further reinforced the picture. For instance, the Average Directional Index ( ADX ) rose to 65.2, a level typically associated with bullish directional moves. Similarly, a positive Rate of Change ( ROC ) at 1.308 indicates that bulls are firmly in control of order flow. However, it must be noted that the white/red Stochastic Oscillator, which measures price momentum over the past nine periods smoothed across six periods, is at 99.2, suggesting a consolidation period or a pullback toward short-term moving averages is possible. AI Bitcoin price prediction for January 2026 With the technical picture hinting at potential short-term upticks, Finbold used its AI-driven price prediction tool to see where BTC could sit by the end of the month. To generate its forecast, the model aggregates results from ChatGPT , Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4, pointing to a range of potential outcomes. Finbold AI BTC price forecast. Source: Finbold The average Bitcoin price target for the end of January came out at $91,900, implying a 2.67% upside from current levels. Claude Sonnet 4 gave the most bullish figure, projecting a potential 6.97% rally, while Gemini 2.5 Flash actually suggested the price could go down 0.07% downside. ChatGPT was bullish but conservative, arguing for a 1.1% gain. Finbold AI BTC technical analysis. Source: Finbold Overall, Bitcoin’s potential this month primarily reflects its technical resilience, although it can be added that $12 million in altcoin-driven liquidity inflows could also have played a role. In other words, short-term momentum currently favors buyers, who are closely watching whether Bitcoin can defend support around $88,319, the 61.8% Fibonacci level .

According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, a bearish market sentiment has taken hold over the past few months, with some market watchers claiming the top of the four-year market cycle has already passed. The crypto market analytics platform believes investor sentiment has changed due to Bitcoin’s muted end-of-year performance, but the lines between traditional financial assets and crypto are also blurred, as companies experiment with new forms of tokenization. Delphi market analysis: Equity is moving onchain Per Delphi’s 2026 outlook , the distinction between tokens and traditional equity is now more difficult to define since companies like California-based Securitize are filing for initial public offerings (IPOs) while simultaneously looking into tokenization. Crypto is facing a token identity crisis. The lines are blurring on both sides. Equity is moving onchain with companies like Securitize filing for IPOs. Tokens are becoming more equity like through MetaDAO's ownership coins and Uniswap's fee switch. Customer Acquisition Cost… pic.twitter.com/CgjHQuHq8q — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) January 1, 2026 Some crypto projects, such as MetaDAO have launched ownership tokens that mimic how traditional financial firms issue shares, and decentralized platform Uniswap has added fee switches, much like how equity-like returns are for token holders. Among the upcoming token models is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tokens, which are distinct to equity-like tokens or governance mechanisms because they fund user acquisition at scale. PayPal is one of the many companies moving forward with tokenization, having spent over $60 million in venture capital cash on incentives to begin its quest for digital assets. Yet, per Delphi, CAC tokens could achieve comparable results through token emissions, where early adopters can receive larger rewards that taper as the network grows. The analysts cited Worldcoin as the best example of this model, reportedly spreading over 500 million WLD tokens to onboard users and expanding the footprint of its World App. According to data from Dune analytics, the project crossed $3.8 billion market cap level during the bull market run in mid-2025, although its token’s price traded below $2.5 in the whole of last year. US regulatory clarity opens crypto market to institutions Changes in regulations have made things much clearer for the crypto industry, especially in the US and Europe. POTUS signed an executive order in the US to encourage responsible innovation and the use of stablecoins backed by the dollar. However, he also clearly said that a CBDC was not an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went a step ahead to support experimentation by issuing no-action letters for the Depository Trust Company’s tokenization pilot and the Fuse Crypto Token. US Congress is in support of crypto-friendly candidates for 2026 midterms. This comes against the backdrop of discussing the CLARITY Act , which places crypto regulatory oversight in the hands of the CFTC. Although some economists believe there are still some hiccups in country-by-country jurisdictional rules, MiCA has been protecting investors and has made the environment more palatable for institutions to join in. Crypto market mulls optimism as Bitcoin trades just below $90,000 Despite the ongoing gloomy outlook, there is a perception that the industry has grown enough to handle downturns and escape historic crypto winters. “It’s more of an industry now. So if there is a winter or a downturn, it’s not going to be a complete lights-out moment,” Kaiko senior researcher Adam Morgan McCarthy told NPR. The crypto derivatives market has approximately $2.2 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options reaching expiration, with the former taking up $1.87 billion in notional value currently outstanding. At the time of this reporting, the king coin is trading at around $88,970, just above the $88,000 “max pain” point, where option writers may start counting heavy losses. Coinglass open interest data shows 14,194 call contracts have been placed against 6,806 puts, which could mean hodlers are bracing for a price comeback upwards of $90,000.

Price action is compressing, RSI is turning higher, and institutional buyers continue to accumulate, yet prediction markets remain skeptical of a rapid six-figure breakout. Polymarket odds still favor $120,000 as the most likely outcome, even as Bitcoin trades within a tightening triangle near $89,000. The next move could set the tone for the year ahead. Polymarket: Why Traders Are Hesitant to Predict a Quick $150K Bitcoin Price Surge Bitcoin is kickstarting 2026 with a mixed bag of optimism and realism. While analysts are still tossing around six-figure targets, Polymarket traders are still being cautious about how high they think BTC can go before 2027. Looking at the market odds, you see that the most likely outcome is $120,000, with a 45% probability, even though that level is below its 2025 all-time high. But the confidence in higher targets is starting to wane. Polymarket is saying: 35% of traders think $130,000 is a possibility 28% of traders think $140,000 is a possibility 21% of traders think $150,000 is a possibility Source: Polymarket By contrast, the market is saying there’s probably an 80% chance Bitcoin either holds or recovers the $100,000 zone, suggesting traders think it will hold firm but don’t expect a rags-to-riches surge right away. This caution might be due to cycle dynamics – Bitcoin ended last year in the red, and with the 4-year halving cycle coming to a close, traders are probably being a bit more picky about where they put their bets. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Signals Long-Term Commitment On the other hand, despite softer sentiment among individual traders, the institutions are still putting their money where their mouth is. In the last quarter of 2025, Japan-based Metaplanet added 4,279 BTC, bringing its stash to 35,102 BTC, which is worth a cool $3.1 billion at today’s prices. Even though their stock price has been a bit of a dud, they’re still treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Tether has done the same thing. As BTC dipped below $88,000, the stablecoin issuer added 8,889 BTC, which cost them about $778.7 million. These purchases don’t guarantee a quick price spike, but they do show that the big players are using the dips to get a bit more exposure. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Triangle Breakout Or Triangle Breakdown? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction continues to be neutral, as BTC is trading around $89,400, stuck inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. This pattern is more about tightening volatility than any weakness. The price is still forming higher lows, and the resistance line is sloping down from $92,800 to $93,000. BTC is oscillating around a pivot zone near $88,200-$89,000, where the 50-day and 100-day EMA100-day EMAs are converging. This compression of the EMAs is a sign of balance, not a sign that things are approaching a breaking point. As long as the price stays above the rising trendline from $84,400 and the 200-day EMA near $87,000, the overall structure remains constructive. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The candlestick action is backing that up as well. Recent sessions are showing spinning tops and small-bodied candles, which are more a sign of indecision than of selling off. The RSI has broken its short-term downtrend and is now above 55, suggesting momentum is strengthening. If Bitcoin can close above $90,500, that would resolve the triangle to the upside and open a path towards $92,800 and then $95,000. If it breaks below $87,000, though, that would be a blow to the setup and open the possibility of a move down to $85,800; at the moment, the structure is more likely to be on the upside. What Could Trigger Bitcoin’s Next Major Move in 2026 With institutions soaking up supply and price compressing to a technical apex, the setup suggests preparation is underway, not exhaustion. Whether the next move is a measured breakout or just another range expansion will define how quickly those $150,000 targets start looking realistic. For now, traders are betting on patience, and history suggests Bitcoin tends to reward it. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

While there has been no significant bullish breakout yet, the price is pressing against key local resistances. Buyers are trying to reclaim control, but the lack of follow-through makes this a pivotal area to watch. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC remains trapped within a descending channel, testing the upper boundary once again near the critical $90K level. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages located above $95K act as major dynamic resistance levels, and buyers have yet to reclaim them. Despite recent bounce attempts, momentum has been fading. RSI is climbing but is still around the neutral territory, indicating that there is room for a move higher. If buyers fail to break above the $90K zone and the higher boundary of the channel, another visit to the $80K support zone remains likely. Until that breakout happens, this is still a bearish market structure. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the asset has been consolidating in a short-term channel. Multiple rejections from the $90K level, located at the middle of the channel, have formed a mid-range ceiling. Meanwhile, higher lows forming gradually below this zone show that buyers are slowly stepping in. The RSI is also pushing higher, showing bullish momentum building while still not being overbought. If a clean breakout above $90K occurs with strength, it opens up the way for a move toward the primary resistance zone at $95K. On the other hand, failure at the $90K zone could mean another sweep back toward $86K and even a breakdown of the channel that could pave the way for a deeper drop toward the $80K area. On-Chain Analysis The BTC exchange reserve metric continues to drop sharply, hitting 2.75M BTC, a significant multi-year low. This trend reflects ongoing accumulation and reduced sell pressure on centralized exchanges. While the price action has remained stagnant, this underlying metric supports the long-term bullish thesis. However, the disconnect between low reserves and weak price action highlights the broader uncertainty and hesitation among market participants heading into the first quarter of 2026. Therefore, more sideways or even corrections might be required before the market can begin rallying again.

As per the current market, “What price will Bitcoin hit before 2027?” Polymarket shows 45% odds of Bitcoin reaching $120,000. Notably, this price point is below its all-time high. The probabilities drop sharply at higher price levels, with $130,000 carrying a 35% chance, $140,000 falling to 28%, and $150,000 priced at just 21%. Reports indicate that traders are placing a safe bet, with an 80% likelihood that BTC will reach a peak of $100,000 . With this move in place, sources claimed that it was unclear why users opt to be very cautious. Some assumed that they decided to adopt this approach in relation to the end of the four-year cycle , following Bitcoin’s major losses in 2025. Uncertainties surrounding the fate of Bitcoin spark controversy Regarding the four-year cycle, it is worth noting that the cycle followed trends around halving events in the history of BTC. It also played a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by helping traders forecast future movements. Now that the cycle is losing prominence, analysts suggest that a new trading pattern may be emerging. Interestingly, despite the crypto market being pessimistic, experts still propose that 2026 will be a strong year for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump made it clear that he intends to announce the US Federal Reserve’s new chair in the upcoming weeks. This news sparked hope in the cryptocurrency industry, as many had anticipated that interest rates would decrease. Immediately after those assumptions, the prices of precious metals, such as gold and silver, increased significantly, with both reaching new peaks in the last quarter of 2025. Digital assets, on the other hand, remained unchanged. Analysts are now expressing the likelihood of crucial crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, to provide straightforward regulations and potentially facilitate significant institutional adoption. Several analysts from firms such as Standard Chartered, Strategy, and Bernstein forecast that the price of BTC may reach an all-time high of $150,000 by 2026. Others, like Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who adopted a more positive outlook on the matter, suggested that the cryptocurrency could rise as much as $200,000 to $250,000. Traders point out some of the limitations surrounding BTC’s growth Bitcoin’s price ignited tension in the crypto industry after dropping sharply in November. Analysts claim that some factors could not sustain the cryptocurrency’s price above the $110,000 level. These factors were institutional investments and corporate purchases. They provided various reasons to back this claim. Among these reasons, one key factor raised is the surging interest in Bitcoin options, particularly those related to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. In the meantime, it was confirmed that the total open interest in Bitcoin options escalated from a record of $39 billion noted in December 2024 to a new level in December 2025. Analysts explained that this rise led to heightened awareness of the covered call strategy in the ecosystem. Critics, on the other hand, expressed their belief that by leasing out their anticipated earnings for a fee, major investors have unintentionally set a restriction that halts Bitcoin from attaining its next substantial growth phase. To better understand this point, analysts noted that it is useful to perceive a covered call as an option between earning a higher price and receiving a regular income. Don’t just read crypto news.

This development follows the year-end holiday period when traditional markets closed while cryptocurrency spot trading continued globally. Market analysts now scrutinize this price discrepancy as a potential catalyst for increased volatility during early 2026 trading sessions. Understanding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap represents a measurable price difference between the December 31, 2025 closing price and the January 2, 2026 opening price. Importantly, this gap formed because Bitcoin’s spot market continued trading during the CME’s holiday closure from December 31 through January 1. Consequently, when futures trading resumed, the contract prices adjusted to reflect spot market movements that occurred during the exchange’s inactivity. Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized market analyst, first identified this development through social media platform X. The analyst noted that such gaps typically become focal points for short-term trading strategies. Furthermore, historical data shows that approximately 85% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies significantly based on market conditions. The Mechanics of Futures Market Dislocations CME Bitcoin futures operate on a regulated schedule that differs from cryptocurrency spot markets. While spot exchanges like Coinbase and Binance operate 24/7 throughout the year, traditional derivatives markets observe specific holidays and weekends. This structural difference creates periodic disconnections between derivative and spot prices. Recent Notable CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps Date Gap Size Fill Time Market Context January 2024 $420 3 days Post-ETF approval rally July 2024 $580 14 days Regulatory uncertainty period January 2025 $510 7 days Institutional adoption phase January 2026 $655 TBD Current analysis period Market Implications and Historical Precedents The current $655 gap represents one of the larger January openings in CME Bitcoin futures history. Market participants generally monitor these gaps because they often create technical trading opportunities. Specifically, traders might position themselves to profit from the expected price movement toward the gap fill level. However, the timing remains uncertain and depends on multiple market factors. Historical analysis reveals several important patterns: January gaps tend to fill faster than mid-year gaps, averaging 5.3 days versus 11.7 days Larger gaps (over $500) typically indicate stronger market momentum during the closure period Institutional participation in gap fills has increased steadily since 2023 Volatility spikes often accompany the gap-filling process, particularly during Asian trading hours Expert Perspectives on the 2026 Market Opening Financial analysts emphasize that CME gaps provide valuable information about market sentiment during exchange closures. The $655 discrepancy suggests significant spot market activity occurred while institutional traders couldn’t adjust their futures positions. This situation potentially indicates several market dynamics, including retail-driven movements, geopolitical developments, or algorithmic trading patterns that continued during the holiday period. According to derivatives market specialists, CME Bitcoin futures now represent approximately 35% of all regulated Bitcoin derivatives volume globally. This substantial market share means gaps in CME contracts often influence broader market psychology, even affecting spot prices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The current gap’s size suggests particularly strong momentum developed during the two-day trading hiatus. Technical Analysis and Trading Considerations Traders typically approach CME gaps using specific technical methodologies. The gap area itself often functions as both support and resistance, depending on the gap’s direction. For the current $655 gap, analysts will monitor whether prices move toward filling the gap quickly or if the market establishes new trading ranges above or below the gap zone. Several factors could influence how this situation develops: Volume analysis during the first week of January trading Institutional flows through regulated investment products Global macroeconomic developments affecting risk assets Cryptocurrency-specific news regarding regulation or adoption Market technicians note that gap fills don’t always occur immediately. Sometimes markets establish new trends that leave gaps unfilled for extended periods. However, statistical analysis shows that CME Bitcoin futures gaps under $700 have a 92% fill rate within 30 trading days, based on data from 2020 through 2025. The Regulatory and Institutional Context The CME’s position as a regulated exchange adds significance to these market events. Unlike cryptocurrency-native derivatives platforms, CME operates under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight with traditional market hours and holiday schedules. This regulatory framework attracts institutional participants who may interpret gaps differently than cryptocurrency-native traders. Since the 2023 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the relationship between CME futures and spot markets has strengthened considerably. Many institutional trading desks now use CME futures for hedging ETF exposures, creating additional connections between these market segments. The January 2026 gap therefore reflects not just holiday trading patterns but also evolving institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Global Market Reactions and Comparative Analysis While the CME observed its holiday schedule, other global derivatives markets showed varied responses. European exchanges with different holiday calendars displayed smaller gaps, while Asian markets demonstrated continuous trading throughout the period. This geographic variation in market structure creates arbitrage opportunities that sophisticated traders often exploit during such dislocations. The $655 gap size exceeds most comparable periods in recent years. For context, the average January CME Bitcoin futures gap from 2021-2025 measured $387, making the current development approximately 69% larger than the recent average. This substantial difference suggests unusual market conditions developed during the year-end transition period. Risk Management Perspectives Professional traders emphasize that gap trading carries specific risks. While historical patterns provide guidance, each market situation involves unique variables. Risk managers typically recommend position sizing that accounts for the possibility that gaps may not fill as expected or may take longer than anticipated to resolve. Additionally, the increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and traditional markets adds complexity to gap analysis. During the 2025 holiday period, traditional equity and bond markets also experienced unusual movements that might have influenced cryptocurrency sentiment indirectly through portfolio rebalancing or risk appetite adjustments. Conclusion The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap forming on the first trading day of 2026 represents a significant market development with implications for short-term volatility and trading strategies. This event highlights the ongoing structural differences between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency trading ecosystems. As institutional participation in cryptocurrency derivatives grows, understanding these market mechanics becomes increasingly important for all market participants. The coming weeks will reveal whether this gap fills quickly or establishes new trading parameters for early 2026. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a CME Bitcoin futures gap? A CME Bitcoin futures gap occurs when there’s a price difference between the closing price before a market holiday and the opening price after the holiday. This happens because Bitcoin’s spot market trades continuously while CME futures have specific trading hours and holidays. Q2: How often do these gaps typically get filled? Historical data from 2020-2025 shows approximately 85-92% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies from immediate to several weeks depending on market conditions and gap size. Q3: Why does the CME have different trading hours than spot cryptocurrency exchanges? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange operates as a traditional regulated financial exchange with set hours and holidays, while cryptocurrency spot markets operate 24/7 globally without traditional market closures. Q4: How does this $655 gap compare to previous years? The $655 gap exceeds the average January gap of $387 from 2021-2025 by approximately 69%, making it one of the larger January openings in recent CME Bitcoin futures history. Q5: What should traders watch regarding this development? Traders typically monitor trading volume, institutional flows, and whether prices begin moving toward the gap level. The speed and manner of any potential gap fill can provide insights into market sentiment and momentum for early 2026.

Index fund flows and passive investing have fundamentally altered market dynamics, making stock-picking more challenging and indexation effects unavoidable. Portfolio allocation size matters more than simple buy/hold/sell labels; conviction and volatility should drive position sizing. Sector movements are increasingly dictated by ETF flows, causing good companies to underperform as index dominance overshadows fundamentals. “Mediocre.” I guess there are many worse things we can be called. I've been called plenty of those in the comments section here, as I approach 2,500 of those answered in 3 years. Quite a journey so far. Thanks to all who have taken the time to read my work during 2025. Mediocre is also how I describe how Bitcoin has performed historically. Does that sound strange, given its monster move earlier this year to an all-time high? Or, due to its even bigger run-up since before most of us knew what cryptocurrency was (or when “staking” was a misspelled way to say, “I'm making steak for dinner”)? Here's what I'm getting at. This is Bitcoin's price since mid-November of 2021. So more than 4 years ago. That's when it touched $60,000. Since that time, it has doubled, and then some, topping out at $126,000 on October 6 of 2025. And now, around $88,000 near year-end 2025, off 30% from that peak, it is up only 34% from where it was more than 49 months ago. So about an 8% annualized return. Data by YCharts The bad news: that's a lot more risk to take on when, as we see below, T-bills earned half that return, despite starting near a 0% rate in late 2021. And the much-maligned non-US segment of the stock market, represented above by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF ( EFA ), had a nice year in 2025, but that followed 3 years of zilch. Yet based only on the strength of a solid past 12 months, EFA's return since that November 2021 starting point now exceeds that of Bitcoin. As we see above, EFA (orange line) and Bitcoin (purple line) took very different directions but ended up at about the same spot. What does this say about Bitcoin's future as an investment? NOTHING. What does it say about perception versus reality when it comes to popular asset types? A LOT. This is why I recently published this table as part of a detailed article on how I'm using 10 ETFs as the current “core” of my Allocation portfolio that I run for investing group members and also share with subscribers at my website. The goal is to coach investors based on my experience allocating through modern market conditions, with risk management at the forefront of everything. ETF Yourself Using Bitcoin to lower risk? You might be surprised to hear “Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT )” and “risk management at the forefront” in the same place. That's the whole idea. To combine asset classes that often exhibit LOW CORRELATION to each other, particularly when markets tank. Look, I get it. Crypto-millionaires and even billionaires are out there. I live close enough to Miami, where many of them now reside, to realize that. But with all investments, there are the early adopters. And while some hit it big, time after time, for many it is more like a strategic “lottery ticket.” The way venture capitalists reportedly fail 90% of the time . But if that one out of 10 takes off, the other 9 are quickly forgotten. Among my other pursuits, I own a partial interest in some racehorses. It's the steadiest part of the game (“claiming”), but it is still a sport in which one win pays for a string of 5th- and 6th-place finishes. The focus here is on the iShares Bitcoin ETF, the largest of its kind. And its relationship to the S&P 500, past and potentially in the future. Because recently, the biggest, most exciting trades of the last few years have started to roll over. But as I recall as a past dog owner, they can flip themselves right back up in a nanosecond. So that's always a possibility. When markets are driven as they are now by algorithms and index fund flows, and nearly every market segment picks a side (are you a risk-on asset or a risk-off asset?), this is something we'll all need to live with as investors. Market indecision is much more common these days. And it leads me to the key factor of position-sizing. Position-sizing: a quick introduction My entire investing process is about this: “Buy/Hold/Sell” are very misleading ways to characterize any investment at any point in time. It says everything about WHAT you are owning or not, but not a thing about HOW MUCH AS A PERCENT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO you are allocating to it. If I have a buy rating on 2 stocks, 1 might be 1% of my portfolio (more volatile, less committed to it, just dipping my toe in for starters). And the other is 5% of my portfolio. That might be because it is much less volatile, and I need to own more to get the dollar return I seek. Or, I might just believe it is an ideal situation (chart-wise, which is my main approach). Now to that IBIT situation and why I have it as a semi-regular spot among 10 ETFs in that allocation portfolio. I've smoothed this out to 3-month rolling returns, with 1-month moving windows. And while IBIT is just reaching 2 years old, the thing with Bitcoin is this: it acts differently with so much ETF money having plowed in. The same can be said for the S&P 500. Data by YCharts Yet in that picture above, I see a pair of ETFs that sometimes rise and fall together but are different in terms of volatility and the potential to move independently of each other. I can't say that about a lot of equity ETFs compared to SPY and about a lot of crypto ETFs compared to IBIT. So for now, they exhibit enough for me to allocate to each, just in varying allocations. Based on their relative attractiveness. These are the basics of diversification. But it is SO MUCH TOUGHER to find nowadays. Thanks to the forces that now move markets. And the jury is still out on Bitcoin's true place in the long-term fabric of the investor's total picture. If you were there more than 10 years ago, congratulations, you are up 15,000%. If you jumped on board 4 years ago, you underperformed much of the stock market. Data by YCharts And if you were one of many who piled in at the start of 2024, when IBIT and 11 other spot Bitcoin ETFs made it easier to own crypto, you are up 87%, comfortably ahead of SPY over that same time. Now, with reference to this chart below, just 3 months ago IBIT led SPY by 168% to 44%. So that margin went from 124% to under 40% in a hurry. Data by YCharts But that again is my point. Stock picking or allocating across many types of stocks via ETFs is not nearly as productive or efficient as it once was. And the IBIT/SPY pair is part of a mountain of evidence supporting that, which grows every day. But since IBIT is still being treated as the nascent asset it is, this is still a good time to consider it. So it made it into my 10-ETF mix, something I frankly was not expecting. That is, until I whittled 4,400 ETFs down to my forced target of only 10. Now, I allocate tactically AMONG the 10 in that table above. I own at least a little of each at all times, as long as it is in the 10. A “permanent portfolio,” if you will. But where are the individual ETFs that make up the 10? While most will stay on the roster for a long time, some will be swapped out. Not when they look unattractive from a short-term return standpoint. When they are no longer providing a diversification benefit, either long-term or short-term. For now, IBIT makes the cut. I can control risk in it with that 2% minimum weighting and control my own excitement toward it (if that happens) with that 10% maximum weighting. And I remind myself that 5% is a “long-term expected average” position for IBIT within the 10 ETF portfolio, though 2% to 10% is the range I'm allowing myself to trade it within. To me, THAT is investing today. Not simply what I own, but how much and how often. Do I like SPY or IBIT better? I like both to different degrees at different times. And in the 10-ETF portfolio, I left SPY out entirely in its cap-weighted form, opting instead to use a mix of QQQ-DIA-RSP, as that trio is much more flexible than SPY alone (separate article on that coming soon). IBIT's technical chart does not look robust, and it is still subject to a combination of big risks. Just ask Michael Saylor (head man at Strategy, symbol MSTR). Those risks include a potential top in crypto enthusiasm, due in part to a peak in market liquidity, as well as repatriation of assets toward home currency assets (China and Japan are doing a lot of that currently). Barchart I've documented SPY's risks here many times for many years. And in its top-heavy form, it still hangs in there, for now. IBIT, SPY, and the bigger portfolio-wide impacts So, why do I make room for at least a 2% allocation to IBIT and also to each of QQQ, DIA, and RSP in that 10-ETF model portfolio? Because: I don't think I'm smarter than the market. I want diversification, but smart diversification, not “I think I'm diversified” diversification, which fails when we need it most. I have a mechanism to produce indicators as to how I want to rotate between those 4 ETFs and the 6 others pictured in the table. My method (ROAR) is not the subject of this article, but it will be in others. And it's there not to be pushed on people, but to show how SOMETHING should be your allocation mechanism. Not just “every 3 months I rebalance.” IBIT allows me to take some shots with small amounts of money, by design. In its brief history, it has had an 80% rally in 3 months and lost more than 25% in 3 months. It's 30% off its high as I write this. 3 months' time! So I expect there to be tactical opportunities to spot in the charts and rotate between that 2% and 10% allocation range. Data by YCharts Finally, using SPY as a proxy for the trio of stock ETFs I use in the 10-ETF portfolio, but the only “offensive weapon” I use in my 2-ETF portfolio (alongside BIL, a T-bill ETF), here's the range of possible outcomes based on the past. Since just before the pandemic, it has shown the potential to move more than 20% in either direction over a 3-month period. Data by YCharts That's a good reason to not set it and forget it, even if US equities are the default anchor of the portfolio. But those defense ETFs are the backstop, something I think more investors should consider the case for in their portfolios. This is all about risk management WHILE pursuing return over all time frames. My goal is to keep drawdowns below 5% and sacrifice some upside at times if that's what it takes. But am I limiting my ability to compete with a traditional “balanced” portfolio over time? Not at all, as I'll continue to discuss here in the new year. Because risk management does not mean capping returns. It means keeping enough capital intact at all times to live to fight another day, or year for that matter.",IBIT|BTC-USD|VOO|IVV|SPY|DIA|DJI|IWM|NDX|QQQ|SP500,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56731714,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258003,1767361211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Shift: Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Bold $30 Million Latin America Exit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitfarms-sells-paraguay-facility-exit/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Shift: Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Bold $30 Million Latin America Exit In a significant strategic pivot, Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms has finalized the $30 million sale of its Paraguay facility, marking a complete withdrawal from Latin American operations and redirecting capital toward emerging technology sectors. This move, announced via GlobeNewswire, signals a broader industry trend where cryptocurrency miners are diversifying their business models beyond pure digital asset production. Consequently, the transaction represents a calculated reallocation of resources in response to evolving market dynamics and technological opportunities. Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Major Portfolio Restructuring Bitfarms Ltd. has sold its 70-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility in Paso Pe, Paraguay, to Sympatheia Power Fund. The company disclosed the $30 million deal on May 15, 2025. This sale concludes Bitfarms’ operational presence in Latin America. The facility previously contributed to the company’s global hash rate. However, management has decided to reallocate these assets. Therefore, the proceeds will fund new ventures in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). The Paso Pe site began operations in 2022. It leveraged Paraguay’s abundant hydroelectric power. This renewable energy source offered a cost-effective advantage for energy-intensive mining. Nonetheless, the company’s strategic review identified greater potential elsewhere. Subsequently, executives approved the divestment. This decision aligns with a corporate focus on higher-margin infrastructure projects. Moreover, it optimizes the company’s geographical footprint for future growth. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Mining Industry’s Strategic Pivot The Bitcoin mining sector is undergoing a substantial transformation. Historically, companies competed primarily on hash rate and energy cost. Now, many are exploring adjacent technological fields. For instance, HPC and AI data centers require similar infrastructure. They need robust power supplies, advanced cooling, and secure facilities. Consequently, mining firms possess transferable expertise. This industry shift is driven by several key factors. Post-Halving Economics: The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards. This event pressured mining profitability, compelling operational efficiency. Energy Market Volatility: Global energy price fluctuations impact mining margins significantly, encouraging diversification. AI Infrastructure Demand: Demand for AI compute power is surging, creating a lucrative adjacent market for data center operators. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations in various jurisdictions introduce uncertainty, prompting portfolio adjustments. Capital Allocation: Investors increasingly reward diversified technology plays over single-asset commodity producers. This trend is not isolated to Bitfarms. Several other publicly-traded miners have announced similar strategic reviews. They are evaluating existing assets for alternative uses. Therefore, the Bitfarms Paraguay sale is a notable case study in this broader movement. Expert Perspective on Mining Industry Evolution Industry analysts view this move as a logical adaptation. “Mining companies are natural infrastructure operators,” notes a report from Compass Point Research. “Their core competency is managing large-scale, power-hungry computing operations in often remote locations. This skill set translates directly to the burgeoning HPC and AI data center market.” The report further highlights that the capital-intensive nature of mining necessitates constant evaluation of return on invested capital (ROIC). Financial data supports this strategic rationale. A comparison of key metrics illustrates the potential appeal of diversifying revenue streams. Potential Revenue Stream Comparison: Bitcoin Mining vs. AI/HPC Hosting Metric Traditional Bitcoin Mining AI/HPC Infrastructure Hosting Revenue Model Volatile; tied to Bitcoin price & network difficulty Predictable; often long-term contracted service fees Capital Intensity Very High (ASIC hardware) High (GPU/TPU clusters & cooling) Power Cost Sensitivity Extremely High High, but often passed through in contracts Hardware Lifespan ~3-4 years before obsolescence ~4-5 years, with more upgrade flexibility Regulatory Scrutiny Increasing globally Established and generally stable This comparative analysis shows why diversification is attractive. AI infrastructure offers more stable, contracted revenue. It also faces different regulatory pressures. Therefore, Bitfarms’ pivot aims to build a more resilient business model. The Future Focus: High-Performance Computing and AI Energy Infrastructure Bitfarms plans to reinvest the $30 million from the Paraguay sale. The capital will develop high-performance computing and AI-based energy infrastructure. Company executives have outlined a clear vision. They intend to leverage their existing expertise in large-scale electrical and thermal management. This expertise is critical for modern data centers. Specifically, AI training clusters generate immense heat. Efficient cooling solutions are paramount. Mining firms have years of experience solving this problem. The company’s existing facilities in the United States and Canada are potential candidates for conversion. These sites already have secured power contracts and robust grid connections. Furthermore, they are located in regions with supportive policies for technology investment. Redeveloping a portion of these sites for HPC could happen relatively quickly. This approach allows for a phased transition. It also mitigates risk by maintaining some Bitcoin mining revenue during the build-out. This strategic direction receives support from market forecasts. Demand for AI compute is projected to grow exponentially through the decade. Firms providing the physical infrastructure for this demand are well-positioned. Consequently, Bitfarms is entering a competitive but high-growth market. Their differentiator will be proven experience in managing megawatt-scale computing operations reliably and efficiently. Conclusion The sale of the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility represents a strategic inflection point for the company and reflects a wider evolution within the cryptocurrency mining industry. By exiting Latin America and reallocating $30 million toward high-performance computing and AI infrastructure, Bitfarms is proactively adapting to post-halving economics and capitalizing on the explosive demand for artificial intelligence compute capacity. This pivot highlights the increasing convergence between digital asset infrastructure and the broader technology sector, as firms leverage their core operational competencies to secure future growth in adjacent, high-value markets. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitfarms sell its Paraguay facility? Bitfarms sold the facility as part of a strategic shift to reallocate capital from pure Bitcoin mining toward developing infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence, aiming for more diversified and potentially stable revenue streams. Q2: Who purchased the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility? The 70 MW facility in Paso Pe was purchased by Sympatheia Power Fund for a total of $30 million, as reported by GlobeNewswire. Q3: Does this sale mean Bitfarms is exiting Bitcoin mining entirely? No, the sale marks an exit from Latin America, but Bitfarms continues its Bitcoin mining operations in other regions, such as the United States and Canada. The move is a portfolio optimization, not a full exit from the industry. Q4: What is high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure? HPC and AI infrastructure refers to the specialized data centers that house powerful computing clusters (like GPUs and TPUs) used for complex tasks such as scientific research, data analysis, and training artificial intelligence models. These facilities require massive amounts of power and advanced cooling, similar to Bitcoin mining farms. Q5: How might this strategic shift affect Bitfarms’ future financial performance? The shift could lead to a more diversified revenue model with longer-term contracts from HPC/AI hosting, potentially reducing volatility compared to earnings solely dependent on Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty. However, success depends on execution and competition in the new market.

YBTC’s holdings are primarily US Treasury bills, with complex options positions rather than traditional covered calls on Bitcoin ETFs. We go over the return profile to illustrate why most covered call funds don't pass our tests. Today, we will focus on Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). According to their website, this is what it does. The Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF is the first U.S. listed bitcoin covered call ETF. 1 The Fund offers exposure to exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) that have direct exposure to bitcoin * , subject to a cap, while providing the potential for current income. YBTC is an actively-managed ETF. Source: Roundhill The fund does not directly ""invest"" (we have to use the quotes here) in Bitcoin but uses exchange-traded products. When we read that, we thought it might just hold a Bitcoin ETF and then sell calls on that. You probably thought the same. Instead, when we examine the holdings, they present a drastically different picture. YBTC Their current AUM is around $224 million, so the entire AUM is invested in US Treasury bills. A tiny portion is also invested in Government Treasury mutual fund ($143,176), and some is held as cash ($798,464). The actual bitcoin-related holdings are strange, to say the least. Here's the first one. YBTC This appears to be a purchased call option. Normally with covered call funds, you would expect to see the underlying ETF, which in this case is iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), and then a call sold. So this would then appear with a negative sign. A purchased call is the opposite of what you would expect these funds to do. This is also right at the money ($49.72 strike) and close to expiration (Jan 16, 2026). Seeking Alpha So if Bitcoin stays here, the entire premium evaporates. That would be a 3.4% loss in one month on equity/AUM. But it gets more interesting. Against that purchased call, there is a sold call. This expires on January 2, 2026, and is of a higher strike price of $51.30. YBTC So the fund has created a long calendar call spread. Not something you would see in a typical covered call fund. This then brings us to our final position, which is one where significant premiums are sold. The fund has 45,048 contracts of the $49.72 put. YBTC For those that are unaware, cash-secured puts are identical to covered calls, adjusted for market interest rates. So if you sell a cash-secured put and in the interim park your money in a Treasury bill, you should get the same return profile as buying the stock and selling the identical strike covered call. There are some nuances depending on dividends and early exercise probabilities, but that all is not something we have to even think about with Bitcoin. So the overall position here is strange in some ways, as the fund did cash-secured puts for Bitcoin and then used that money to buy calls, partially offset by a calendar spread. Of course this is all just a moment in time, so we have no idea how this strategy has been changed over the course of the fund's history. What we do have is the pudding, where we can look for the proof. The Pudding If you run the price return profiles of IBIT and YBTC, you get a rather glaring contrast. Data by YCharts Of course the investor is now going, ""Wait, you didn't count my fat dividend checks."" We get that, and we will get to that. We always like to see this part first, as it gets to this decay principle where funds struggle to make the same dollars they did on day one as their NAV goes down. Now, there are some income investors who feel the rules of math don't apply. They seem to believe a fund with a $100 NAV per share can generate the same income even after its NAV drops 50%. But we made it past fourth grade (on the second attempt), so that is not a problem for us. Getting back to the total returns, we see that YBTC has been a real problem child here, lagging IBIT by a lot since inception. Data by YCharts That is a lot of ground to give up. The truly fascinating aspect about this fund is that it has delivered worse total returns in the recent bear market. Data by YCharts That's right. The fund has actually lagged IBIT during a rather steep drop. Verdict You couldn't pay us to speculate on Bitcoin. But if you are doing that, buy Bitcoin or IBIT and do your own covered calls. There are ways to do this intelligently that reduce your risk and improve your returns. Funds focused on generating income tend to miss the forest for the trees. There is too much emphasis on selling premiums rather than asking whether it is the right time to sell premiums. At the minimum, such funds should outperform strongly during bear markets to justify the loss of upside. You have to deliver on Sharpe if you can't deliver on Beta. Based on our opinion on Bitcoin and covered call funds and the data we have seen on this fund, we rate this a Strong Sell. Please note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult a professional who knows their objectives and constraints.

The company said it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with Sympatheia Power Fund, which is managed by Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. The transaction is expected to close within 60 days, subject to customary closing conditions. Refocus on North American HPC and AI Infrastructure Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon said the sale represents a decisive rebalancing of the company’s energy portfolio toward North America, allowing capital to be redeployed into higher-return opportunities. “This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC and AI energy infrastructure in 2026,” Gagnon said in a press release. He added that the sale of the Paso Pe site marks the culmination of a broader effort to exit Latin America and refocus the company’s management capital and operational priorities on North American power and infrastructure. Bitfarms Ditches BTC for AI After Shocking $46M Loss Bitfarms said it has increasingly positioned itself as an energy and digital infrastructure company expanding beyond bitcoin mining into high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, which it believes offer more long-term returns on invested capital. In November, the company said it will wind down its Bitcoin operations over 2026 and 2027 after posting a steep $46 million loss in the third quarter, nearly double its $24 million loss during the same period last year. @Bitfarms_io shares dropped 18% as it announced a wind-down in $BTC operations to pivot to AI infrastructure after a $46M Q3 loss. #Bitcoin #AI https://t.co/3Q7tsldFzS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Deal Structure and Payment Timeline Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer will acquire the shares of a single-purpose subsidiary that holds all operating assets related to the Paso Pe project. The proposed transaction values the site at up to $30 million. Bitfarms expects to receive $9 million in cash at closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. This amount includes a $1 million non-refundable deposit that has already been paid by the buyer. The company may receive up to an additional $21 million over the ten months following closing, contingent on the achievement of certain payment milestones. The structure of the transaction is expected to improve Bitfarms’ liquidity profile by accelerating the monetization of the asset while providing short-term financing supported by the operation. Buyer Targets Operational Continuity A representative for Sympatheia Power Fund said the acquisition supports the fund’s regional expansion strategy in crypto infrastructure and emphasized the importance of a smooth transition. “Our priority is an uninterrupted, seamless transition from day one, maintaining continuity at Paso Pe as we move into the next phase of growth,” said SPF representative Josh Murchie. Updated Energy Portfolio Post-Sale Following completion of the transaction, Bitfarms’ energy portfolio will be entirely North America–based. The company said it will operate 341 megawatts of energized capacity with an additional 430 megawatts under active development in the United States. Its total multi-year pipeline stands at 2.1 gigawatts, with roughly 90% located in the U.S. The post Bitfarms to Exit Latin America Selling 70 MW Paraguay Mining Site for Up to $30M appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitfarms|Mining|Paraguay,BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Traders on Polymarket appear cautious, while some big-name firms keep calling for big gains in 2026. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Market Odds And Trader Caution According to Polymarket prices, Bitcoin has just a 23% chance of reaching $150,000 before 2027. The odds are higher at lower targets: 47% for $120,000, 35% for $130,000 and 29% for $140,000. Traders are most comfortable with $100,000, which carries about an 80% chance. That spread shows bettors are pricing risk tightly as the clock runs toward the new year. Bitcoin closed 2025 in the red, a fact that has likely cooled some enthusiasm. Reports have disclosed that gold and silver hit fresh highs in the fourth quarter of 2025, while crypto prices held mostly flat. The old four-year halving cycle that many chartists relied on is being questioned, and that doubt is being priced in. Technical Signals Based on the latest Bitcoin price outlook, BTC is expected to climb 3% to about $91,815 by February 1, 2026. Technical signals point to a Bearish mood, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 28, reflecting Fear. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin posted gains on 15 of those days, or 50%, with price swings averaging 2%. Policy Shifts Could Change The Math US President Donald Trump is expected to name a new Federal Reserve chair soon, and many market participants are betting that interest rates will be cut afterward. That idea has already helped send precious metals higher. At the same time, regulators in Washington are pushing crypto bills such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, which backers say could give clearer rules and, in time, more institutional interest. Analysts Still Offer Bullish Targets Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly predicted that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of 2026, citing stronger institutional interest and better regulatory clarity as reasons for his bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bear Market Might Not Be New: Data Points To A 2-Month Slide Analysts at JPMorgan have suggested a theoretical Bitcoin price around $170,000 in 2026, based on a model comparing Bitcoin’s behavior to gold and assuming continued capital flows into the crypto market. Grayscale’s 2026 digital asset outlook expects Bitcoin to exceed its previous all-time high in the first half of 2026, implying a move above its record peak of around $126,000 (though not giving a specific numerical target, the implication is toward significant upward momentum). Policymakers, traders and analysts are all weighing different risks. Market prices reflect caution today, while forecasts offer a brighter view for the months ahead. Which one proves right will depend on policy moves, investor appetite and whether new trading patterns replace the cycle many thought they could count on.

The pledge arrives as South Korea’s financial regulator and central bank remain locked in a prolonged dispute over stablecoin issuance rules that have pushed comprehensive digital asset legislation into next year. According to the local report, Jeong told attendees at the Korea Exchange’s Seoul headquarters that new investment products, including virtual asset ETFs and derivatives, would be introduced as part of efforts to overcome the “ Korea Discount ” and upgrade the capital market. He also committed to deploying AI-based monitoring systems and strengthening crackdowns on stock manipulation through a joint response team. Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo. | Source: Yonhap Korea Exchange Ready, Regulators Still Divided The Korea Exchange’s readiness to launch crypto products contrasts sharply with regulatory delays that have stretched back years. The Financial Services Commission submitted a roadmap in June proposing spot crypto ETFs for late 2025, but the plan has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, South Korea’s comprehensive Digital Asset Basic Act remains stalled in 2026 after the Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea failed to reach an agreement on stablecoin governance . The central bank insists that stablecoins should be issued only by bank-led consortia, with lenders holding at least a 51% ownership stake. The FSC has resisted the fixed threshold, warning it could sideline technology firms and slow innovation in digital payments. Regulators also disagree on whether a new licensing committee is needed for stablecoin oversight. Beyond stablecoins, the draft law would introduce strict investor protections, including full-reserve custody requirements, and raise compliance standards for crypto service providers to match those in traditional finance. Initial coin offerings banned since 2017 could return under strict disclosure rules. Stablecoin issuers would be required to hold reserves entirely in bank deposits or government bonds, with 100% of those reserves entrusted to licensed custodians. South Korea’s comprehensive crypto law has been delayed to 2026 due to a dispute over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/jKP9L9n63S — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 The regulatory impasse continues despite strong political momentum from President Lee Jae-myung’s administration, which campaigned on easing digital asset restrictions. The ruling Democratic Party introduced legislation in June to amend the Capital Markets Act, expanding the definition of underlying assets for ETFs to include Bitcoin and other digital currencies. A separate bill proposed legalizing stablecoin issuance by domestic firms with a minimum capital of 500 million won. However, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has opposed the development of non-bank stablecoins due to monetary policy concerns. Enforcement Drive Continues Across Major Exchanges While policy debates drag on, enforcement actions have accelerated. The Financial Intelligence Unit imposed a ₩27.3 billion fine on Korbit in late December following approximately 22,000 anti-money laundering violations identified during October inspections. The regulator found failures in customer identification, unauthorized transactions with unregistered overseas platforms, and inadequate money-laundering risk assessments for new products. The Korbit penalty followed earlier sanctions against Upbit operator Dunamu, which received a three-month suspension on new customer accounts in February and a ₩35.2 billion fine in November. Bithumb, Coinone, and GOPAX remain under review as the FIU works through cases in inspection order, with total fines across the sector expected to reach hundreds of billions of won. South Korea is set to hit major crypto exchanges with new penalties over anti-money laundering failures, signaling a tougher enforcement phase for the industry. #SouthKorea #CryptoAML https://t.co/9r42trYMmE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Authorities are simultaneously expanding transaction monitoring requirements. The same late last month, a task force led by the FIU is reviewing whether to extend the travel rule to cover crypto transfers below 1 million won, closing a gap regulators say has enabled smurfing techniques used to evade reporting thresholds. The proposed changes would require exchanges to collect sender and recipient information for all virtual asset transfers, regardless of size. Mixed Signals From Financial Authorities The regulatory uncertainty has created contradictory guidance for asset managers. In July, the Financial Supervisory Service issued verbal warnings restricting the proportion of crypto-related stocks , such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, in domestic ETF portfolios, citing administrative guidance from 2017 that remains in effect. Several Korean ETFs already hold double-digit allocations to these companies through passive index tracking. However, industry participants argued that the restrictions create unfair advantages for US-listed crypto products while failing to prevent capital outflows. “Restricting only domestic ETFs will not stop the flow of funds, and in reality, many investors are already bypassing the market with U.S. ETFs,” one source noted at the time.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,750, meaning it closed the year 2025 below $100,000. This price action has added pressure to sentiment, and higher-timeframe indicators are pointing to growing exhaustion. According to a 3-month candlestick analysis shared on X by analyst Greeny, the way Bitcoin closed 2025 may carry deeper implications than most traders currently understand. 3-Month Bearish Engulfing Points To Weakness Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe shows the cryptocurrency just printed a large bearish engulfing candle that fully overtook the prior quarterly advance. This type of candle is rare on such a high timeframe and typically points to a decisive shift in control from buyers to sellers. The chart shared by Greeny shows that this engulfing structure formed after Bitcoin failed to hold above its 2025 highs above $120,000 in October, and this shows that the year ended in distribution. Interestingly, $106,700 is now an important level moving forward because it corresponds with the bottom of the previous 3-month candle. With Bitcoin now trading below that zone, it flips from support into a heavy resistance area for price action in Q1. Any recovery attempt in early 2026 would need to reclaim this level convincingly to avoid further rejection. Furthermore, the stochastic level near $108,000 is another important level to look at for Bitcoin’s price action in Q1 2026. According to Greeny, if the Bitcoin price closes below this zone after the first quarter, it would indicate continued downside pressure. Together, these levels form a tight ceiling overhead, meaning even strong relief rallies could struggle to transition into sustainable uptrends as we move into the new year. Bitcoin 3-month Candlestick Price Chart: @greenytrades on X Stochastic Exhaustion Points To A Possible Cycle Peak Another concerning element of Greeny’s analysis centers on the stochastic indicator. According to the analyst, this is the first time in Bitcoin’s history that the stochastic has reached the 80th percentile on the 3-month timeframe. This is otherwise notable because this is a zone generally associated with exhaustion and a local or bull cycle top. The chart also shows the red moving average crossing above the blue while sitting well below the stochastic band, a configuration Greeny interprets as confirmation of a local top. This setup is likely pointing to the end of the current bull cycle and will only be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to close above $108,000 by the end of March. Liquidity conditions across the entire crypto market tightened through late 2025 as the Central Bank of Japan maintained higher interest rates. This has led to Bitcoin underperforming compared to other notable assets, while precious metals such as gold and silver pushed to new price highs.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Specifically, respected on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez claims to have identified a Bitcoin death cross using the 10 and 50-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), per an X article published on January 1. Within the same article, the analyst explained that, in the past, such a signal preceded a BTC crash of between 53% – as in March of 2020 – and 67% – like in September of 2014. Historically, every Bitcoin $BTC death cross between the 10W and 50W SMA has led to a major correction: • Sep 2014: –67% • Jun 2018: –54% • Mar 2020: –53% • Jan 2022: –64% https://t.co/EWSDQeujJt pic.twitter.com/CEGle2ExXd — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 2, 2026 Simultaneously, Martinez explained he expects that a Bitcoin correction to between $38,000 and $50,000 – between 57% and 44% from the press time value – is likely. Still, the trading expert also noted with his BTC prediction that, rather than a purely detrimental situation, such a crash would once again turn Bitcoin into an attractive long-term investment. The pullback would all but ensure that the cryptocurrency’s upside potential is significantly greater than the downward pressure. Top commodity strategist forecasts massive 2026 Bitcoin crash On the other hand, hopeful BTC traders might have to wait until at least 2027 to again witness a major rally. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s senior commodity analyst, explained that he expects Bitcoin might crash toward $50,000 in 2026. He also revealed that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the cryptocurrency market – fell 19% in 2025, hinting at a more persistent downtrend. Bitcoin just broke a decade-long cycle Lastly, Bitcoin’s actual performance for the entire 2025 also indicates that the boom is, for the time being, over. Simultaneously, it showcased that the cryptocurrency market might be even harder to predict in the future. BTC 12-month price chart.

This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling discussions about its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this rally, from macroeconomic shifts to institutional adoption trends. Bitcoin Price Breaches a Critical Threshold The ascent of the Bitcoin price above $90,000 marks a new chapter in its volatile history. This movement is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of sustained buying pressure observed over recent weeks. Data from multiple trading platforms confirms the breakout, with Binance’s USDT pair serving as a key liquidity benchmark for the global market. Furthermore, this price action follows a period of consolidation below previous resistance levels, suggesting a fundamental shift in market sentiment. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a pattern of reaching round-number milestones that later become support zones. The journey from $70,000 to this new high involved navigating regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data releases, and shifting investor risk appetites. For instance, the asset’s performance often correlates inversely with traditional market fears, positioning it as a potential hedge for some portfolios. Therefore, the breach of $90,000 is being analyzed through both technical chart patterns and broader economic narratives. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Several interconnected factors are contributing to the current cryptocurrency rally. Primarily, renewed institutional interest has provided substantial buy-side volume. Major asset managers have continued to expand their digital asset offerings, channeling traditional capital into the space. Simultaneously, macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about currency devaluation and inflation in certain regions, have driven retail and institutional investors toward scarce digital assets. Institutional Adoption: Increased integration by payment processors and treasury allocations by public companies. Macroeconomic Hedge: Perceived as a digital store of value amid expansive fiscal policies. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements to the Bitcoin protocol enhancing its utility and security. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in key jurisdictions providing a more stable framework for investment. Moreover, the supply dynamics of Bitcoin play a crucial role. The predictable, diminishing rate of new coin issuance—a process known as the halving—creates a built-in scarcity mechanism. As adoption increases against this constrained supply, basic economic principles of supply and demand exert upward pressure on the Bitcoin price. This fundamental aspect distinguishes it from traditional fiat currencies and remains a core tenet of its investment thesis. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of volume and derivative market positioning in assessing the rally’s health. Notably, open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen alongside the price, but funding rates have remained relatively neutral. This suggests a balance between long and short positions, potentially indicating a healthier, less speculative advance compared to past parabolic moves. Experts from major financial research firms point to on-chain data, such as the growth in long-term holder supply and low exchange reserves, as signs of strong conviction among investors. Comparatively, the current rally exhibits distinct characteristics from the 2021 bull market. The table below outlines key differences: Market Aspect 2021 Cycle 2025 Cycle (Current) Primary Drivers Retail frenzy, meme coins, excessive leverage Institutional inflows, ETF products, macroeconomic narrative Leverage Levels Extremely High Moderate to High Regulatory Environment Highly uncertain Evolving with clearer frameworks On-chain Holder Behavior High exchange inflows Accumulation & withdrawal to cold storage This shift in market structure implies a potentially more mature and stable foundation for current price levels. However, analysts universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Risk management, therefore, is paramount for all market participants. The Ripple Effect Across Digital Asset Markets The breakthrough in the Bitcoin price invariably influences the broader digital asset ecosystem. Often termed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s performance frequently sets the tone for altcoins and other blockchain-based assets. In this instance, the rally has restored overall market capitalization to levels not seen in years, improving liquidity and investor confidence across the board. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have often shown correlated momentum, though the strength of this correlation can vary based on independent network developments. Simultaneously, the infrastructure surrounding cryptocurrency continues to evolve rapidly. Custodial services, regulatory-compliant exchanges, and financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs have created more accessible pathways for traditional capital. This institutional gateway effect is a critical component of the current market phase, differentiating it from earlier cycles dominated primarily by retail traders on less regulated platforms. The growing integration with legacy finance presents both opportunities for growth and new complexities regarding systemic interconnectedness. Conclusion The Bitcoin price surpassing $90,000 is a definitive milestone, reflecting a complex interplay of adoption, macroeconomics, and technological maturity. This achievement underscores Bitcoin’s persistent resilience and its growing absorption into the broader financial conversation. While volatility remains a defining feature, the market’s underlying structure appears to be evolving toward greater participation and sophistication. Ultimately, the journey toward and beyond this price point will be closely watched as a barometer for the entire digital asset class’s integration into the global economic system. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $90,040 on Binance USDT mean? This means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin (BTC) can be purchased or sold for 90,040 Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is a key pricing pair that reflects real-time global supply and demand. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin’s price is rising? Primary drivers include increased institutional investment through new financial products, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, continued adoption as a payment method, and its fixed, scarce supply schedule which contrasts with expansive monetary policy. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s current rally compare to 2021? The current rally appears more institutionally driven, with significant capital flowing through regulated ETFs and corporate treasuries. In contrast, the 2021 peak was characterized by higher retail leverage and excitement around meme coins and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Q4: Is Bitcoin’s price sustainable at this level? Sustainability depends on continued adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. While on-chain data and institutional interest provide a stronger foundation now, cryptocurrency markets are still young and subject to high volatility and unpredictable corrections. Q5: What is the impact of Bitcoin’s price on other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the overall market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin price typically increases capital flows into the entire crypto sector, boosting the prices of major altcoins. However, individual project fundamentals ultimately determine long-term performance relative to Bitcoin.

This surprising turn of events, reported by DL News in early 2025, follows his November 2024 sentencing to five years for orchestrating one of cryptocurrency’s most infamous thefts. Consequently, his release under the U.S. First Step Act raises profound questions about justice, rehabilitation, and the evolving legal landscape for digital asset crimes. Bitfinex Hacker Early Release Details and Legal Mechanism The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Ilya Lichtenstein’s early release this week. Authorities applied provisions of the First Step Act of 2018. This bipartisan federal law specifically aims to reduce recidivism. Furthermore, it promotes inmate rehabilitation through earned time credits. Lichtenstein reportedly qualified for these credits by participating in prison programming. His original five-year sentence stemmed from a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges connected directly to the 2016 Bitfinex security breach. Prosecutors originally charged Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, in February 2022. Their arrest followed a multi-year investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Agents traced the movement of 119,754 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the theft, the cryptocurrency was worth approximately $71 million. However, by the time of their arrest, its value had ballooned to a staggering $4.5 billion. This case remains one of the largest financial seizures in U.S. history. The 2016 Bitfinex Breach and Investigation Timeline Understanding the early release requires examining the original crime’s scale. The Bitfinex hack occurred on August 2, 2016. Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the exchange’s multi-signature wallet service. They successfully initiated over 2,000 unauthorized transactions. These transactions drained customer and corporate funds. The exchange immediately suspended all trading. It also announced a 36% socialized loss across all user accounts. For nearly six years, the stolen funds remained dormant. Then, in 2022, blockchain analytics and traditional investigative work converged. The IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit and HSI followed a complex trail. They linked the funds to wallets controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. A court-authorized search of their cloud storage accounts revealed private keys. These keys directly accessed the wallets holding the stolen Bitcoin. Key Events in the Bitfinex Case Date Event Aug 2, 2016 Bitfinex hack occurs; 119,754 BTC stolen. Feb 8, 2022 Lichtenstein and Morgan arrested in New York. Aug 2022 Both plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy. Nov 2024 Lichtenstein sentenced to 5 years in prison. Early 2025 Early release granted under First Step Act. The investigation showcased unprecedented collaboration. Agencies combined blockchain forensic tools with classic financial sleuthing. This approach set a new standard for prosecuting cryptocurrency crimes. First Step Act Provisions and Application to Cybercrime The First Step Act represents a significant shift in federal sentencing policy. Its primary goals include: Reducing mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenses. Expanding early release programs through earned time credits. Increasing rehabilitation programming within federal prisons. Improving conditions and reducing recidivism rates. Inmates earn credits by participating in Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) programs. These programs address needs like vocational training, education, and substance abuse treatment. Lichtenstein’s eligibility suggests he engaged with such programming. The Act does not distinguish between crime types for credit eligibility. Therefore, non-violent financial crimes like money laundering qualify. This application to a high-profile cybercrime case is particularly noteworthy. Impact on Cryptocurrency Security and Legal Precedents Lichtenstein’s early release sends ripples through the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, it tests the deterrent effect of prosecution for digital asset theft. Secondly, it highlights the tension between punishment and rehabilitation for technical crimes. The case already established several key legal precedents: Asset Forfeiture: The government successfully seized and sold billions in stolen crypto. Jurisdiction: U.S. courts asserted authority over crimes involving globally dispersed digital assets. Investigation Methods: The use of blockchain analytics as evidence gained judicial acceptance. Security experts note the hack forced major exchanges to overhaul their protocols. Today, most leading platforms use sophisticated cold storage solutions. They also employ multi-party computation (MPC) for key management. The Bitfinex incident remains a cautionary tale for the entire industry. Expert Analysis on Sentencing and Release Legal scholars specializing in cyberlaw offer critical perspectives. Professor Elena Carter of Stanford Law School notes, “The First Step Act focuses on rehabilitation for non-violent offenders. The court likely viewed the technical nature of the crime as non-violent, despite its massive financial scale.” Meanwhile, blockchain forensic analyst David Chen observes, “This early release doesn’t diminish the investigative breakthrough. The real victory was tracing and recovering the funds, which returned value to victims.” The case also involved Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, a rapper and entrepreneur. She received a shorter sentence and was released earlier. Their combined story of tech savvy, money laundering through complex transactions, and unconventional public personas captured global media attention. Conclusion The early release of Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein under the First Step Act concludes a landmark chapter in cryptocurrency legal history. This case demonstrated the formidable reach of U.S. law enforcement into the blockchain. It also tested new sentencing reforms on a high-stakes financial crime. Ultimately, the recovery of $4.5 billion in stolen assets stands as the investigation’s enduring legacy. The industry now watches how this precedent influences future prosecutions of digital asset theft and money laundering. FAQs Q1: What was the First Step Act, and why did it apply to Ilya Lichtenstein? The First Step Act is a 2018 U.S. federal law designed to reform sentencing and promote inmate rehabilitation. It applied to Lichtenstein because he qualified for earned time credits by participating in prison programming aimed at reducing recidivism, and his crime was classified as non-violent. Q2: How much Bitcoin was originally stolen in the 2016 Bitfinex hack? The hackers stole 119,754 Bitcoin from Bitfinex in August 2016. At the time of the theft, this was worth about $71 million. By the time of the arrest in 2022, the value had appreciated to approximately $4.5 billion. Q3: What happened to the stolen Bitcoin after the seizure? The U.S. government successfully seized the vast majority of the stolen Bitcoin. It then sold portions of the cryptocurrency through authorized auctions and market sales. The proceeds are held as recovered assets, with processes in place for potential victim restitution. Q4: How does this early release affect future cryptocurrency crime prosecutions? Legal experts believe the core precedent—successful investigation, seizure, and conviction—remains intact. The early release reflects sentencing policy, not investigative failure. It may, however, influence plea negotiations and sentencing arguments in future digital asset cases. Q5: What role did Ilya Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, play in the crime? Heather Morgan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and defraud the United States. Prosecutors alleged she helped launder the stolen funds through complex transactions, shell companies, and false invoices. She received a sentence shorter than Lichtenstein’s and was released earlier.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,961.21 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This sudden Bitcoin price movement has captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, prompting a deep dive into the underlying market mechanics and historical context. The drop represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and introduces fresh volatility into the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The descent below $89,000 marks a clear technical breakdown. Consequently, market participants are now scrutinizing order book liquidity and exchange flows. Major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken show similar price action, confirming a broad-based sell-off. Furthermore, the 24-hour trading volume has spiked by approximately 35%, indicating heightened activity. This Bitcoin price decline follows a period of consolidation just above the $90,000 psychological barrier. Market data reveals increased selling pressure from large wallet addresses, often called ‘whales.’ Historically, such movements often correlate with broader financial conditions. For instance, the current macroeconomic backdrop includes shifting expectations around central bank policies. Analysts frequently compare present volatility to past cycles, like the Q2 2024 correction. A short-term sell-off can sometimes establish a stronger foundation for future growth. Therefore, understanding the immediate catalysts is crucial for a complete market picture. Technical Indicators and On-Chain Data Key technical levels provide further insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory. The 50-day moving average, a closely watched metric, now acts as dynamic resistance. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory. On-chain analytics from Glassnode show a net outflow from exchanges, suggesting some investors are moving holdings to cold storage. This ‘hodling’ behavior often signals long-term conviction despite short-term price pain. The network’s hash rate remains robust, underscoring fundamental security strength. Analyzing Potential Catalysts for the Decline Several interrelated factors may have contributed to this cryptocurrency market downturn. First, regulatory developments continue to create uncertainty in major economies. Second, profit-taking after a sustained rally above $85,000 was a widely anticipated risk. Third, movements in traditional markets, like bond yields or equity indices, can trigger correlated sell-offs in digital assets. Finally, leveraged positions being liquidated on derivatives exchanges can exacerbate downward momentum. It is essential to distinguish between causation and correlation. For example, not every market move has a single, identifiable news trigger. Often, a confluence of minor factors creates the conditions for a shift. Market sentiment, measured by tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, had been in ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. A reversion to a more neutral or fearful reading is a common market-clearing event. Macroeconomic Pressure: Shifts in inflation data or interest rate expectations. Overleveraged Markets: Cascade of long position liquidations on futures platforms. Regulatory Headlines: News flow concerning digital asset legislation or enforcement actions. Profit-Taking: Natural sell pressure after a multi-week appreciation cycle. Historical Volatility and Bitcoin Market Cycles Bitcoin’s history is defined by volatility. A pullback of 5-15% during a bull market phase is statistically normal. For context, the 2021 cycle saw over a dozen corrections exceeding 10% before reaching its all-time high. This perspective helps investors maintain a long-term view. The current Bitcoin price action fits within established patterns of advance, consolidation, and correction. Seasoned analysts often view these dips as potential entry points rather than signals of a trend reversal, provided core fundamentals remain intact. Comparing asset classes highlights Bitcoin’s unique risk profile. Traditional safe-haven assets like gold typically exhibit lower volatility. However, Bitcoin’s potential for asymmetric returns attracts a different investor profile. The digital gold narrative persists, but its trading patterns remain distinct. This latest move serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent price discovery process, which is often volatile and inefficient. Expert Commentary and Market Sentiment Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize context. ‘Market corrections are healthy,’ notes a veteran trader from a major digital asset fund. ‘They flush out weak leverage and reset derivatives markets.’ Another analyst points to on-chain metrics showing accumulation by long-term holders during dips. This behavior suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Sentiment on social trading platforms has quickly shifted from bullish to cautious, reflecting the fast-paced nature of crypto markets. Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The Bitcoin price decline has a pronounced ripple effect. Altcoins, which often correlate with BTC, have generally moved in tandem, with some experiencing more severe losses. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dipped accordingly. However, this correlation sometimes decouples, with select projects showcasing independent strength. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) trading volumes may see secondary impacts if the downturn persists. Institutional investment flows, tracked through products like Bitcoin ETFs, will be a key metric to watch in the coming days. Sustained inflows during a price drop could signal strong institutional conviction. Conversely, outflows might indicate a broader risk-off move. The interaction between spot market selling and derivatives market liquidations creates a complex feedback loop that analysts will study closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $89,000 represents a significant moment in the 2025 market cycle. This movement underscores the volatile and interconnected nature of digital asset markets. While short-term price action captures headlines, the long-term narrative around Bitcoin’s adoption, technological development, and role as a digital store of value remains multifaceted. Investors are advised to focus on risk management, fundamental research, and a time horizon that aligns with their financial goals. The coming days will be critical for observing whether this level holds as support or if further downside exploration occurs. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $89,000? The decline likely resulted from a combination of profit-taking after a rally, liquidations of leveraged long positions, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. It is a typical correction within a volatile market. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual strategy. Some view corrections as potential buying opportunities, but timing the market is notoriously difficult. Conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q3: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major altcoins have high correlation with Bitcoin and often move in the same direction, at least in the short term. The entire crypto market cap typically reacts to significant BTC movements. Q4: What key level should traders watch next? Traders are monitoring the $88,000 and $85,000 levels as potential next supports. A reclaim of $90,000 would be viewed as a bullish signal for a potential recovery. Q5: Does this price drop change Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? A single price correction rarely alters long-term fundamental theses based on adoption, scarcity, and utility. Volatility is an inherent feature of the asset class, and long-term investors often look through short-term fluctuations.

The facility will be acquired by the Sympatheia Power Fund, a crypto infrastructure investor. Bitfarms will sell its 70 MW facility in Paraguay, as it rebalances its portfolio of reliable centers and focuses on North America. With the sale, Bitfarms leaves its South American mining operations. The Paso Pe site in Paraguay is expected to transfer within 60 days, under the management of the Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. ‘ I’m pleased to announce the strategic sale of our Paso Pe site and decisive rebalancing of our energy portfolio to 100% North American. This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC/AI energy infrastructure in 2026, where we believe we will be able to generate much stronger returns on our invested capital with HPC/AI, ’ said Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon. Bitfarms is a mid-range mining company with 19.5 EH/s in total BTC mining power. The company is also within the top 100 of BTC treasury holders, retaining 1,827 BTC from its mining activity. The Paraguay center will go toward Sympatheia Power Fund’s expansion plans for Latin America. The mining center will retain operations, with no outages during the transfer of ownership. Bitfarms sells BTC mining center for $30M Bitfarms will sell the Paso Pe BTC mining facility at a $30M valuation, with $9M in cash and up to $21M over a 10-month period. After the deal, Bitfarms will focus solely on North American energy assets while improving its liquidity profile for further expansion. Bitfarms negotiated a $300M long-term debt facility in April 2025 as part of its energy expansion plans. Bitfarms retains 341 MW in energy capacity, with another 430 MW in active development. The multi-year plan is to reach a total of 2.1 GW in data centers, of which 90% will be based in the USA. Bitfarms has been on an expansion track since 2017, and is one of the leaders in North American mining infrastructure. Bitfarms benefits from AI data center boom The sale arrives at a time when Bitcoin mining operations are often converted to high-uptime AI centers, based on existing contracts for reliable electricity. Following the deal announcement, BITF shares were trading at $2.96 (3.93 CAD), up over 32% net for the past year. The period coincided with revenue growth for BITF, as the miner benefited from the growing prices. In early 2026, BTC miners are still operating at near peak capacity, despite the distressing market conditions. Even smaller mining companies are viewed as potential bets with high returns. BITF is expected to break out based on its ongoing data center plans. BITF is competing with other recently hot mining companies like Riot and IREN, with stocks rising despite the slower BTC market growth. Get seen where it counts.

The cryptocurrency’s price actions have been choppy and uncertain for several weeks. It dipped to a local low of $84,500 on December 19, shortly after the US CPI numbers for November came out, but quickly tightened its trading range. In the following ten days or so, it stood between $90,500 and $86,500. It tried to take down the upper boundary on at least three occasions since then, but each attempt was met with an immediate rejection and a subsequent retracement to the lower boundary. The current business week began similarly, as BTC spiked to $90,500, where the bears stepped up and pushed it south to under $87,000. The bulls intercepted the move and provided an immediate relief rally to $88,000. Sideways action continued in the following days, but BTC ultimately closed 2025 below $88,000, which was a 6-7% yearly decline. January 1 was expectedly a dull trading day, but bitcoin went on the offensive earlier today. It tapped $90,000 once again, only to be stopped and driven south by a grand and a half. Nevertheless, it has managed to bounce off and now sits above $89,000. This means that it’s over 2% up weekly, but its market cap has declined by 0.6% weekly as most alts have marked bigger gains since last Friday. These include ETH, BNB, SOL, and ADA, all of which are up by 5-6%. DOGE has risen by more than 9%, and so has ZEC. XMR, HYPE, and BCH are among the few alts in the red weekly.

As explained above, BTC finished 2025 in the red. While that’s not a first, it did break history as bitcoin had never ended a post-halving year with a negative performance until now. The $10,000 Trump Trade: What Actually Made Money Since Inauguration Day . Trump re-entered the White House on the white crypto horse due to his multiple promises. However, data from almost a year later shows that none of the larger-cap digital assets were in the green, unlike the US stock market or, even better, the precious metal industry. Ethereum Suffered Worst Year Since 2018: 9 Red Months in 2025 . The second-largest cryptocurrency also tapped a new all-time high in 2025, but its overall performance was quite the opposite. It saw nine monthly closures in the red, which made it its worst year since 2018. Tether Confirms $779M Bitcoin Purchase Despite Weak Market Momentum . The Paolo Ardoino-led stablecoin giant continues to accumulate BTC on a frequent basis, buying 8,888.8888888 units in Q4 2025.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-ignore-xrp-at-your-peril-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Crypto markets often hide the most important moves behind quiet accumulation rather than flashy headlines. While retail chatter and media narratives dominate daily attention, institutional actors frequently position themselves well ahead of obvious catalysts . XRP now sits at one of these critical inflection points, signaling that large-scale players may be preparing for a major market shift. The insight came from X Finance Bull, who shared recent institutional flow data on X, highlighting XRP’s unusual stability compared to other top cryptocurrencies. According to the analysis, while Bitcoin and Ethereum saw billions in outflows over November and December 2025, XRP maintained steady net inflows, signaling deliberate accumulation rather than retail-driven speculation. Institutional Flows Highlight Strategic Positioning X Finance Bull pointed out that Bitcoin experienced $3.48 billion in outflows in November and $1.09 billion in December, while Ethereum lost $1.42 billion and $616 million in the same period. XRP, however, saw only $666 million in November and $499 million in December, all positive net inflows. These numbers suggest that institutions actively moved capital into XRP while other major assets faced liquidity drains. IGNORE $XRP AT YOUR PERIL INSTITUTIONS ARE FRONT-RUNNING THE MARKET If you still think ETFs are only about Bitcoin and Ethereum, you’re missing what’s right in front of you Bitcoin saw outflows of $3.48B in November and $1.09B in December. Ethereum lost $1.42B in… https://t.co/gC79IXRRoW pic.twitter.com/V35OxMkYFM — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 1, 2026 This pattern demonstrates more than casual interest. Institutions anticipate regulatory clarity, infrastructure upgrades, and new liquidity corridors, often positioning themselves before these changes reach the public eye. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that professional investors view it as a strategically vital asset in the emerging digital finance ecosystem. ETFs and XRP’s Overlooked Potential Many investors still associate crypto ETFs primarily with Bitcoin and Ethereum. X Finance Bull emphasizes that this narrative overlooks a critical development: institutional capital increasingly targets XRP as regulatory frameworks and market infrastructure evolve. Unlike retail-driven surges, these flows reflect structured positioning in anticipation of XRP’s adoption as a bridge asset in regulated payments and cross-border settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This approach underlines XRP’s growing independence from short-term market sentiment. Institutions prioritize utility, liquidity, and compliance over hype, and XRP now benefits from these long-term fundamentals. Following Capital Flows Over Headlines The data reinforces a key principle: flows often lead markets. While headlines highlight trending stories, institutional movements reveal where smart money expects value to materialize. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that investors are betting on its future as an essential infrastructure asset, rather than short-term gains. As financial institutions integrate blockchain solutions and liquidity corridors expand, XRP stands poised for broader adoption. Ignoring these signals risks missing early positioning in what may become one of the most structurally significant crypto assets in the next market cycle. By tracking institutional flows rather than narratives, market participants gain a clearer perspective on XRP’s strategic importance and its potential to outperform other major cryptocurrencies.

BTC could sell off immediately after the January FOMC meeting, or even sooner. By comparing BTC to changes in factors that influence real yield trajectories, I assert that BTC’s latest rally has been running on borrowed time since September. Regulatory optimism and one-off positive events may support BTC in the short run, but they are unlikely to alter the broader trajectory. This article concludes a three-part BTC series examining dominance trends, money supply dynamics, and real yields—all of which collectively, and independently, point towards a BTC bear phase. Recently, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management increased exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which could be seen as an indication that the coin may rally further. While I believe in BTC’s long-term growth prospects, in line with Ms. Wood's target of $650,000 to $1.5M by 2030 , I don’t believe her recent BTC and related portfolio additions were to benefit from a short-term rally because my analysis of dominance numbers and money supply in previous articles indicated otherwise. Below is a summary of those two articles, which you may skip and move to the next section if you’ve been following my work. On December 18, 2025, my article titled “ Exit 200%+ Yield MSTY - And Don't Look Back ” argued that dominance numbers are signaling a crypto risk-off sentiment. Precisely, the dominance of BTC hasn’t changed since early November, whereas the dominance of altcoins has diminished. In that timeframe, though, stablecoin's dominance has shot up, indicating that many investors now prefer holding cash over crypto. Then, my article titled “ IBIT: The Risk Of Bitcoin's Decline To $30K ,” published on December 22, 2025, established that there’s a strong correlation between expected money supply changes and BTC. I advocated that the Fed may not embark on any meaningful quantitative easing in the coming years. In the absence of such M2 tailwinds, investors will likely rotate out of crypto. More Evidence In my view, those two articles should’ve been enough for readers to reconsider their BTC positions, especially if their entry price was more than $30,000—my price target. Even still, I’ll provide further evidence to support my assertion that BTC is headed south. To that end, please consider the chart below, which plots BTC prices against changes in real yields (referred to as RYC going forward). BTC-USD vs. 10-Year TIPS YoY % Change (Weekly, Sep 2014 – Dec 2025) (Author's Work - Data from Yahoo and FRED) From a surface-level view, the inverse relationship between BTC and RYC is quite evident: when RYC falls, BTC rallies, and vice versa. Also, BTC rallies usually lag RYCs. That inverse relationship exists because BTC is a non-yielding asset, and when yields are expected to rise, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets goes up, diminishing their attractiveness. The pertinent question then is: what drives RYC? Below is a quick rundown of every RYC directional pivot since the pandemic: RYC collapsed at the start of the pandemic due to the Fed’s zero rates and QE-until-necessary policies in response to the looming threat of a severe pandemic-induced recession and deflation. RYC started accelerating in early 2021, driven by rate hike expectations, which in turn were driven by inflation and growth expectations that had risen based on the possibility of vaccine rollouts. Inflation peaked in mid-2022, indicating that the Fed was approaching terminal rates. An expectation that gained further credence when the yield curve inverted in October 2022 , raising fears of an imminent recession. Consequently, RYC commenced a downward leg at the end of 2022, even though the Fed continued to hike rates until July 2023, because changes in both inflation and GDP trended downward. Inflation reached a point of stabilization at the start of 2024, when it fell to ~2.6%, quite close to the Fed's target—an event coupled with a flattening of the GDP change curve as well. But GDP had softened more than anticipated, raising fears and expectations of a weak economy, causing RYC to dive deeper. To manage that adverse situation, the Fed cut rates by 50 bps on September 18, 2024, and then delivered two more cuts in the same year. RYC changed direction in October 2024—when the market ascertained that the economy would be stable and GDP growth would normalize after the Fed's actions. Finally, RYC pivoted downward slightly at the end of 2024 when market participants believed the economy had digested the stimulatory effects of rate cuts. With all that information presented in this section, it is safe to assert that changes in expectations of long-term inflation and growth are among the primary drivers of RYC trajectories and thus, BTC cycles. Important Nuance Note that I have used the words “RYC trajectories” and “expectations of long-term inflation and growth” intentionally because trajectories and expectations are what matter, rather than singular events. If this nuance isn’t taken into consideration, investors may enter or exit positions at inopportune times. One such inopportune time was when rates were cut in October 2025, leading to only a slight drop in RYC but a big drawdown in BTC ($110,000 to roughly $85,000), i.e., the inverse relation between the two didn’t hold. That decoupling occurred because there were no changes in expectations of inflation and/or growth. Plus, Powell said that another rate cut in December is not a “foregone conclusion,” indicating a possible end to the rate cut cycle of 2025 and a stable economy going forward. In fact, it can be said that BTC’s long-haul price rally has been living on borrowed time since the September FOMC meeting, when Powell mentioned that cuts going forward would be more of a risk management initiative because the summary of economic projections hasn’t changed much (reference: Quote 1 in the appendix). Fed’s Path Forward Historically, the Fed has implemented insurance cuts multiple times, totaling 75 bps in all cases. (Source for rate cuts history: Federal Funds Rate History 1990 to 2026 ). In 2019, to manage the adverse effects of a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. In 2002, to further stimulate anemic economic recovery following the Dot-Com crisis. In 1998, to manage risks arising from the Asian Currency Crisis and the collapse of LTCM. In 1995, to stimulate a stagnant and weaker-than-expected labor market. Rates have already been cut by 75 bps since September 2025, which is why it's reasonable to assume that the Fed Funds rate won't change for the foreseeable future. An assertion further supported by the Fed’s latest economic projections , indicating a 2.4% PCE inflation, a GDP growth rate of 2.3%, and a Fed Funds rate of 3.4% for 2026. Moreover, Powell's statements from the October and December FOMC press conferences clearly indicate that if it weren’t for tariffs, inflation would be very close to the Fed’s target of 2% (reference: Quotes 2 and 3 in the appendix). Finally, he has said many times, and something I discussed in an article here , that tariff-induced inflation is a one-off event whose detrimental effects diminish over time. In summary, inflation is projected to subside in the coming months, GDP is projected to grow, and the Fed has delivered most of its rate cuts. Thus, RYC won’t experience any dramatic trajectory changes. Conclusion In my article on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) referenced/linked earlier, I stated that BTC will bottom between $30,000 and $20,000. To reach that level, however, it’ll experience multiple dramatic drawdowns. As mentioned before, I believe that BTC’s last strong sell-off, which caused it to drop from around $110,000 to roughly $85,000 within weeks, occurred because of normalization of growth and inflation, even though a rate cut was delivered. Therefore, I expect another drawdown, causing BTC to drop to its next resistance level of around $60,000, to occur after the next Fed meeting when an end to the current rate-cut cycle is officially announced—eliminating any doubts about the economy deteriorating further. Could the drop happen earlier? Yes, it depends on the payroll numbers and is quite tricky to understand. In my opinion, market participants, as of now, are quite convinced that there won't be any further rate cuts. But there's also some lingering doubt left along the lines of “What if things get worse in the labor market?” If, however, payroll numbers for December were to present a positive surprise, those doubts would be decisively eliminated, along with doubts about the end of the rate cuts cycle. In such a scenario, BTC may crash before the next FOMC meeting. The primary risk to my thesis is what I’ve already stated in other articles: singular events, such as regulatory changes and institutional participation, serving as tailwinds for BTC. I’d, however, like to further qualify that assertion by adding that such changes may only lead to ephemeral BTC rallies because its long-haul use as an extreme inflation hedge would be irrelevant in the coming economic environment. Lastly, it goes without saying that this ‘strong sell’ recommendation is not only for BTC but also for ETFs derived from it, such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), or corporations that are directly correlated to BTC prices, such as Strategy ( MSTR ). Appendix: Quotes From FOMC Press Conferences Quote 1: September press conference (pages 6 and 7): Yeah, I think you could think of this, in a way, as a risk-management cut, because if you look at the SEP, actually the projections for growth this year and next actually ticked up just a little bit and inflation and unemployment didn’t really move. So what’s different now? What’s different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market. You’ve seen—you know, we were looking at 150,000 jobs a month at the time of the last meeting, and now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers. And I didn’t—I don’t want to put too much emphasis on payroll job creation, but it’s just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off. And that tells you that it’s time to take that into account in our, you know, in our policy. Quote 2: October press conference (page 11): One is that inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2 percent goal. We estimate—people have different estimates of what that is, but it might be five- or six-tenths, and so if it’s 2.8, then core PCE, not including tariffs, might be 2.3 or 2.4, in that range, something like that. Quote 3: December press conference (page 23): And I think the evidence is kind of growing that what's happening here is services inflation coming down and that's offset by increases in goods, and that goods inflation is entirely in sectors where there are tariffs. So that does build on the story. And, so far, it's only a story that this is -- that the goods inflation, which is really the source of the excess at this point, that that -- almost more than half the source of the excess inflation is goods -- is tariffs.",BTC-USD|IBIT|BITO|FBTC|GBTC|MSTR|IBIT:CA|MSTR:CA|MSTY|MSTY:CA,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Bitcoin Expected To Revisit $90,000 Levels In 2026 Market technician Jonathan Carter has shared four new price targets for Bitcoin this year, taking on a bullish stance despite the broader market downtrend and ongoing volatility. The analyst first highlighted a technical structure on BTC’s 8-hour chart that suggests a major price move is coming. Related Reading: People Are Not Ready For Bitcoin; Analyst Reveals What’s Coming Next According to his chart analysis, Bitcoin has been forming a symmetrical triangle since December last year and is now approaching a critical decision point as the pattern nears its apex. Notably, this triangle structure has often preceded aggressive directional moves, suggesting that the market may be gearing up for bullish turnover . For his first bullish target, the analyst expects Bitcoin to surge to $94,000, viewing this area as an initial reaction level following a complete breakout above the $80,000 region. Notably, the chart shows that the $94,000 target was a previous consolidation and minor rejection point during earlier market phases. A move into this area would signal that buyers are successfully pushing prices beyond short-term resistance. Closely following that level is the $97,500 target. The chart indicates that this region previously acted as a pivot where the price struggled to maintain momentum. If Bitcoin holds above $97,000, it could also indicate strengthening bullish control and increase the probability of continuation. Carter’s chart shows that both buyers and sellers have been active , but neither side has maintained dominance, resulting in narrower price swings. This balance suggests that the market is consolidating and may be waiting for a trigger to resolve the structure. Although BTC continues to trade around $88,000, Carter believes the cryptocurrency’s broader structure favors an upside continuation. However, he notes that a confirmation is required before the market can break out and recover from the downtrend. Analyst Sets BTC’s Next Two Targets Above $100,000 For his final two targets, Carter has forecasted a move above the $100,000 psychological level . If Bitcoin successfully clears the triangle resistance, the next major objective is the $100,500 level. Beyond that, the analyst has forecasted a final upside target of around $106,000, representing a roughly 19% surge from current levels. Carter has also marked $106,000 as a sell zone , suggesting that a move into this region would likely attract profit taking , but reaching it would confirm a strong bullish expansion from the triangle pattern. Notably, a clearly marked support zone sits near the lower boundary of the triangle around the $80,000 range. This area has been tested multiple times and continues to hold, reinforcing the validity of Bitcoin’s structure.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Jonathan Carter|Profit-taking|Symmetrical Triangle Formation,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling intense discussion among investors and analysts globally. Consequently, this price action prompts a deeper examination of the converging factors behind this rally and its potential implications for the broader financial landscape. Bitcoin Price Achieves a New Zenith The ascent past $90,000 marks Bitcoin’s highest valuation since its last major cycle peak. According to data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the move was characterized by strong buying volume and occurred during Asian and European trading hours. This price level consolidates gains from a multi-week uptrend that began in early 2025. Furthermore, the rally appears broad-based, with increased institutional activity noted across major regulated exchanges. Several immediate catalysts contributed to this bullish momentum. Firstly, recent regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has reduced market uncertainty. Secondly, continued adoption by traditional finance (TradFi) firms for treasury reserves has provided a steady demand baseline. Finally, macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns in several economies, have renewed interest in Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties. Analyzing the Drivers of the Cryptocurrency Rally This rally is not an isolated event but the result of sustained fundamental developments. The network’s underlying health metrics remain robust. For instance, the hash rate—a measure of computational security—continues to set new records, reinforcing network integrity. Simultaneously, development activity on scaling solutions like the Lightning Network has accelerated, improving transaction efficiency and utility. Market structure has also evolved significantly. The table below contrasts key metrics from the previous cycle peak to the current environment: Metric Previous Cycle (~$69k Peak) Current Environment (~$90k) Futures Open Interest Extremely High, Leveraged More Balanced, Less Speculative Spot ETF Flows Not Available Consistent Net Inflows On-Chain Holder Behavior High Exchange Inflows Increased Long-Term Holding (HODLing) Institutional Custody Growing Widespread and Mature This data suggests a more mature and structurally sound market foundation supporting current prices. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of macro-economic factors. “The breach of $90,000 is technically significant,” notes a market strategist from a major investment bank, citing on-chain data that shows a large volume of Bitcoin moved into wallets with no history of spending. “We are observing a fundamental shift where Bitcoin is increasingly treated as a strategic asset rather than a purely speculative one.” Meanwhile, blockchain data firms report that the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains near all-time highs. This metric, often called the “HODL wave,” indicates strong conviction among long-term investors. Such behavior typically reduces available sell-side pressure, a crucial factor for sustaining price advances. The Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to this point provides essential context. Each major cycle has been defined by a new wave of adoption and a re-rating of its fundamental value proposition. The 2020-2021 cycle was largely driven by institutional discovery and pandemic-era fiscal policy. The current cycle, however, seems intertwined with global monetary policy normalization and Bitcoin’s integration into legacy financial infrastructure through spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Looking forward, several key levels and factors will be watched closely: Technical Resistance: The $95,000 to $100,000 zone is viewed as the next major psychological hurdle. Macro Sensitivity: How Bitcoin correlates with traditional risk assets like tech stocks in a changing interest rate environment. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing policy frameworks in the EU, UK, and US will impact market access and stability. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements in privacy, scalability, and smart contract functionality via layers like Taproot and sidechains. Ultimately, the market’s ability to hold gains above previous all-time highs will be a critical test of this new valuation paradigm. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $90,000 represents a pivotal chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This milestone reflects a complex interplay of improved market structure, deepening institutional participation, and enduring macroeconomic narratives. While volatility remains an inherent feature, the current price discovery above previous cycle highs suggests a market maturing through successive phases of adoption. The focus for investors and observers now shifts to whether this **Bitcoin price** level can form a durable foundation for the next stage of growth in the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly caused Bitcoin to jump above $90,000? A1: The move resulted from a combination of factors: sustained inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, positive regulatory developments in several countries, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty driving demand for alternative assets. It was not a single event but a convergence of sustained bullish catalysts. Q2: How does the current market differ from when Bitcoin last hit a record high? A2: Key differences include significantly higher institutional custody, the presence of regulated spot ETFs creating constant buy-side pressure, lower leverage in derivatives markets, and a larger proportion of the supply being held long-term, indicating stronger investor conviction. Q3: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this rally? A3: Investment timing depends entirely on individual risk tolerance and goals. Financial advisors universally recommend that cryptocurrency should only constitute a small, allocated portion of a diversified portfolio, never funds needed for essentials. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Q4: What are the main risks to Bitcoin’s price at this level? A4: Primary risks include sudden, restrictive regulatory changes in a major economy, a sharp reversal in global liquidity conditions, a critical security flaw discovered in the protocol, or a prolonged downturn in traditional markets causing a “risk-off” sell-off across all asset classes. Q5: What is the significance of the $90,000 price point? A5: Beyond being a round number, breaking decisively above the previous all-time high (around $69,000) is a major technical and psychological achievement. It confirms a new bullish market cycle and shifts the entire historical price range, potentially attracting a new wave of institutional and retail interest.

Investors have begun aggressively buying the dip to start the new year, shaking off the stagnation that characterised the final weeks of December. Over the past 24 hours, the total crypto market cap regained its footing above the psychological $3 trillion mark, having rallied roughly 2% to $3.12 trillion at press time. Market sentiment showed signs of relief as well, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbing 8 points to 36. While this still sits in “Fear” territory, it marks a significant move out of the Extreme Fear doldrums that persisted throughout the holiday season. Altcoins were the biggest beneficiaries of this liquidity injection, with meme coins stealing the show throughout the day. Led by Pepe Coin (PEPE), which saw double-digit gains, the sector outperformed the broader market. Other major meme assets, including Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), were also trading firmly in the green at the time of publication, fueled by a renewed appetite for high-beta plays. Why is Bitcoin price and crypto market up today? Bitcoin and the overall crypto market’s rally today has been driven by a combination of seasonal trends and a resurgence in global risk appetite. One of the clearest factors at play is the “January Effect,” as investors who closed out loss-heavy positions in December for tax purposes are now redeploying capital into the market. This new-year reset has historically sparked inflows, but it’s been especially pronounced this time given the steep end-of-year selloffs. Bitcoin price, for instance, had pulled back nearly 30% from its October peak of $126,000, and many viewed the $85,000 to $87,000 zone as a compelling long-term support range. Today’s move suggests those dip-buying efforts are now materializing with more conviction, aided by whale activity. On-chain data over the past two days has shown a notable uptick in large-holder accumulation, adding weight behind the bounce. At the same time, open interest in futures has risen more than 2%, topping $130 billion, which is a clear nod that leveraged traders are entering the market with bullish bets. This kind of futures-led growth alongside spot price movement tends to confirm underlying momentum. Beyond the crypto-native catalysts, global risk appetite has also returned. Equity futures for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have pointed to a positive 2026 open, as traders begin to price in the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts by March. The ongoing wave of IPOs and improving macro outlook have pulled traditional investors back into high-growth sectors, and crypto often sits high on that list when risk sentiment turns favorable. There’s also a structural tailwind from regulatory clarity that began to take shape late last year. With the GENIUS Act setting clearer guidelines for digital assets and stablecoin frameworks becoming more predictable, institutional participants have more confidence navigating the space. This is already playing out in spot ETF flows, where selling pressure in both Bitcoin and Ethereum has begun to subside. Even meme coins have helped drive sentiment, as traders rotate into riskier assets in search of higher short-term upside. The rally across tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB has added to the sense that capital is flowing more freely again. What’s next for Bitcoin price? For Bitcoin bulls, reclaiming the psychological support level at $90,000 would be a strong validation point that could open the door to further upside. Since mid-December, this zone has acted as a key ceiling, with each rally attempt falling short of a clean break. A decisive push above it could reset the narrative and give traders confidence to begin positioning for a potential return to six-figure territory in the months ahead. Per the 24-hour liquidation heatmap, Bitcoin’s latest rally has clearly forced a large wave of short liquidations, particularly clustered near the $88,000 to $90,000 range. See below: Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The visual density in these upper bands, coupled with real-time data showing $271.65 million in total liquidations, of which $217.82 million were shorts, points to how this move has caught bearish traders off guard. Ethereum bore the brunt with $29.73 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $23.97 million, highlighting the scale of pain for leveraged shorts across majors. At the same time, the BTC liquidation heatmap suggests that if the price can close and hold above $90,000, there is a thin layer of resistance in the immediate range, with fewer liquidation clusters between $91,000 and $94,000. This opens a clean short-term path for bulls to test higher territory, particularly if spot bids continue to rise and ETF inflows stabilise. On the downside, the chart shows a heavy liquidation build-up just below $88,000, followed by more intense bands near $86,000 and $84,500. This area is also where a new CME futures gap has emerged between roughly $87,800 and $88,000, a zone many traders are now watching closely as a potential downside magnet. CME gaps have a long track record of attracting price action, and with the rally unfolding into the weekend, some expect Bitcoin to drift back toward this region before attempting any sustained move higher next week. Market participants have already flagged this risk, noting that weekend trading conditions often produce choppier price action and additional gaps that can complicate early-week structure. “Good one to keep an eye on in the week ahead,” trading account Daan Crypto Trades wrote on X, adding that with the market heading into the weekend, traders could see a few gaps and a messier chart to start the year. If Bitcoin does revisit the $88,000 area, the dense liquidation clusters below could provide short-term support as shorts are forced to cover and dip buyers step in once again. A deeper pullback toward $86,000 or even $84,500 would likely test broader market conviction, but those zones also align with strong liquidation liquidity that could help cushion downside moves. For now, the near-term outlook hinges on whether bulls can maintain pressure above $90,000. At press time, Bitcoin price was trading at $89,598, holding on to gains of roughly 2% on the day. Top altcoin gainers for the day The altcoin market cap rose 3% to nearly $1.36 trillion earlier in the day before settling at $1.34 trillion at press time. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market cap, rose 3.3% over the day, recovering back above $3,000, and was perched at $3,075 when writing. Other large-cap altcoins such as BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) saw similar gains between 2-3% respectively. Nearly all of the top 100 altcoins in terms of market capitalization were in the green. Sector-wise, the meme coin market saw some of the leading gainers of the day as the total tally of all combined went up 12% over the past 24 hours. Among them were Pepe (PEPE), outpacing the rest with gains of 32%, largely boosted by improved community sentiment after a well-followed trader who previously predicted the memecoin move to billions when it was trading at $600k, made a fresh prediction that it would go up by as much as $69 billion by the end of this year. As Pepe rallied, momentum quickly spilled over into other speculative assets, which are often backed by large cult-like followings that tend to eat into the hype. Floki (FLOKI) and SPX6900 (SPX) caught the slipstream of Pepe’s rally to post gains of over 17%, respectively. Other leading memecoins were also hovering in the green at press time.

The Yearly Dogecoin Chart On the yearly view, Cantonese Cat’s chart frames 2025 as a hold of the 0.786 log Fibonacci support at roughly $0.10879, with the market printing an inside candle into year-end. In that construction, the key takeaway is not momentum but structure: price respected a major retracement line on a log scale and stayed boxed inside the prior year’s range: “DOGE ended 2025 holding 0.786 log fib as support, forming an inside candle, favors bullish continuation,” the analyst writes. The same yearly chart also contextualizes what “continuation” on the yearly view means: the next major reference level is the 1.0 fib line up near $0.73905. That is not being presented as an imminent target, but it does underscore why analysts care about this zone, if the 0.786 level holds on higher timeframes, the chart’s mapped upside is structurally open, even if the path is not linear. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mirrors AMD’s Setup From Last Year, Analyst Claims The Monthly DOGE Chart Matt Hughes aka “The Great Mattsby’s” monthly chart tightens the focus to a single, precise level: the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.11778. Price is shown holding that line while carving out what the chart labels as a higher low, and the analyst is explicit about what that would mean in market-structure terms. “To me, this looks like the higher low needed to start the bottoming process, especially with price holding the 0.382 Fib retracement at 0.11778,” Mattsby wrote, adding that he views the “.11–.12 zone” as compelling on a risk/reward basis. In this framing, the thesis is conditional: the market is not “bullish” because it bounced, it’s constructive because it is attempting to stop making lower lows while defending a defined retracement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario If that $0.11778 level gives way on a monthly basis, the same fib ladder shown on the chart highlights lower references beneath it, including the 0.236 retracement around $0.08433. On the upside, the next retracement markers visible are $0.15428 (0.5) and $0.20210 (0.618), which would be the nearby “prove it” areas if this is, in fact, a basing process rather than a dead-cat bounce. The Weekly Dogecoin Chart Kevin (Kev_Capital_TA) shifts the emphasis to the weekly. Via X, he posted: “Still early but Dogecoin is currently printing a really nice weekly reversal demand candle within a major demand zone.” His conditions are tight and time-bound: “If you can confirm that weekly candle by Sunday close, reclaim the 4HR 200 sma/ema on both Doge and BTC then you could see the low put in for this major correctional phase and the counter trend move higher occuring. All eyes on 88K-91K on BTC.” For Dogecoin traders, the immediate calls are straightforward: Dogecoin needs to keep defending the $0.11–$0.12 area, while the weekly close either validates or negates Kevin’s reversal-candle thesis. If price loses the $0.11778 monthly retracement, the “bottoming” narrative weakens quickly; if it holds and begins reclaiming nearby resistance levels, the charts collectively argue the market may be transitioning from correction to base-building, one confirmed close at a time. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13242.

This is the worst performance for ETH since the 2018 bear market. The past year saw ETH close nine months in the red, its worst losing streak since 2018. Despite the overall positive performance of the Ethereum network, the underlying token lagged, only briefly making a new all-time high. In 2025, ETH did not suffer a big crisis, yet its performance was worse in comparison to 2022, when only seven months ended in the red. ETH crashed despite the lack of a major catastrophic event or bankruptcy in the crypto space, and in the midst of record wallet activity. While the Ethereum ecosystem showed signs of health, including address activity, stablecoin inflows , and DeFi expansion, the ETH token failed to fulfill expectations for a higher price range. ETH lagged in dollar terms despite a climb against BTC In 2025, ETH lost the faith of retail investors and instead became a playground for whales and institutions. ETH whales attempted to achieve a more favorable average price by buying the dip, but the token did not have enough momentum to break out. ETH failed to fulfill the prediction of Bitmine’s Tom Lee for a hike to $7,500 or even $10,000 at the end of the year. The token ended the year with 11.9% in market cap dominance. Over the course of 2025, ETH managed to recover from lows of 0.019 BTC to end the year at 0.034 BTC. Despite this, the token did not fulfill the expectations of expanding to $10,000. The weak ETH performance also coincided with the failure to launch a more lasting altcoin season. The weakness of L2 performance also affected Ethereum, as liquidity left even top networks like Arbitrum. Treasury companies only had a brief effect on the price of ETH. Unlike BTC treasuries, building up ETH reserves was viewed as a means to earn passive income through staking. Even DAT companies did not show conviction in the climb of ETH, but instead on the token’s DeFi and staking ecosystem. ETH recovered the $3,000 range Despite the downturn, ETH managed to recover the $3,000 range. The token mostly traded above the acquisition price of whales at $2,800, bouncing from this support level. The asset ended 2025 with a net loss of 11% after turbulent shifts each quarter. ETH ended 2025 with a net loss of close to 11%, despite the mid-year relief rally. Even with DeFi recovery, ETH had its worst year since 2018. | Source: Coingecko The token had its worst quarterly performance at the start of 2025, losing over 45%. Later, ETH managed to bounce off the mid-year slump and spend several weeks above $4,000. ETH moved to $3,079.92 as of January 2, following a market-wide recovery. The token ended 2025 with a neutral market sentiment, following weeks of relatively subdued derivative trading. Following the October 11 liquidation, ETH open interest declined to a low of $16.2B, recovering to $18B by the end of 2025. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Their cooperation with U.S. authorities on other crypto prosecutions reduced their potential prison time from what could have been decades behind bars for orchestrating one of the largest crypto heists in history. In a video posted to X following the conclusion of their case, Morgan said: “It’s over, and I’m very excited that I will soon be telling my story, sharing my thoughts, and telling you more about the creative and other endeavors I’ve been working on.” My statement #razzlekhan pic.twitter.com/janr9RD1Q2 — Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan (@HeatherReyhan) November 18, 2024 Trump’s Crypto Clemency Wave Draws Political Fire Lichtenstein’s release comes during a broader pattern of leniency toward crypto offenders under Trump’s administration. In March 2025, Trump pardoned BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed, and employee Greg Dwyer, all of whom pleaded guilty in 2022 to Bank Secrecy Act violations for failing to implement anti-money-laundering controls at their crypto derivatives exchange. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao received a presidential pardon in October after pleading guilty to similar violations for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at his exchange, the world’s biggest crypto platform. Trump has also expressed willingness to consider pardoning Keonne Rodriguez, CEO of privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Samourai, who was sentenced to five years for money laundering in December. During an Oval Office event on December 16, Trump told reporters: “I’ve heard about it, I’ll look at it. It sounds like, based on your question, Rodriguez. We’ll look at that, Pam,” addressing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present during the session. California Governor Gavin Newsom has intensified criticism of Trump’s pardon strategy, launching a state-backed website in December tracking what his office calls Trump’s “top criminal cronies.” California Governor Newsom slams Trump’s crypto pardons, calling @binance 's CZ and Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht “criminal cronies” in a new state tracker highlighting controversial pardons. #GavinNewsom #TrumpPardons https://t.co/j9Sac1g4Th — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 The site references Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road’s founder, sentenced to life for narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy involving over $214 million in illegal Bitcoin-facilitated drug sales, alongside newly released crime data showing continued declines across California’s major cities. This series of pardons and appeals has triggered significant political backlash, framing crypto clemency as part of a wider debate over corruption, public safety, and the expanding role of digital assets in American politics.

56738010,651787,1767375008,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Turns Negative, But History Says This Phase Could Be Significant",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharpe-ratio-turns-negative/,bitcoinist,"With Bitcoin ‘s waning price action extending and its value still below the $90,000 mark, many key metrics and indicators are starting to enter into negative territory in this new year. One of the major metrics that has turned negative as the year begins is the BTC Sharpe Ratio, which measures the risk level of the flagship cryptocurrency asset. A Rare Bitcoin Risk-Low Opportunity Has Emerged Ongoing volatility has hampered Bitcoin’s price action despite several attempts at an upward move, keeping the asset stuck below the $100,000 mark. Although the Bitcoin market appears vulnerable at first glance, a closer examination of risk-adjusted returns reveals a more complex picture. Darkfost, a market expert and author at CryptoQuant, has delved into BTC’s risk performance via the Sharpe Ratio, revealing a major shift in the market. According to Darkfost, it is a tool for evaluating risk based on the volatility and returns of an asset. By comparing these two variables, analysts are able to determine periods when exposure is more or less risky. Following his analysis of the Sharpe Ratio, the expert has disclosed that the metric has flipped into a negative territory after falling to -0.5, a move that typically unfolds during periods of market stress or transition. As seen in the chart shared by Darkfost, the metric is now approaching a historical low-risk zone. Typically, when the Sharpe ratio falls to low levels, it is accompanied by high-risk periods. However, this implies that returns have been low for Bitcoin, which is volatile by nature. In other words, investors have experienced a series of losses while volatility stays elevated. This shift may be a sign of weakness in Bitcoin market dynamics. However, it brings Bitcoin closer to areas that have historically been associated with lower downside risk and longer-term opportunities. Darkfost highlighted that the best opportunities on Bitcoin typically appear after losses have already been realized and the correction has been intensified by volatility. The trend leads to significant drawdowns and negative returns. For this reason, a negative Sharpe ratio, such as the current drop to -0.5, may indicate a favorable Bitcoin opportunity. In the past, the best purchasing opportunities have appeared whenever this ratio has reached the extremely low-risk zone indicated on the chart. Are Long-Term Holders Now Buying More BTC? A report from Axel Adler Jr., a researcher and author, shows that Bitcoin long-term holders are demonstrating resilience despite current price fluctuations. Adler’s analysis focuses on the BTC LTH Distribution Pressure metric, which has undergone a key shift that could shape the market’s trajectory. Data tells that the LTH Distribution Pressure Index has fallen to -1.628, which implies that the metric has transitioned into the Accumulation zone. The shift points to minimal selling pressure from BTC’s long-term holders, indicating renewed confidence among the cohort in the asset’s prospects. Currently, the average daily LTH spending for Bitcoin is at 221 BTC, marking one of the lowest levels in months. Darkfost also indicated the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is positioned at 1.13, confirming that BTC holders remain in profit levels. With the key metrics positioned at these critical levels, the market structure seems favorable.",Bitcoin News|Axel Adler Jr|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|LTH Distribution Pressure Index|sopr|Spent Output Profit Ratio,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

While both Bitcoin and Dogecoin remain established assets, the attention is largely centered around the accomplishment of a new player called Mutuum Finance . This initiative has recently seen its V1 lending and borrowing protocol thoroughly examined by Halborn Security. The feedback from the examination has also been incorporated, and the smart contracts have been perfected. As investors take a look at the cryptocurrencies to purchase now in light of genuine readiness and not hype, Mutuum Finance, at the current presale stage of 7, seems to slowly emerge as the best crypto. Bitcoin Remains Stable But Has Limited Potential Bitcoin is currently priced around $88,410 as it ends the year 2025 down 5% and has seen limited price action as trading volume has reduced and sellers continue to unload the asset even at a loss. The realized loss for Bitcoin currently stands at $300 million per day. Though it retains the dominant market, the immediate profit potential for Bitcoin appears to be limited. Thus, for instance, if one chooses to purchase a $5,000 Bitcoin today, it may have to perform a strong breakout to gain only a few hundred dollars. It is for this reason that investors are presently looking to other options when it comes to what to purchase for the next cycle. Dogecoin Remains Pinned By Hype Dogecoin remains very much dependent on market sentiment and trends. Although Dogecoin does make rapid movements during a bullish phase, the cryptocurrency does not have much use value and revenue-generating factors. A Dogecoin investment of $1,500 would require a significant lift in price in order for this cryptocurrency to even double in value, which has traditionally happened when viral hype catches up with a particular cryptocurrency, and not because of its fundamental factors. Mutuum Finance Audit Changes The Narrative The main reason for the rapid popularity of Mutuum Finance lies in the fact that the security review has been completed. Halborn Security has conducted a full audit of the V1 protocol, including the lending and borrowing contracts. The audit has been completed, and the recommendations have been implemented. The team is now working on the timing of the V1 launch, and Mutuum has entered the execution phase. This is an important step for those investors searching for the best cryptocurrency to buy today. Presale Growth And Pricing Mutuum Finance has managed to raise $19,550,000 since the presale began and currently has 18,650 holders. It is currently in Phase 7 at $0.04, which is up 300% from the initial phase price of $0.01. Phase 7 is selling out quickly, and this is the last opportunity to get in at $0.04. An example of the value of getting in early is shown in this scenario. Purchasing $250 worth of tokens at $0.04 will get 6,250 tokens. If demand goes up after the launch, and MUTM hits $0.20, it will be worth $1,250. However, waiting until launch at $0.06 will only buy 4166 tokens and deliver a tiny $583 profit when MUTM touches $0.20 Mutuum Finance is creating a DeFi platform that will allow users to borrow or lend their assets with much ease. The platform will have continuous activity rather than being known for one-time hype. The project has developed a dashboard that displays the top 50 wallets and a 24-hour leaderboard that shows the biggest daily buyers. The top-ranked investor every day will receive a $500 bonus in MUTM every day, as long as there is a transaction before 00:00 UTC, when the cycle resets. As the year 2026 draws near, investors are torn between safety and upside. Bitcoin and Dogecoin provide familiarity but little upside. Mutuum Finance comes with a low barrier to entry, a totally audited V1 protocol, and adequate preparation for the launch. For those individuals wondering which cryptocurrency to invest in before the next rally, Mutuum Finance appears to be a key player among the new players.

(NASDAQ: BMNR) today announced the release of a new Chairman’s message ( link ) outlining why shareholders are being asked to vote YES on a proposal to increase the Company’s authorized shares. The message is now available on the Bitmine website and is intended to provide additional context ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. The voting deadline is January 14, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET. In the video, Chairman Tom Lee explains the rationale behind Proposal 2, which seeks shareholder approval to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. There are three reasons the Company needs to increase authorized shares: It would allow Bitmine to conduct capital markets activities, including at-the-market offerings, convertibles, and warrants. It would provide flexibility to pursue opportunistic deals, including potential mergers or acquisitions. Most importantly, it would enable the Company to implement future stock splits as needed. Since pivoting in July to make Ethereum (ETH) its primary treasury asset, Bitmine has observed that its share price has closely tracked movements in ETH. *Coefficient (per Bloomberg) is 0.015 ETH price plus accretion of ETH/share The scatter chart in the gallery above shows the clear linkage (x-axis is ETH, y-axis is BMNR). The Company believes Ethereum represents the future of finance, a supercycle driven by Wall Street reengineering on the blockchain. Major industry leaders agree, including Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who said that tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum. Previously, Bitmine noted its view that tokenization will drive ETH/BTC to reach all-time highs (0.0873). Targeting 0.25 as Ethereum proves to be the future of finance This implies future ETH prices of: $12k $22k (prior high) $62k (0.25, “payment rails”) $250k (if BTC reaches $1mm) These potential future ETH prices can be used to calculate “implied” future BMNR prices** $22k ETH → $500 BMNR $62.5k ETH → $1,500 BMNR $250k ETH → $5,000 BMNR **These are using the coefficient 0.15* ETH plus assumed accretion ETH/share of 33%. These are for illustrative purposes only. Not a forecast. To keep shares “accessible” to the public, the Company would want to split the shares, to reset the share price back towards $25. If BMNR shares are: $500, needs 20:1 split $1,500, needs 60:1 $5,000 needs 100:1 These splits will increase total shares outstanding. Thus, Bitmine can only split shares in the future if the total authorized shares is increased.
