56715523,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257936,1767326110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surges Past $89,000 Milestone in Major Rally",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-surges-above-89000-4/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surges Past $89,000 Milestone in Major Rally In a significant market movement, the Bitcoin price has surged above the $89,000 threshold, trading at $89,008.28 on the Binance USDT market as of early 2025. This rally marks a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, reflecting renewed institutional confidence and shifting macroeconomic winds. Consequently, analysts are closely examining the drivers behind this ascent. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through Key Psychological Barrier The Bitcoin price crossing $89,000 represents a crucial technical and psychological achievement. Market data from Bitcoin World and other aggregators confirms sustained buying pressure. Historically, such round-number milestones often act as both targets and resistance levels. Therefore, this breakthrough suggests underlying strength in the current market cycle. Several immediate factors contributed to this price action. First, recent regulatory clarity in major economies has reduced uncertainty. Second, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows have shown consistent growth. Finally, broader macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns, are driving asset diversification. For instance, on-chain data reveals substantial accumulation by long-term holders. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Rally Drivers This cryptocurrency rally extends beyond simple speculation. A confluence of fundamental and technical drivers provides context. The adoption of blockchain technology by traditional finance accelerates. Moreover, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues to hit record highs, signaling robust security and miner commitment. The following table outlines key metrics surrounding this price event: Metric Detail Price $89,008.28 Primary Market Binance USDT Pair 24-Hour Volume Significantly Above Average Key Resistance Broken $88,500 – $89,000 Zone Market sentiment, as measured by established fear and greed indices, has shifted from neutral to greedy. However, this does not necessarily indicate an immediate top. Past cycles show sustained rallies can continue despite elevated sentiment readings. The current market structure differs markedly from the 2021 peak, featuring more mature infrastructure. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of institutional participation. Reports from firms like Fidelity and BlackRock highlight growing corporate treasury allocations. This institutional inflow creates a more stable price floor compared to previous retail-driven rallies. Experts point to the volatility compression observed in recent months as a precursor to this breakout. Furthermore, the macroeconomic landscape provides a tailwind. Central bank policies in 2024 and early 2025 have influenced capital flows. As a result, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a digital hedge, similar to gold. This narrative gains strength with each inflationary data release. The asset’s fixed supply stands in stark contrast to expansive monetary policies. Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to $89,000 follows a predictable yet volatile path. The asset has weathered multiple 50%+ drawdowns since its inception. Each recovery has reached new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-term trend. The current price sits within a critical range that could determine the next macro phase. Network Fundamentals: Active addresses and settlement volume remain strong. Miner Health: Revenue is sufficient to support operations post-halving. Regulatory Environment: Clearer frameworks reduce systemic risk. Technological Development: Layer-2 solutions improve utility and scalability. Comparisons to traditional assets are inevitable. Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance often outpaces major indices. This relative strength attracts capital from other asset classes. However, correlations with equities can shift rapidly during risk-off events. Investors must monitor these dynamics closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price achieving a valuation above $89,000 underscores its evolving role in global finance. This milestone results from improved fundamentals, institutional adoption, and a favorable macro climate. While volatility remains inherent, the trend indicates growing maturity for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Market participants will watch for a sustained close above this level to confirm the next leg of the bull market. The Bitcoin price action serves as a key barometer for digital asset health. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to rise above $89,000? A confluence of factors drove the rise, including sustained institutional ETF inflows, positive regulatory developments, and broader macroeconomic conditions encouraging asset diversification. Q2: Is the current Bitcoin price sustainable? While cryptocurrency prices are inherently volatile, analysts note stronger fundamentals now than in previous cycles, including robust network security and growing institutional adoption, which may provide more stability. Q3: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $89,008.28 price represents a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency, surpassing its previous peak achieved in the 2024 cycle. Q4: What are the risks at this price level? Key risks include potential regulatory shifts, macroeconomic downturns affecting risk assets, and profit-taking by short-term holders which could increase selling pressure. Q5: Should investors consider buying Bitcoin at $89,000? Investment decisions should be based on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and thorough research. Many advocates promote a long-term, dollar-cost averaging strategy regardless of price points.

56714826,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257930,1767324611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Market Bottom Remains Elusive, Warns Veteran Bloomberg Analyst",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-market-bottom-bloomberg-analysis/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Market Bottom Remains Elusive, Warns Veteran Bloomberg Analyst In a sobering assessment for cryptocurrency investors, a prominent Bloomberg Intelligence strategist has delivered a stark warning: Bitcoin has not yet reached its market bottom. Mike McGlone, a senior macro strategist with a long track record in commodity and market analysis, presented data suggesting the flagship digital asset may face further declines before establishing a true cyclical low. His analysis, shared in late 2024, hinges on a critical technical metric—the 50-week moving average—and its historical relationship with major market reversals. Understanding the Bitcoin Market Bottom Thesis Mike McGlone’s analysis provides a data-driven perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Currently, Bitcoin trades at approximately a 13% discount to its 50-week moving average. This moving average smooths out price data over the past year, offering a benchmark for the asset’s medium-term trend. However, McGlone points to a concerning historical pattern. Notably, genuine market bottoms in Bitcoin’s volatile history have typically formed when the price plunged to a much steeper discount of around 55% below this key average. This discrepancy between the current 13% discount and the historical 55% benchmark forms the core of his caution. Consequently, the analysis implies that the present price level may not represent the ultimate low for this market cycle. The 50-week moving average itself acts as a dynamic support or resistance level, often reflecting broader market sentiment and institutional positioning. The Role of the 50-Week Moving Average in Crypto Analysis Technical analysts frequently use moving averages to identify trends and potential turning points. The 50-week period is particularly significant because it approximates a full trading year, filtering out short-term noise. When an asset’s price trades significantly below its long-term moving average, it often indicates oversold conditions or a sustained bear trend. For context, during previous major crypto winters, such as the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 periods, Bitcoin’s price did indeed test levels far below this average. McGlone’s reference to a 55% discount is not arbitrary. It is derived from observing past capitulation events where panic selling exhausted itself. Therefore, his statement serves as a quantitative framework rather than mere speculation. It invites market participants to consider the depth of previous corrections. Furthermore, this analysis aligns with a macro perspective, considering factors like liquidity conditions and Federal Reserve policy, which Bloomberg Intelligence regularly monitors. Contextualizing McGlone’s Expertise and Market Impact Mike McGlone brings decades of experience in finance, having analyzed commodities and macro trends before focusing on crypto assets. His reports for Bloomberg Intelligence are widely cited for their data-centric approach. This specific analysis gains weight from his established methodology. The warning arrives amid a complex global economic backdrop, influencing risk assets like Bitcoin. Market reactions to such analyses are often mixed. Some traders view deep discounts as buying opportunities, while others see them as signals for further caution. The key takeaway is the emphasis on historical precedent. The table below illustrates how Bitcoin’s price interacted with its 50-week moving average during notable past bottoms: Period Approx. Price Discount to 50-Wk MA at Bottom Subsequent 12-Month Performance Q1 2019 ~50-60% Significant Recovery Q4 2022 ~40-50% Strong Rally Current Analysis (2024) ~13% To Be Determined This comparative view underscores the analyst’s central argument. Other market experts often monitor similar metrics, including the 200-day moving average and Mayer Multiple. However, the 50-week average provides a distinct, longer-term lens. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The potential for further price discovery lower has implications beyond Bitcoin’s spot price. Firstly, mining economics could face renewed pressure if asset values decline while operational costs remain fixed. Secondly, the broader digital asset market, which often correlates with Bitcoin, may experience continued volatility. Thirdly, institutional adoption timelines could be influenced by prolonged market uncertainty. Nevertheless, it is crucial to frame this analysis within the context of Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and its history of robust recoveries. Past performance never guarantees future results, but it provides essential data. McGlone’s report does not predict an inevitable crash; instead, it highlights a risk parameter based on observable data. Market participants should consider multiple viewpoints and fundamental factors, including: On-chain activity: Metrics like network hash rate and active addresses. Regulatory developments: Clarity from major global jurisdictions. Macroeconomic factors: Interest rate trajectories and inflation data. Adoption catalysts: Such as spot ETF flows and institutional integration. Ultimately, analyses like McGlone’s contribute to a more informed market dialogue. They emphasize risk management and historical awareness over short-term sentiment. Conclusion Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone’s assessment presents a cautious, data-heavy perspective on the search for the Bitcoin market bottom. By comparing the current 13% discount to the 50-week moving average against historical norms near 55%, the analysis suggests the market may not have seen its lowest point yet. This viewpoint, grounded in technical analysis and historical precedent, serves as a critical reminder of the asset’s volatility. While not a definitive forecast, it underscores the importance of rigorous analysis and measured expectations for investors navigating the complex cryptocurrency landscape. The path to the next Bitcoin market bottom, therefore, remains a key focus for analysts and traders alike. FAQs Q1: What is a 50-week moving average? A 50-week moving average is a technical analysis tool that calculates the average closing price of an asset over the past 50 weeks. It smooths out short-term price fluctuations to reveal the underlying longer-term trend. Q2: Why does Mike McGlone believe a 55% discount signals a market bottom? His belief is based on historical observation. In previous major Bitcoin bear markets, the price has often found a durable bottom after falling approximately 55% below its 50-week moving average, indicating a point of maximum pessimism and selling exhaustion. Q3: Does this analysis mean Bitcoin’s price will definitely fall further? No. The analysis identifies a risk parameter based on history. It is not a certainty. Market conditions are unique each cycle, and new factors like institutional adoption can influence price action differently than in the past. Q4: How should a long-term investor interpret this warning? A long-term investor might view it as a reminder of Bitcoin’s volatility and a framework for understanding risk. It could inform dollar-cost averaging strategies or prompt a review of portfolio allocation, but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Q5: Are other analysts using similar metrics to predict a Bitcoin market bottom? Yes. Many technical analysts monitor moving averages, including the 50-week and 200-day. Other metrics like the Mayer Multiple, stock-to-flow models, and on-chain realized price are also used to assess market cycles and potential bottoms.

56714729,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257931,1767324311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: Short Positions Dominate $19M in a Stunning 24-Hour Squeeze,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-short-position-liquidations-squeeze/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: Short Positions Dominate $19M in a Stunning 24-Hour Squeeze Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant derivatives shakeout on March 21, 2025, as leveraged short positions faced a brutal squeeze, resulting in over $38 million in total liquidations across major assets. The spotlight, however, fell squarely on Bitcoin, where a staggering $18.99 million was forcibly closed, with short sellers bearing 84.56% of the pain. This event highlights the intense volatility and high-stakes nature of the perpetual futures market, where rapid price movements can trigger cascading effects for over-leveraged traders. Bitcoin Liquidations Lead a Market-Wide Squeeze The data from the past 24 hours paints a clear picture of a market moving sharply against bearish bets. Perpetual futures, which are derivative contracts without an expiry date, use a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot market. When prices rise rapidly, traders who have borrowed assets to sell (shorting) face mounting losses. Consequently, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent negative balances, a process known as liquidation. In this instance, Bitcoin’s price action triggered a cascade. The dominance of short-side liquidations at 84.56% strongly suggests a swift upward price movement caught a large cohort of traders off guard. This phenomenon, often called a ‘short squeeze,’ forces sellers to buy back the asset to close their positions, which can ironically fuel further price increases in the short term. Market analysts frequently monitor liquidation clusters as they can indicate local tops or bottoms and signal excessive leverage in the system. Ethereum and RIVER Follow the Volatile Trend While Bitcoin led the liquidation volume, other major cryptocurrencies experienced similar pressure. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, saw $10.55 million in positions liquidated. Notably, short positions comprised 66.7% of this total, indicating a correlated but less extreme squeeze compared to Bitcoin. The lower percentage suggests a more balanced mix of long and short positions were wiped out during ETH’s price movements. The data for RIVER, a prominent altcoin, further underscores the market-wide nature of the event. With $9.27 million liquidated and shorts making up 77.43% of the total, it followed the pattern set by Bitcoin. This synchronicity often points to a macro-level catalyst or a surge in overall market sentiment that impacts correlated assets. The following table summarizes the key liquidation data: Asset Total Liquidations Short Position % Long Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $18.99M 84.56% 15.44% Ethereum (ETH) $10.55M 66.70% 33.30% RIVER $9.27M 77.43% 22.57% This data, sourced from aggregated cryptocurrency derivatives tracking platforms, provides a snapshot of extreme market stress. Importantly, these figures represent only a portion of the global derivatives market, as they are compiled from major centralized exchanges that publicly report such data. Expert Analysis on Derivatives Market Mechanics According to common analysis from derivatives trading desks, events like these serve as a critical reminder of market mechanics. The high funding rates that often precede such squeezes make it expensive to hold short positions, creating a precarious setup. When the price finally breaks upward, the resulting liquidations act as a forced buying mechanism. Seasoned traders monitor metrics like the estimated leverage ratio and open interest to gauge market vulnerability. Historically, large-scale liquidation events have preceded both sustained trends and sharp reversals. For instance, the market downturn of 2022 was punctuated by several record-breaking liquidation days that accelerated downward momentum. Conversely, the bullish cycle of 2024 saw multiple short squeezes that propelled prices higher as stop-loss orders were triggered. The current event’s context within broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate expectations or institutional adoption flows, is essential for understanding its potential longer-term impact. The Ripple Effects of a Major Squeeze The immediate effect of such liquidations is a rapid reduction in market leverage and open interest. This can temporarily reduce volatility as overextended positions are cleared. However, the forced buying from short liquidations provides potent, albeit artificial, upward pressure on the spot price. Furthermore, these events often lead to increased volatility in the options market, as implied volatility spikes due to the sudden and dramatic price action. For the broader ecosystem, large liquidations highlight several key points: Risk Management Importance: They underscore the critical need for prudent leverage and stop-loss strategies. Market Sentiment Gauge: The skew toward short liquidations often reflects a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment, at least temporarily. Infrastructure Stress Test: Exchanges must handle the high volume of forced trades without system issues, testing their operational resilience. Ultimately, while dramatic, single-day liquidation events are a normal function of a mature, liquid derivatives market. They represent the transfer of capital from incorrect bets to those on the right side of the move, contributing to price discovery. Conclusion The 24-hour period ending March 21, 2025, delivered a powerful lesson in cryptocurrency market dynamics, with Bitcoin liquidations dominating headlines. The overwhelming dominance of short position liquidations, particularly for BTC, signals a pronounced squeeze that realigned leveraged positions with a shifting market reality. These events, while volatile, are integral to the derivatives landscape, serving to flush out excessive leverage and realign prices. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this liquidation flush establishes a new support level or merely punctuates a short-term correction, as the search for the next directional catalyst begins. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when short positions are liquidated? A1: Short position liquidation occurs when a trader who has borrowed and sold an asset, betting on a price decrease, is forced to buy it back at a higher price to close the position. This happens automatically by the exchange when the trader’s losses exceed their collateral, preventing a negative account balance. Q2: Why is a high percentage of short liquidations significant? A2: A high percentage, like Bitcoin’s 84.56%, strongly indicates a ‘short squeeze.’ This means the price moved up sharply, forcing many bearish traders out of their positions simultaneously. Their forced buying can create additional upward momentum in the price. Q3: Where does liquidation data come from? A3: Liquidation data is aggregated and reported by analytics platforms that track activity on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Binance, Bybit, OKX). The data is a sample of the total market but is considered a reliable indicator of trends and extremes. Q4: How do liquidations affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A4: For spot investors not using leverage, the main impact is increased price volatility. Large liquidations can cause sharp, temporary price spikes or dips. They also signal where large clusters of stop-loss orders may be located, which technical analysts monitor. Q5: Are large liquidations a bearish or bullish signal? A5: It depends on the context. A squeeze of short positions (like this event) is immediately bullish as it involves forced buying. However, it can also indicate that excessive bullish leverage has built up, potentially setting the stage for a long liquidation event if the price reverses. Analysts view it as a sign of a market clearing excess, not a definitive long-term directional indicator.

This figure, far from the threshold signaling a broad altcoin rally, provides a data-driven snapshot of a market still firmly under Bitcoin’s influence. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing historical patterns and on-chain metrics to understand the potential trajectory for alternative cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Market Barometer The Altcoin Season Index serves as a quantitative pulse check for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Specifically, CoinMarketCap’s algorithm analyzes the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, deliberately excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. It then meticulously compares each asset’s gains or losses against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The resulting score is a clear percentage: the proportion of these top altcoins that have outperformed the pioneer cryptocurrency. Therefore, a score of 75 or above formally declares an “altcoin season,” a period where investor capital rotates aggressively into smaller, riskier assets. Conversely, a score like the current 21 underscores a “Bitcoin season,” where capital preservation and focus on the market leader prevail. The Mechanics Behind the Metric Understanding the index requires a grasp of its construction. The 90-day window smooths out short-term volatility and captures medium-term trends, offering a more stable view than weekly or monthly comparisons. By focusing on the top 100 assets by market capitalization, the index prioritizes projects with significant liquidity and investor interest, avoiding noise from micro-cap tokens. The exclusion of stablecoins, which are designed to maintain parity with fiat, and wrapped tokens, which represent other assets on a different blockchain, ensures the metric purely measures speculative performance against Bitcoin. This methodological rigor makes the index a trusted tool for both retail and institutional analysts tracking market cycle phases. Historical Context and the Current Crypto Climate The index’s current reading of 21 is not an anomaly but fits within observable crypto market cycles. Historically, prolonged Bitcoin seasons often precede explosive altcoin rallies. For instance, the bull run of late 2020 saw the index languish in Bitcoin-dominant territory before catapulting above 75 for an extended period in early 2021. Presently, several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors contribute to the subdued index reading. Firstly, institutional adoption continues to favor Bitcoin through spot ETF products and corporate treasuries. Secondly, regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions often arrives first for Bitcoin, creating a “safe-haven” effect within the volatile crypto space. Finally, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 historically catalyzes a market-wide focus on its supply dynamics, often sidelining altcoins in the immediate aftermath. Key factors influencing the current low Altcoin Season Index: Institutional Capital Inflows: Major investment vehicles are predominantly Bitcoin-centric. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of economic stress, investors often flock to perceived stores of value. Network Activity: Bitcoin’s hash rate and security budget remain at all-time highs, reinforcing its foundational status. Developer Activity: While vibrant in ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana, capital has been slow to follow innovation recently. Expert Analysis and Market Impact Market strategists interpret the index through different lenses. Some view a low reading as a consolidation phase, where altcoins build fundamental strength before their next leg up. Others see it as a warning sign of reduced risk appetite among crypto investors. The direct impact is observable in trading volumes and capital rotation. Exchange data shows a higher ratio of Bitcoin-to-stablecoin trading pairs compared to altcoin pairs. Furthermore, funding rates in altcoin perpetual futures markets are generally neutral or negative, indicating a lack of aggressive bullish leverage. This environment, however, can create opportunities for disciplined investors to accumulate fundamentally strong altcoins at relatively depressed valuations compared to Bitcoin, a strategy often called “altcoin accumulation.” The Road Ahead: Signals to Watch A sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index toward the 75 threshold would likely require a confluence of events. Bitcoin achieving a new all-time high and stabilizing is frequently a precursor, as it boosts overall market confidence. Subsequently, narratives around decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), non-fungible token (NFT) volume resurgence, or breakthroughs in blockchain scalability could trigger rotational moves. On-chain metrics like the Bitcoin Dominance chart and the supply of altcoins on exchanges versus in long-term storage provide complementary data. Ultimately, the index is a lagging indicator, confirming a trend already in motion. Savvy observers monitor social sentiment, developer commits, and protocol revenue to anticipate shifts before they appear in the 90-day performance data. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index, standing firmly at 21, delivers an unambiguous message about the present state of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin retains its dominant position, with the majority of major alternative cryptocurrencies failing to outpace its performance over the last quarter. This phase, while potentially frustrating for altcoin enthusiasts, is a well-documented chapter in the volatile history of digital assets. It emphasizes the importance of understanding market cycles, employing robust risk management, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price action. As the market evolves, this index will remain a crucial tool for gauging when investor psychology and capital flows might pivot, heralding the next potential altcoin season. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 21 mean? An index score of 21 means that only 21% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This indicates a strong “Bitcoin season” where the pioneer cryptocurrency is leading the market. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates it by comparing the 90-day price performance of each of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The percentage of altcoins that outperform Bitcoin becomes the index score. Q3: Why are stablecoins and wrapped tokens excluded from the index? Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies and designed not to fluctuate, while wrapped tokens represent another asset (like Bitcoin on Ethereum). Excluding them ensures the index measures pure, speculative performance of alternative assets against Bitcoin. Q4: Can the Altcoin Season Index predict future price movements? The index is a lagging indicator, reflecting what has already happened over 90 days. It doesn’t predict the future but helps identify which phase of the market cycle (Bitcoin or altcoin dominance) the market is currently in, which can inform strategy. Q5: What typically triggers a shift from a low index to an altcoin season? Shifts often follow Bitcoin establishing new price stability at higher levels, combined with emerging strong narratives in other sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or GameFi, leading investors to seek higher returns in altcoins.

According to definitive data from the leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, this significant expiry event will occur at 08:00 UTC, potentially creating substantial volatility and influencing short-term price trajectories for the world’s premier digital asset. Simultaneously, Ethereum options worth $390 million will reach their expiry, compounding the market’s focus on derivatives activity. This confluence of events represents one of the first major financial tests for digital assets in the new year, drawing intense scrutiny from institutional traders and retail investors alike. Decoding the $1.85 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry The sheer scale of today’s Bitcoin options expiry demands a thorough examination of its core mechanics. The notional value, representing the total worth of the underlying Bitcoin tied to these contracts, underscores the growing institutional footprint in crypto derivatives. Crucially, the put/call ratio for this batch sits at 0.48. This key metric, calculated by dividing put option volume by call option volume, indicates a market sentiment leaning bullish. Specifically, a ratio below 1.0 suggests traders have opened more call options (bets on price increases) than put options (bets on decreases). Consequently, this skew can influence market maker hedging behavior in the hours surrounding expiry. Furthermore, analysts immediately highlight the max pain price of $88,000. This theoretical price point is where the largest number of these Bitcoin options contracts would expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option buyers and maximum gain for option sellers. Market makers, who often hedge their positions, may engage in trading activity to pin the spot price near this level as expiry approaches. However, it is vital to understand that max pain is a snapshot, not a deterministic force. External market factors, including macroeconomic news or substantial spot market flows, can easily override its influence. Asset Notional Expiry Value Put/Call Ratio Max Pain Price Bitcoin (BTC) $1.85 Billion 0.48 $88,000 Ethereum (ETH) $390 Million 0.62 $2,950 Ethereum’s Substantial $390 Million Companion Expiry While Bitcoin commands the headline, the concurrent expiry of $390 million in Ethereum options adds a critical layer of complexity to the market event. Ethereum’s put/call ratio of 0.62, while still below 1.0, is notably higher than Bitcoin’s. This suggests a slightly more cautious or hedged sentiment among Ethereum options traders. The max pain price for ETH is set at $2,950, providing a clear focal point for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The interaction between Bitcoin and Ethereum volatility during this period is a key watchpoint for analysts. Historically, large expiries can lead to correlated price movements, but divergences often occur based on asset-specific narratives and liquidity profiles. Deribit continues to dominate the crypto options landscape, consistently processing over 85% of global volume. The exchange’s data is therefore considered the authoritative source for such expiry events. The reliability of this data allows traders to make informed decisions. Additionally, the structure of these options—primarily European-style, which can only be exercised at expiry—reduces the risk of early assignment and concentrates the market impact around the settlement time. Historical Context and Market Impact Analysis To fully grasp the potential outcomes, one must consider historical precedents. Large quarterly and monthly options expiries have become regular features of the crypto market cycle. Past events have demonstrated a range of effects: Volatility Suppression: Sometimes, the dominant force is gamma hedging by market makers. If they are short gamma near expiry, they may buy or sell spot assets to remain delta-neutral, potentially damping volatility. Pin Risk to Max Pain: On other occasions, especially in lower-liquidity environments, the spot price exhibits a “pinning” effect, gravitating toward the max pain price as expiry nears. Post-Expiry Breakouts: Often, the most significant price movement occurs *after* the expiry settles. The removal of large hedging overhead can unleash pent-up momentum, leading to decisive breaks above or below key technical levels. The current macroeconomic backdrop, including interest rate expectations and traditional equity market performance, will also play a decisive role in how spot prices absorb the expiry’s mechanical effects. Traders monitor the options open interest term structure to gauge where future pressure points may lie. Expert Insights on Derivatives Market Maturity The consistent growth in notional expiry values, from hundreds of millions to multiple billions, signals the profound maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives markets. This growth reflects increased participation from regulated entities, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. These players use options not purely for speculation, but for sophisticated strategies like portfolio insurance, yield enhancement, and directional hedging. The depth of this market now provides valuable sentiment indicators. For instance, the skew of options prices across different strike prices can reveal where professional traders see support and resistance levels. Moreover, the evolution of products like volatility derivatives and the increasing correlation between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) metrics mean that events like today’s expiry are no longer isolated. They are integrated into global risk-on/risk-off calculus. Analysts from major financial institutions now routinely publish research on crypto options flows, treating them with a analytical framework similar to that used for equities or commodities. Conclusion The expiry of $1.85 billion in Bitcoin options and $390 million in Ethereum options today represents a significant, data-rich event for cryptocurrency markets. While the max pain prices of $88,000 for BTC and $2,950 for ETH provide focal points, market participants should view them as one of many factors in a complex ecosystem. The bullish-leaning put/call ratios, particularly for Bitcoin, offer a snapshot of prevailing sentiment heading into the new year. Ultimately, the true impact will be determined by the interplay of derivatives mechanics, spot market liquidity, and broader financial conditions. This Bitcoin options expiry underscores the crypto market’s continued financialization and its growing interconnectedness with global capital flows, making such events essential reading for any serious market observer. FAQs Q1: What does a “put/call ratio” of 0.48 mean for Bitcoin? A1: A put/call ratio of 0.48 means there are roughly twice as many call options (bullish bets) as put options (bearish bets) set to expire. This typically indicates a bullish sentiment among the options traders for this expiry cycle. Q2: What is “max pain price” and does it guarantee the price will go there? A2: Max pain price is the strike price at which the total financial loss for all options buyers is maximized (and gain for sellers is maximized). It is a theoretical calculation, not a guarantee. While market maker hedging can sometimes influence price toward it, spot market forces often prevail. Q3: How does a large options expiry actually affect Bitcoin’s spot price? A3: The effect is primarily indirect via market maker hedging. To manage their risk (delta/gamma), market makers buy or sell Bitcoin in the spot market. This activity can create support, resistance, or volatility suppression in the hours before expiry, with potential for a release of momentum afterward. Q4: Why is Deribit’s data so important for these events? A4: Deribit is the world’s largest cryptocurrency options exchange by volume, consistently handling over 85% of global trading. Its data on open interest, put/call ratios, and max pain is therefore considered the most comprehensive and authoritative benchmark for the market. Q5: Are Ethereum options expiries as significant as Bitcoin’s? A5: While smaller in notional value, a $390 million Ethereum expiry is still highly significant. It can drive volatility for ETH and, given the correlation between assets, can influence the broader altcoin market. The different put/call ratio (0.62 for ETH vs. 0.48 for BTC) also provides a nuanced view of relative sentiment between the two major assets.

This measurable change, reported on April 9, 2025, by data provider Alternative, signals a potential inflection point for digital asset traders worldwide who closely watch this barometer for clues about market bottoms and prevailing emotional trends. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Rise to 28 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial quantitative gauge for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it translates complex market data into a simple sentiment score. A reading of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ often associated with panic selling and potential buying opportunities, while 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed,’ which can signal market tops and excessive speculation. The recent jump from 20 to 28 represents a significant 40% increase in the score, marking the most substantial single-day gain in several weeks. This movement away from the extreme fear threshold (typically below 25) suggests a moderation in panic, though the market remains firmly in negative sentiment territory. Historically, sustained periods in the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49) have preceded consolidations and gradual recoveries, making the current level a critical one for analysts to watch. The Multifactor Engine Behind the Sentiment Score Unlike a simple poll, the index employs a sophisticated, weighted model that aggregates data from six distinct sources to minimize bias. This methodology ensures the score reflects actual market behavior and organic interest rather than mere opinion. The calculation breaks down as follows: Volatility (25%): This component analyzes the magnitude of recent price swings, particularly for Bitcoin. High volatility often correlates with fear, while low volatility can indicate complacency or greed. Market Volume & Momentum (25%): The model assesses trading volume and current price momentum across major spot markets. Unusually high volume during downturns can amplify fear readings. Social Media (15%): Data miners scan platforms like Twitter and Reddit for the volume and sentiment of cryptocurrency mentions. A surge in negative commentary weighs the index down. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the retail and professional investor community provide a direct sentiment check, though this is the most subjective input. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is a key metric. Rising dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful periods, as investors abandon altcoins for Bitcoin. Trends & Search Volume (10%): Google Trends data for core cryptocurrency search terms indicates retail interest. Spiking searches for ‘Bitcoin crash’ directly contribute to fear. The eight-point gain likely stemmed from improvements across several metrics, potentially including reduced volatility, a stabilization in trading volume, and a slight uptick in positive social media discourse following recent regulatory clarifications in key jurisdictions. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis To understand the significance of a ’28’ reading, one must examine historical patterns. The index famously plunged to a record low of ‘6’ during the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020, a moment that preceded a historic bull run. Conversely, it reached ’95’ during the peak euphoria of November 2021, just before a major market correction. The table below illustrates key sentiment levels and their typical market implications: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Phase Investor Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear Capitulation / Potential Bottom Panic selling, high stress 25-49 Fear Bear Market / Accumulation Cautious, selective buying 50-74 Greed Bull Market / Growth FOMO, increasing leverage 75-100 Extreme Greed Market Top / Bubble Irrational exuberance Currently, the index resides in the lower ‘Fear’ bracket. Market technicians often view a climb out of ‘Extreme Fear’ as a necessary first step for any sustainable recovery, as it indicates the most intense selling pressure may be exhausting itself. However, veteran analysts consistently warn that the index is a contrarian indicator; extreme readings often signal a coming reversal. Therefore, a rise from ‘Extreme Fear’ is watched closely but not interpreted as an immediate all-clear signal. Broader Market Impacts and On-Chain Correlations The shift in the Fear & Greed Index rarely occurs in a vacuum. It frequently correlates with observable on-chain data from blockchain analytics firms. For instance, a move out of extreme fear often coincides with a decrease in the volume of Bitcoin moving to exchange wallets (a sign of reduced intent to sell) and an increase in the number of ‘accumulation addresses’ (wallets with only incoming transactions). Furthermore, the options market shows changing dynamics; the put/call ratio for Bitcoin options may decline as the fear index rises, indicating reduced demand for downside protection. This sentiment shift also impacts altcoins. Typically, when fear recedes slightly, capital begins to rotate tentatively from Bitcoin into major large-cap altcoins, which often exhibit higher beta (volatility) relative to Bitcoin’s movements. The recent index change may therefore presage a period of reduced correlation across crypto assets, allowing fundamental projects to differentiate themselves. The Regulatory and Macroeconomic Backdrop Market sentiment does not evolve independently of the global financial landscape. The index’s recent improvement occurs against a complex backdrop of evolving central bank policies, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory advancements for digital assets. Clearer guidance from legislative bodies in the United States and Europe regarding cryptocurrency custody and classification can directly reduce market uncertainty, a key driver of fear. Similarly, macroeconomic factors like inflation data and interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve heavily influence risk asset appetite, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts note that a stabilizing macro environment often provides the foundation for sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index to recover, as it reduces a major source of systemic risk for the asset class. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 28 marks a meaningful, though preliminary, shift in cryptocurrency market psychology. This transition from ‘extreme fear’ to ‘fear’ reflects a measurable cooling of panic across multiple data-driven dimensions, including volatility, social sentiment, and market momentum. While firmly indicating that investor caution still dominates, the move suggests the market may be entering a phase of accumulation and consolidation after a prolonged period of distress. For investors, this index level serves as a critical data point, emphasizing the importance of disciplined, long-term strategy over emotional reaction. As always, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a valuable snapshot of the market’s emotional temperature, reminding participants that the collective mood swings between fear and greed are a permanent feature of the financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 28 mean? A1: A score of 28 places market sentiment in the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49). It indicates that negative emotions like anxiety and caution are dominant among investors, but the intense panic associated with ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 25) has subsided. This level often corresponds with periods of price stabilization and potential accumulation by long-term investors. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A2: The index is updated daily, typically once per 24-hour period. The data provider, Alternative, aggregates the latest metrics for volatility, volume, social media, surveys, dominance, and search trends to calculate a new score each day, reflecting the most recent shifts in market sentiment. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? A3: The index is best used as a contrarian sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. Historically, ‘Extreme Fear’ levels have often coincided with market bottoms and buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ has signaled potential tops. However, it should never be used in isolation and must be combined with fundamental and technical analysis for informed decision-making. Q4: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? A4: While Bitcoin’s price, volatility, and dominance are heavily weighted inputs, the index aims to measure sentiment for the broader cryptocurrency market. Factors like social media mentions and surveys encompass major altcoins. Bitcoin’s outsized influence on the overall market means its performance significantly drives the final score. Q5: Has the index ever been wrong? A5: As a sentiment indicator, it reflects current emotions, not future price predictions. It can remain in ‘Extreme Fear’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ for extended periods during prolonged bear or bull markets. Its primary value lies in identifying emotional extremes that have, in the past, preceded market reversals, but timing those reversals based solely on the index is highly unreliable.

Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Been Declining Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno has talked about Bitcoin cycles from a different lens. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” noted Moreno. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case The analyst has gauged the “demand” for the cryptocurrency using the Apparent Demand indicator, which compares the daily miner issuance against the changes in the 1-year dormant supply. The first of these, the miner issuance, is the amount that miners are “minting” on the network every day by receiving block rewards. This metric essentially reflects the “production” of the asset. The 1-year inactive supply, on the other hand, can be thought of as the cryptocurrency’s “inventory.” Thus, the Apparent Demand basically compares the production of Bitcoin against changes taking place in its inventory. Below is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trends in the 30-day and 1-year versions of the Apparent Demand over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the last few Bitcoin cycles have all transitioned into a bear market when the Apparent Demand has plunged into the negative region on both the monthly and yearly timeframes. In the current cycle, the 30-day Apparent Demand has plunged into the red zone recently, suggesting that the monthly demand for the asset has been negative. On the annual scale, the metric is still at a positive level, but its value has been following a downtrend. If this decline keeps up, it won’t be long before the indicator has dipped into the negative territory. Considering the pattern from the previous cycles, the current structure in the Apparent Demand is certainly looking bearish. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the yearly version of the metric will cross into the red zone or if it will rebound, signaling the return of demand. Spot demand isn’t the only way to measure Bitcoin demand these days. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been some fresh off-chain demand coming into the cryptocurrency this cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium At Rare Discount As US Demand Weakens As on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about in an X post, the 30-day netflow related to the US BTC spot ETFs has remained in the negative zone recently, indicating demand has been muted in this side of the market as well.

Despite the pullback, the market has managed to hold above the $3 trillion level. At the same time, total crypto trading volume over the past day is approximately $87.6 billion. TLDRs: The crypto market cap slipped 0.8% over the past 24 hours to about $3.06 trillion; Most large-cap coins traded lower, though losses were modest across the top 10; Crypto sentiment remains cautious, with the Fear and Greed Index at 31 in the fear zone; US BTC spot ETFs recorded $348.1 million in net outflows on Dec. 31; US ETH spot ETFs also saw outflows of $72.1 million; Analysts expect Bitcoin gains in 2026 to be steadier, supported by easing Fed liquidity but tempered by high rates; BTC is consolidating between roughly $85,000 and $88,000, with key support near $80,000 and resistance above $92,000; ETH is stabilising above $2,900, with recovery possible above $3,100 and downside risk below $2,800; A US federal judge dismissed a crypto investor lawsuit against Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks. Crypto Winners and Losers At the time of writing, price action among the top assets is mixed, though the majority of large-cap coins are trading in the red on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin (BTC) is down about 1.2% over the past 24 hours, trading near $87,735. Ethereum (ETH) is showing relative strength compared with the broader market, slipping just 0.1% to around $2,981, making it one of the smallest decliners among the top 10. Solana (SOL) has fallen roughly 1% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $124.87, while BNB is down close to 0.9% to $859.65. XRP (XRP) has also declined by about 1%, changing hands at $1.85. Dogecoin (DOGE) is among the weaker performers in the top 10, sliding around 2.1% to $0.1205. Tron (TRX) stands out for its relative resilience, posting a 0.7% gain over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.2849, making it one of the few large-cap assets in positive territory. Outside the majors, some smaller tokens are seeing sharp moves. Bitlight is leading the gainers with a surge of more than 120%, while Collect on Fanable and Everlyn have also posted strong double-digit gains. On the downside, Lighter is the biggest loser among trending tokens, dropping more than 8% on the day. Meanwhile, several of the crypto industry’s most prominent figures saw their personal fortunes shrink sharply in 2025, as a violent market reversal in October wiped out gains accumulated earlier in the year. Several prominent crypto figures saw their personal fortunes shrink sharply in 2025, as a violent market reversal in October wiped out gains. #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/DwSrRA8Cfj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2026 Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, lost $2.6 billion over the past 12 months, reducing his net worth to $3.8 billion. Fed Liquidity and Lower Rates Could Support Bitcoin Gains in 2026 Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing U.S. monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into markets, according to Abra CEO Bill Barhydt. He said early signs of renewed Federal Reserve bond buying and falling interest rates, which he described as “quantitative easing light,” are typically supportive for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Beyond liquidity, Barhydt pointed to clearer U.S. regulation and growing institutional participation as longer-term tailwinds. However, near-term expectations remain cautious, with CME data showing limited confidence in an early 2026 rate cut, suggesting that supportive conditions may take time to fully materialize. Analysts broadly expect gains to be steadier rather than explosive. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees a long-term upward grind with lower volatility, while analyst Linh Tran said Bitcoin’s recent pullback reflects a shift toward fundamentals, macro conditions, and institutional flows. With rates still high and ETF inflows uneven, Bitcoin may remain in an accumulation phase early in 2026 rather than entering a sharp rally. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $87,789, showing a modest daily gain after stabilising toward the end of December. The chart shows that BTC previously fell sharply from October highs near $126,000 before finding support in the $85,000–$88,000 range, where price action has since compressed into a tighter band. Over the past several weeks, Bitcoin has largely moved sideways, suggesting a consolidation phase following the steep correction. If downside pressure returns, a break below the $85,000 area could expose BTC to further losses toward the $81,000–$80,000 zone, which stands out as the next major support. On the upside, a sustained move above $92,000 would be an early signal of renewed momentum, potentially opening the door toward $98,000 and higher resistance levels near $103,000. Ethereum is currently changing hands around $2,984, slightly outperforming Bitcoin on the day. The chart shows ETH declining steadily from September highs above $4,600 before forming a base near the $2,800–$2,900 region. Recent price action suggests ETH is attempting to stabilise after repeated tests of this support zone. In the near term, holding above $2,900 keeps Ethereum in a neutral-to-stable posture. A close above the $3,100–$3,200 range could signal a recovery phase, with potential upside targets near $3,400 and $3,600. Conversely, a drop below $2,800 would weaken the structure and could push ETH toward the next support around $2,600, where buyers previously stepped in during November’s sell-off. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains cautious as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 31, keeping the market firmly in the fear zone. The reading shows little change from recent sessions, signaling continued uncertainty among investors, with traders largely waiting for clearer macroeconomic or policy signals before taking on additional risk. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs closed the final trading day of 2025 in the red, with data showing net outflows of $348.1 million on Dec. 31, according to SoSoValue. The decline came despite the market remaining active, with total daily trading volume reaching $2.83 billion. Outflows were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $99.05 million leave the fund, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $46.58 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also continued to bleed assets, recording $69.09 million in outflows, while Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB posted $76.53 million in net redemptions. Despite the daily pullback, cumulative net inflows across U.S. BTC spot ETFs remain strong at $56.61 billion. Total net assets across the products stand at $113.29 billion, representing about 6.47% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs also ended the year under pressure, posting net outflows of $72.06 million on Dec. 31. Trading activity remained moderate, with $808.1 million in total value traded during the session. BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, seeing $21.51 million leave the fund, while Grayscale’s ETH product recorded $31.98 million in net redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH also posted smaller outflows of $2.22 million, reflecting broad-based caution across issuers. Cumulative net inflows into US ETH spot ETFs remain positive at $12.33 billion. Total net assets stand at $17.95 billion, accounting for roughly 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, a U.S. federal judge threw out a crypto investor lawsuit against Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks, ending a case that tried to pin Voyager Digital’s collapse on celebrity-style promotion and team marketing. A US judge dismissed a crypto investor lawsuit against Mark Cuban @mcuban and the Dallas Mavericks, ruling the Florida court lacked jurisdiction over Voyager promotion claims. #MarkCuban #Voyager https://t.co/2NP2ZLRQoj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 1, 2026 Judge Roy K. Altman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida said in an order dated Friday that the plaintiffs failed to establish personal jurisdiction over Cuban and the team, and the court lacked a sufficient connection between Florida and the alleged promotion.

Key Takeaways: Fed bond buying and lower rates could support Bitcoin in 2026. Clearer regulation and institutional demand remain long-term tailwinds. Gains are likely to be steadier, with fewer sharp rallies. Speaking on Schwab Network , Barhydt said the U.S. central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt. Fed Bond Buying, Falling Rates Could Lift Bitcoin in 2026 “We are seeing the Fed start to buy its own bonds,” Barhydt said. “Next year, demand for government debt is likely to fall alongside lower interest rates. That combination tends to be positive for all assets, including Bitcoin.” Beyond liquidity, Barhydt brought up regulatory clarity in the U.S. and rising institutional participation as tailwinds that could extend Bitcoin’s upside beyond a single cycle. In his view, lower rates paired with clearer rules could set the stage for several strong years across the digital asset market. Market expectations, however, suggest policymakers remain cautious in the near term. Data from the CME Group shows that just 14.9% of traders expect an interest rate cut at the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting, down from 23% in November, indicating that rate relief may take time to materialize. Last week, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan also said Bitcoin is likely to deliver steady gains over the next decade, but investors should not expect the kind of explosive year-on-year rallies seen in earlier cycles. Hougan described Bitcoin’s outlook as a prolonged upward trend marked by lower volatility and more measured returns. “I think we’re in a 10-year grind upward of strong returns,” he said. “It’s not spectacular returns, [but] strong returns, lower volatility, some up and down.” Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Meanwhile, analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. As a result, the outlook for Q1 2026 depends more on fundamentals than cyclical hype. High interest rates remain a key constraint. With U.S. rates still in the 3.5%–3.75% range and expectations for easing pushed into the second half of 2026, liquidity conditions are unlikely to support a strong rally in early 2026. “When liquidity conditions have not yet improved materially, Bitcoin is unlikely to enter a strong growth phase driven purely by macro factors. Instead, the current monetary environment may keep the cryptocurrency trading in a cautious and stable manner,” Tran said. While spot Bitcoin ETFs hold more than $110 billion in assets, flows have become uneven, suggesting institutions are reallocating selectively rather than aggressively increasing exposure.

That’s the core argument from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc), who said Bitcoin futures volumes have been “cut in half since November 22,” dropping from $123 billion in daily volume to $63 billion. Futures, Not ETFs, Are Holding Bitcoin In Place The slowdown, he added, “partly explains the low volatility observed on BTC in recent weeks.” But the bigger point is relative scale: at $63 billion per day, futures still represent “nearly 20 times the volume of spot Bitcoin ETFs ($3.4B) and about 10 times spot market volumes ($6B),” according to the analyst. In other words, even if ETF outflows are real and visible, they may not be the dominant marginal force setting the tone. “Many continue to point to ETFs, which have experienced significant outflows in recent weeks,” Darkfost wrote. “While these outflows do contribute to selling pressure, futures markets clearly remain the dominant force in overall volumes.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Dump Is Over: On-Chain Data Just Flipped Darkfost pointed to net taker volume, a derivatives metric used to infer whether aggressive buying or selling is dominating, as a cleaner read on why price has struggled to trend. He framed it in conditional terms based on prior market behavior: “Each time net taker volume has turned negative, Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase. When this indicator moves into negative territory, selling volume dominates.” In his telling, the market has been living with that bias for months. Since July, net taker volume has “generally remained negative,” he said, with one notable interruption: “A noticeable slowdown occurred in early October, allowing Bitcoin to set a new all time high, but selling pressure quickly regained control. Today, selling volumes continue to dominate and have kept Bitcoin trapped in a range for about a month.” There is, however, a tentative improvement in the same dataset. Darkfost said futures-driven selling pressure has declined since early November, with net taker volume improving from around -$489 million to -$93 million. He described that as “a positive signal,” but not yet enough to change the regime. “Liquidity remains weak,” he wrote, adding that ETF and spot volumes are “still too limited to allow BTC to break out of its current consolidation phase.” Demand Is Key In a separate X post, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research Julio Moreno added a broader framing that shifts attention away from chart-based cycle narratives and toward demand dynamics. “Most are focusing on price performance to define a cycle, when it is demand what they should be looking to,” Moreno wrote. “Bitcoin demand is contracting on monthly terms and slowing down significantly on an annual basis (and about to get into negative territory).” Alongside the futures-driven explanation for Bitcoin’s stall, the selling pressure from long-term holders (LTHs) emerged in recent weeks as the main driver for Bitcoin lagging performance against the stock market and gold. As reported yesterday, the long-term holder selling appeared to have stopped, according to multiple on-chain commentators, with around 10,700 BTC transitioning into long term held coins. Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast In his latest post, leading Glassnode analyst CryptoVizArt argued the change is more about tempo than direction. “LTHs didn’t stop selling,” the analyst wrote, claiming LTHs “are still spending ~7.3k BTC/day (7D SMA) and still realizing <$200M/day in profit. What changed is the rate, not the behavior. This is a cooldown after months of heavy distribution, not a flip to pure accumulation.” Darkfost didn’t dispute that LTHs can be persistent sellers, but he emphasized a different lens. “LTHs never really stop selling in reality, but when we look at supply change, it gives a different picture,” he wrote. “It appears that their distribution has come to an end for now, meaning the amount of BTC maturing and transitioning into LTH status equals the BTC being sold by LTHs (STH buying).” At press time, BTC traded at $87,972.

XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are currently among the top assets to watch as potential best crypto to buy. With Bitcoin holding around $87.5K, most altcoins are still sitting more than 50% below their all-time highs. Bitcoin has effectively broken the traditional four-year cycle, so no one can say for sure what will happen next. Still, from a fundamental standpoint, SOL, XRP, and DOGE stand out as some of the most interesting choices going into the new year, and here is why. Ripple (XRP) Could Head To $8: Bank Analyst Predicts XRP just hit an eight-year low in terms of supply available on exchanges. Fewer coins on exchanges usually signal accumulation as price hits new lows. This long-term accumulation is mainly supported by ETFs, which have now recorded over $1.4B in inflows since launch. That represents almost 0.75% of the total supply in a couple of months. Analysts from banking giant Standard Chartered have predicted XRP could skyrocket more than 300% to over $8 in 2026, driven by demand from spot XRP ETFs and the regulatory clarity the asset now has. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. If that level holds, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 48, which leaves room for a short-term rally toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Solana (SOL) is The Top Chain In 2025 Solana is no longer an emerging chain. It ended 2025 as the top blockchain by revenue, pulling in over $1.4B and surpassing Hyperliquid, which ranked second. Solana was also the leading chain by DEX volume and ranked second only to Binance Smart Chain in active addresses in November, even though those months were among the weakest periods for the network. Source: Cryptorank Another major milestone that cannot be ignored is the approval of Solana ETFs. These are expected to drive fresh growth for the ecosystem, similar to what happened at launch, when SOL saw 21 straight days of inflows. With all of this happening while price continues to hold above its 18-month support, Solana could be setting up for explosive performance in 2026. Technically, SOL is currently still leaning bearish. Price is stuck inside a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, printing lower highs since the $145 peak and repeatedly tapping support around $117–$118. The fact that this support has held twice actually matters more than most people think. If Solana can break and hold above the $127.50–$130.50 zone, momentum could flip fast. That would open the door to $133 first, then a retest of the channel top around $139–$140. If it fails instead, $118 comes back into play, with $112 as the next deeper support to watch. If You Bet On Memecoins, You Bet On Dogecoin (DOGE) Memecoins were mostly dead in 2025. After starting the year strong with a Solana-led memecoin season, the Trump memecoin launch marked the turning point. That single event likely damaged retail trust in memecoins more than anything else, as the Trump token kept sliding and never recovered. Since then, sentiment has dropped to its lowest levels in years. Still, some believe memecoins always come back when nobody expects them. If you are one of those, then Dogecoin is the obvious pick. It is still the leader of the memecoin space and is currently down more than 62% year over year. Dogecoin price has been descending for a while now. It hit $0.12, which is a yearly low, and it is currently holding around that level. For now, this zone is acting as a demand floor, but repeated tests tend to weaken support. If sellers stay in control, the risk of a breakdown increases. On the upside, the $0.14 area stands out as a key resistance level. It lines up with prior consolidation and multiple rejection points. As long as Dogecoin stays below this zone, any upside move is likely corrective rather than a full trend reversal. A more meaningful bullish signal would only appear if price reclaims and holds above the broader $0.16 resistance band. That kind of move would signal a momentum shift and could open the door for a recovery toward $0.18 first, and potentially $0.20–$0.21, which matches the higher targets marked on the chart. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The High-Conviction Wildcard for 2026 While majors like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are rebuilding structure, some investors are looking further out on the risk curve. That is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) keeps showing up. Bitcoin Hyper just crossed a $30M milestone raised, a key psychological level that signals growing conviction from early buyers. The idea is simple but powerful: extend Bitcoin into a high-speed Layer 2 environment without sacrificing its brand or liquidity gravity. Built as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2, Hyper focuses on fast settlement, low fees, and smart-contract compatibility, opening the door for DeFi, payments, and yield strategies that native Bitcoin cannot handle efficiently today. Instead of competing with BTC, it is designed to scale Bitcoin usage. The reason some are paying attention now is timing. Presales that clear major funding milestones tend to see renewed interest as narratives rotate back to infrastructure plays. With Bitcoin holding near $87K and altcoins still depressed, capital is increasingly hunting for asymmetric setups tied to the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. Bitcoin Hyper is still early, still speculative, but the $30M raised mark suggests this is no longer flying under the radar. If Bitcoin-centric Layer 2 narratives take off in 2026, $HYPER could be one of the names traders circle next.

Tether Has Purchased Another 8,888 Bitcoin In a new post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has shared the blockchain details of a Bitcoin transaction that the company made during the past day. With this transfer, the firm moved exactly 8,888.8888888 BTC from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex to its BTC reserve. Tether is a digital asset company best known for being the issuer of the stablecoin USDT. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their price pegged to a fiat currency and USDT, tied to the US Dollar, is currently the largest asset of this type in the world in terms of market cap . Tether has been maintaining a Bitcoin reserve since 2023, when it announced that it will regularly be allocating 15% of its net realized operating profits to the number one cryptocurrency as part of a new investment strategy. The company has since gradually been adding to the reserve, with the latest expansion announced by Ardoino corresponding to accumulation that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2025. At the time that the transaction shared by the Tether CEO occurred, the new coins were worth $778.7 million. This latest purchase has taken the company’s total holdings to 96,370 BTC, equivalent to more than $8.46 billion. For comparison, the second largest public Bitcoin treasury company, MARA Holdings, owns just 53,250 BTC ($4.68 billion). Thus, the firm’s BTC reserve is one of the largest in the world. Though, while Tether’s holdings are very significant, they still pale in comparison to Strategy, the largest corporate holder of the asset. Led by co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company has been accumulating the coin for years now, with the latest purchase coming just this Monday. This buy, involving 1,229 BTC, took the treasury firm’s total holdings to 672,497 BTC to cap off 2025. At the current exchange rate, this massive reserve is worth more than $59.1 billion. Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency sector have been experiencing a bearish phase since the top in October, but it would appear that this market shift hasn’t discouraged the likes of Tether and Strategy from accumulating more of the asset. The bearish momentum in the sector has also affected the stablecoins. As data from DefiLlama shows, the market cap of these assets was following an uptrend between 2024 and the last quarter of 2025. Since October, though, growth has flatlined. As mentioned before, Tether’s USDT is the most dominant stablecoin. It makes up for $187 billion of the $308 billion market cap attached to the sector. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $87,900, down 0.5% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Tether|Tether Bitcoin|USDT,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Recent analysis of Bitcoin options market data reveals sophisticated institutional players are implementing income-generating strategies that may inadvertently suppress Bitcoin’s price potential while simultaneously reducing market volatility. This development represents a significant maturation phase for cryptocurrency markets as traditional finance methodologies increasingly intersect with digital asset trading. Bitcoin Covered Calls: The Institutional Income Strategy Covered call strategies represent a sophisticated options trading approach that institutional investors have adapted for cryptocurrency markets. Essentially, this strategy involves holding spot Bitcoin while simultaneously selling call options against that position. The call options give buyers the right to purchase Bitcoin at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. Meanwhile, the seller collects premium income from these option sales. Several factors have driven institutional adoption of Bitcoin covered calls: Declining cash-and-carry yields falling below 5% annually Attractive income potential offering 12-18% annual returns Risk management benefits in volatile cryptocurrency markets Portfolio diversification for traditional investment firms This institutional activity has created a measurable impact on Bitcoin’s market structure. According to cryptocurrency derivatives data from major exchanges including Deribit and CME Group, the consistent selling of call options has contributed to declining implied volatility throughout 2025 contracts. Volatility Compression in Bitcoin Markets Bitcoin’s implied volatility metrics provide compelling evidence of how covered call strategies are reshaping market dynamics. Implied volatility represents the market’s forecast of likely price movement and serves as a crucial indicator for options pricing and risk assessment. Throughout 2025 contracts, Bitcoin’s implied volatility has experienced a notable decline from approximately 70% to around 45%. This volatility compression reflects several interconnected market developments: Time Period Implied Volatility Level Market Interpretation Early 2025 Contracts ~70% High uncertainty, speculative positioning Mid-2025 Contracts ~55% Increasing institutional participation Current 2025 Contracts ~45% Mature options market, covered call prevalence The declining volatility trend indicates that consistent selling pressure from covered call strategies has reduced overall market uncertainty. However, market analysts note this compression creates a complex trading environment where price breakouts face systematic resistance from option-related selling activity. Countervailing Market Forces and Price Discovery Despite the suppressing effect of covered call strategies, Bitcoin markets demonstrate robust countervailing forces that maintain trading equilibrium. Significant buying demand for call options continues to offset institutional selling pressure, creating a dynamic marketplace where multiple strategies interact. Furthermore, demand for put options—which provide downside protection—remains consistently strong, indicating sophisticated risk management across institutional portfolios. This options market activity reflects broader cryptocurrency market maturation. Institutional capital now pursues volatility-based profits through sophisticated derivatives strategies rather than simple directional bets. The resulting market structure features reduced extreme volatility while potentially limiting explosive upside moves that characterized earlier Bitcoin market cycles. Historical Context and Market Evolution Bitcoin’s options market has evolved dramatically since the launch of regulated derivatives products in recent years. Initially dominated by retail speculation and directional betting, institutional participation has transformed market dynamics through 2024 and into 2025. This evolution parallels developments in traditional financial markets where options strategies became increasingly sophisticated over decades. Several key developments have facilitated this institutional adoption: Regulatory clarity in major financial jurisdictions Infrastructure development including custody solutions Risk management tools tailored for cryptocurrency Educational resources for institutional investors Market analysts compare current Bitcoin options activity to early stages of equity options markets, where covered call strategies similarly gained prominence among income-focused investors. This historical parallel suggests Bitcoin markets may experience continued options strategy diversification as institutional participation deepens. Impact on Bitcoin Price Discovery Mechanisms The proliferation of covered call strategies influences Bitcoin’s price discovery process through several interconnected channels. First, consistent call option selling creates technical resistance levels at strike prices where significant option volume concentrates. Second, the income generated from premium collection reduces pressure for immediate price appreciation among institutional holders. Third, volatility suppression affects algorithmic trading systems that respond to volatility signals. These dynamics create a more predictable but potentially constrained trading environment. Bitcoin’s price movements may exhibit reduced frequency of extreme volatility events while facing systematic resistance at key technical levels corresponding to options activity. Market participants must now account for options-related flows alongside traditional supply-demand factors when analyzing Bitcoin price action. Institutional Portfolio Implications For institutional investors, covered call strategies offer compelling risk-adjusted returns in cryptocurrency allocations. By generating consistent income through option premiums, institutions can improve portfolio yield while maintaining Bitcoin exposure. This approach particularly appeals to pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies with specific return requirements and risk parameters. However, these strategies involve trade-offs that institutions carefully evaluate. The opportunity cost of capped upside potential must balance against premium income and volatility reduction. Sophisticated institutions typically implement dynamic covered call approaches that adjust strike prices and expiration dates based on market conditions and outlook. Market Structure Analysis and Future Projections Current Bitcoin options market structure reveals a maturing ecosystem where multiple participant types interact through sophisticated strategies. Retail traders, proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, and traditional asset managers now employ diverse approaches ranging from simple directional bets to complex volatility arbitrage. This diversity contributes to market efficiency while creating unique dynamics like the covered call effect on price ceilings. Looking forward, market analysts project several potential developments: Strategy diversification beyond basic covered calls Cross-asset correlations with traditional markets Regulatory developments affecting derivatives trading Technological innovations in options execution These developments will likely further integrate Bitcoin into global financial markets while potentially altering the relationship between options activity and spot price dynamics. Market participants must continuously monitor options market metrics alongside traditional analysis to understand evolving Bitcoin price drivers. Conclusion Bitcoin covered call strategies represent a significant development in cryptocurrency market evolution, potentially creating subtle ceilings on price appreciation while reducing overall volatility. This institutional activity reflects broader market maturation as sophisticated derivatives strategies become increasingly prevalent. While potentially limiting explosive upside moves, these developments contribute to market stability and institutional participation. Bitcoin’s options market dynamics will continue evolving throughout 2025, requiring market participants to adapt their analysis frameworks to account for derivatives-related flows alongside traditional factors. The interplay between covered call strategies and Bitcoin price discovery mechanisms represents a crucial area for ongoing market observation and analysis. FAQs Q1: What exactly are Bitcoin covered call strategies? Bitcoin covered call strategies involve holding spot Bitcoin while selling call options against that position. This approach generates premium income for the seller while potentially limiting upside if Bitcoin’s price rises above the option strike price. Q2: How do covered calls potentially limit Bitcoin’s price upside? When institutional investors consistently sell call options at specific price levels, they create selling pressure if Bitcoin approaches those levels. This activity can establish technical resistance that suppresses price breakouts, effectively creating a ceiling on upward momentum. Q3: Why are institutional investors using covered call strategies for Bitcoin? Institutions pursue covered call strategies primarily for income generation (12-18% annual returns), volatility reduction, and risk management. These approaches offer attractive risk-adjusted returns compared to declining yields from other cryptocurrency strategies. Q4: What does declining implied volatility indicate about Bitcoin markets? Declining implied volatility from 70% to around 45% for 2025 contracts suggests reduced market uncertainty and increased institutional participation. This volatility compression reflects more sophisticated trading strategies and potentially more stable price action. Q5: How does options market activity signal Bitcoin market maturation? Sophisticated options strategies like covered calls, robust put option demand for hedging, and institutional participation all indicate maturing markets. These developments mirror evolution in traditional financial markets and suggest Bitcoin is becoming more integrated into global finance.

The analyst projected three potential scenarios for Bitcoin in 2026. The first scenario, which carries the highest probability, suggests that if rate-cut expectations persist throughout 2026, “Bitcoin is likely to trade within a broad $80,000-$140,000 range , with $90,000-$120,000 as the core zone.” The second scenario, with medium probability, indicates that if recession risks intensify, the resulting deleveraging and ETF outflows could push Bitcoin below $80,000, with movement toward the $50,000 range conceivable. The third scenario, carrying low probability according to XWIN Research, proposes that if Fed easing expectations materialize early and ETF inflows stabilize, Bitcoin could extend toward $120,000-$170,000, with higher levels possible only under multiple favorable conditions. Currently, a range-bound structure remains the most plausible baseline for 2026, subject to reassessment as structural data evolves. This aligns with current sentiment from traders on Kalshi prediction market who project Bitcoin hitting a high of $121,000 this year, suggesting a range between the current $80,000 levels and $120,000 is highly plausible in 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Healthy Mid-Cycle Correction The weekly Bitcoin chart shows a mature bull market that has entered a healthy corrective phase rather than a structural breakdown. After bottoming in 2023 following a deep 77% bear-market drawdown, Bitcoin rallied strongly through 2024 and into 2025, eventually topping near the $120,000-$125,000 region. The subsequent pullback of roughly 37% mirrors past mid-cycle corrections and has thus far respected higher-timeframe support. The most crucial level on the downside is the $67,000-$70,000 zone, which previously functioned as a major consolidation base and breakout region. Source: TradingView Provided this support maintains on a weekly closing basis, the long-term bullish structure remains intact. On the upside, the $105,000 region represents the key resistance Bitcoin must reclaim to signal bull trend resumption. A decisive weekly close above $105,000 would likely open the way for broader recovery toward $121,000 and potentially new highs later in 2026. Until that reclaim occurs, Bitcoin may continue consolidating between the $70,000 support and $105,000 resistance, with the higher-timeframe bias remaining bullish provided the macro support zone isn’t lost.

Meanwhile, posts on X linked the drop to dilution, index risk, and a shrinking NAV premium, despite Strategy still holding about $59 billion in Bitcoin versus a roughly $46 billion market cap. Benchmark Reiterates Buy on Strategy, Keeps $705 Target for 2026 Investment bank The Benchmark Company has reiterated its buy rating on Strategy, maintaining a $705 price target tied to 2026 expectations, according to reports circulating on Wednesday. The note continues to frame Strategy primarily as a bitcoin-focused treasury company, rather than a traditional software valuation story. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said the price target reflects Strategy’s large and growing Bitcoin holdings and the firm’s capital structure, which amplifies exposure to long-term bitcoin price movements. As a result, the research treats Strategy shares as a proxy for bitcoin performance, with added leverage from equity and debt instruments used to fund acquisitions. While several crypto news platforms reported the reiteration on Wednesday, the analysis itself does not appear to be newly issued. Instead, the coverage references a Benchmark research note first published in early December and resurfaced at the start of the new year. No changes to the rating or price target were disclosed, and Benchmark did not announce a revised forecast. Strategy, remains one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. Consequently, its stock has continued to attract investor attention during periods of heightened focus on corporate bitcoin treasury strategies. Strategy Shares Slide as Market Cap Falls Below Bitcoin Holdings Shares of Strategy have dropped sharply over the past six months, underscoring how quickly market narratives can reverse for bitcoin-focused equities. According to price data shown on a widely shared chart, Strategy stock fell from about $457 to roughly $152, a decline of nearly 66%, erasing an estimated $90 billion in market value over the period. In a post on X, a market commentator said the sell-off went beyond bitcoin’s broader pullback. Instead, the post pointed to equity dilution, index-related risks, and a collapse in Strategy’s net asset value premium as the main drivers of the decline. As the premium compressed, investors appeared to reassess how much they were willing to pay above the company’s underlying bitcoin holdings. Despite the steep drop in its share price, Strategy’s balance sheet remains largely unchanged. The company still holds about $59 billion worth of bitcoin, based on prevailing market prices cited in the post. By contrast, Strategy’s equity market capitalization stands near $46 billion, implying that the stock now trades below the value of its bitcoin reserves. The gap between asset value and market capitalization highlights the role of investor sentiment in pricing bitcoin-heavy companies. While Strategy’s holdings stayed intact, shifting expectations around leverage, dilution, and index exposure appear to have reshaped how the market values the stock, leaving the same balance sheet viewed through a very different psychological lens.",News|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Top cryptos such as XRP will be on a winning streak with the institutional approach and developments in the payments sector. But it may be the new cheap crypto coin Mutuum Finance with a price of $0.04 that may attract attention. XRP Price In the event that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is set to have a price cycle top at $250,000, there might be an increase in the price of XRP as well. Although the year 2025 has turned out very badly for the whole altcoin market, as it has fallen as low as 42% in value, it is very interesting that the price of XRP has fallen merely by 15%. This is in line with the fast expansion that Ripple is making, which includes more than $2.7 billion worth of acquisitions in payments, treasury management software and trading infrastructure. Another factor which has worked in favor of XRP is the improvement in the regulatory environment, where Ripple has finally closed its case in the SEC after a couple of years, paving the way for new investments. If a price rise is to happen, then it is likely that the defensive holding qualities of XRP, along with the resilience it has shown in the past, may help it to deliver huge profits. However, XRP is unlikely to be the next big crypto. Factors such as its large market cap could lead to minimal growth. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance could easily shock the market with its upside. MUTM Presale Phase 7 is Now Open Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now launched Phase 7 of its presale, and token prices are set at $0.04. It follows Phase 6, where the token was set at $0.035, an increase of 15%. The project has shown incredible momentum, and analysts see the token breaking past its $0.06 market debut price in no time. If Bitcoin hits $250,000 in the next bull run, Mutuum Finance could soar as high as 50x from its current price to hit $2. This will position MUTM as one of the best performing DeFi cryptos in the 2026 bull run. In addition, an investment of just $100 at today’s price will balloon to $5000 if this rally materializes. Since the presale began, more than 18,630 investors have participated, and over $19.5 million of funding has been raised. The dual nature of the token, together with the soon-to-be-launched V1 Sepolia Testnet, continues to attract investors, as there is genuine utility in play. MUTM has been audited by Certik, where the project emerged with a 90/100 token scan score, showing it’s a safe investment opportunity. White hackers can also participate in a $50,000 bug bounty program to identify possible vulnerabilities in the project. These measures show how seriously the team behind Mutuum Finance takes security. As a result, smart money investors recognize MUTM as a high-potential crypto to buy now. Passive Income for Users An important aspect of Mutuum Finance is its mtToken system, which rewards individuals who bring assets to lend to the platform. While traditional assets only generate interest when they are withdrawn, mtTokens provide investors with the opportunity to generate passive income in real-time while still enjoying liquidity. This is an innovative platform that improves MUTM’s usable utility in the marketplace and solidifies it as the most promising cheap crypto coin to invest in 2026. Halborn Security Audit & Testnet Launch Aside from an audit by CertiK, Halborn Security has also conducted an independent audit of MUTM, concentrating on its lending and borrowing contracts. The MUTM team has integrated the audit’s feedback and is now preparing for Sepolia testnet debut. The tesnet will mark the project’s first public deployment. This version will introduce core components including: Liquidity Pools for lending and borrowing mtTokens representing user deposits and accrued yield Debt Tokens tracking borrowed positions An Automated Liquidator Bot to manage under-collateralized loans Initially, the protocol will support ETH and USDT as primary assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral. The testnet launch allows users and users to interact with the platform, provide feedback, and help optimize the system before mainnet release. Buy XRP or MUTM? If Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $250,000 in 2026, both XRP and Mutuum Finance are primed for rallies. However, while XRP’s upside could easily be limited by its large market cap, MUTM shows potential for up to 50x returns. With a cost of just $0.04 in Phase 7, MUTM already boasts over $19.5M in funds raised in its fast-growing presale. This makes MUTM not only a crypto to buy now but a no-brainer pick over XRP.

Two charts shared on X tracked rising global M2 trends and a late 2025 jump in U.S. repo liquidity, while BTC stayed near the top of its recent range. Together, the posts added to the liquidity narrative around Bitcoin. However, the same data also showed a gap between improving money metrics and short term BTC direction. Global M2 Turns Higher Again as Bitcoin Tracks Liquidity Chart A chart circulating on X shows global money supply climbing and annual growth turning higher again, as Bitcoin trades near the top of its recent range. The post came from crypto commentator Crypto Rover, who wrote that “Global Liquidity is surging,” while sharing a CoinGlass graphic titled “Bitcoin Price and Global M2 Supply & Growth.” Bitcoin Price and Global M2 Supply Growth. Source: CoinGlass / X The chart overlays three series: Bitcoin’s price in gold, global M2 supply in a light blue line, and global M2 year over year growth as vertical bars. The M2 supply line trends upward across the full period and finishes near the upper end of the scale, while the growth bars shift from earlier negative readings to positive territory in the most recent section highlighted on the right side. Bitcoin’s price line rises alongside prior periods of stronger M2 growth on the chart, then moves through extended swings as the growth rate cools and later recovers. In the latest portion, the gold line sits near the upper band of its recent levels, while the M2 supply line continues to edge higher and the growth bars print larger positive readings than earlier in the year. Analysts often use global M2 as a broad proxy for liquidity conditions because it reflects the amount of money in circulation across major economies. However, the graphic does not show causation, and Bitcoin can diverge from liquidity measures for long stretches due to market structure, leverage cycles, policy expectations, and crypto specific shocks. Even so, the shared chart frames a simple message: as global M2 supply expands and the growth rate improves, Bitcoin remains closely watched for whether it follows the same direction seen during prior liquidity upswings. Fed Repo Operations Add Fresh Liquidity as Bitcoin Holds Range Meanwhile, a chart shared on X by Ted Pillows shows the U.S. Federal Reserve adding sizable liquidity to the financial system through recent repo operations, even as Bitcoin price action remains largely unchanged. According to the chart, the Fed injected about $74.6 billion into the U.S. economy over the past three months, based on accepted repo amounts. Federal Reserve Repo Liquidity Injections. Source: Federal Reserve via Ted Pillows The graphic covers the period from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2025, and breaks down liquidity by security type. Treasury repos accounted for roughly $31.5 billion at the end of December, while mortgage backed securities made up about $43.1 billion. Agency securities showed no activity in the latest snapshot. The data reflects short term funding support rather than a shift in long term monetary policy. Repo operations are typically used to stabilize funding markets and manage short term liquidity needs. As a result, these injections often fluctuate around quarter ends or periods of higher funding stress. The chart highlights several spikes in late October, early November, early December, and again near year end, with the largest bars appearing in the final days of December. Despite the increase in liquidity shown on the chart, Bitcoin has not posted a clear directional response over the same window. Price action has stayed range bound, suggesting that short term repo injections alone may not be enough to drive immediate moves in BTC. Market participants often distinguish between temporary liquidity operations and sustained balance sheet expansion when assessing potential impacts on risk assets. The chart reinforces the ongoing debate around how closely Bitcoin tracks liquidity conditions, especially when injections are technical and short lived rather than structural shifts in monetary stance.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In a detailed post on X, Davidson said the current environment explains why crypto markets feel flat or stagnant, despite global adoption continuing elsewhere. Davidson tied the slowdown to what he described as the collapse of crypto’s original disintermediation use case in the United States. He argued that when digital assets mirror traditional account based finance, they lose any real advantage over banks. As a result, capital and users avoid U.S. markets , while activity shifts offshore. He added that legal uncertainty and slow legislation have amplified the problem. According to Davidson, regulatory pressure has discouraged innovation, while enforcement actions against developers have sent a signal that self custody and privacy tools face growing risk. GENIUS Act and stablecoin structure concerns Davidson pointed directly to the GENIUS Act, which became law in 2025 and created a federal framework for stablecoins. He said the law favors banks by using an account based model and blocking non banks from paying interest on stablecoins. In his view, that structure weakens competition and limits user choice. He also warned that the framework does not clearly protect self custody. Instead, he said it lays the groundwork for what he called a “wholesale CBDC,” even if the term central bank digital currency is not used directly. Davidson argued that the back end features of CBDCs, such as tracking and permissioned access, are being built quietly. At the same time, he acknowledged that stablecoins could increase demand for U.S. Treasuries and help manage federal debt costs. Still, he said those benefits come with trade offs, including higher surveillance and less financial autonomy for users. CLARITY Act and fears of digital ID expansion The broader digital asset market, Davidson said, now depends on the fate of the CLARITY Act, which passed the House but remains stalled in the Senate. He noted that the bill aims to define rules for tokenized commodities, securities, and real world assets, while also addressing gaps in the stablecoin law. However, Davidson expressed skepticism that the Senate will deliver meaningful changes. Even if the bill passes, he said any protections for individual freedom may be cosmetic and leave the account based system intact. He closed with a warning that digital ID and CBDC style systems could merge in the future. According to Davidson, tying identity to money risks expanding surveillance and control, undermining the original promise of Bitcoin as a permissionless peer to peer payment system.",News|Legal,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The latest stash brings its total holdings to over 96,000 coins, which is worth roughly $8.46 billion. The purchase of around $779 million was confirmed by CEO Paolo Ardoino on X and continues the company’s ongoing “8888” accumulation pattern. Tether’s Diversification Strategy Tether started buying Bitcoin back in September 2022. In May 2023, the company made its plan official, announcing that it would dedicate 15% of its quarterly net profits to purchasing Bitcoin. Since that announcement, the company behind the USDT stablecoin has steadily added to its holdings every quarter. It has followed a long-term strategy focused on diversifying its reserves and strengthening its financial position. In addition to Bitcoin, Tether has been steadily building a significant gold reserve. By Q3 2025, the company held around 116 metric tons of physical gold. In September, Ardoino addressed rumors that alleged that the firm had sold Bitcoin to buy gold. The speculation began after YouTuber Clive Thompson claimed the firm quietly changed its investment approach, allegedly selling over $1 billion in BTC while acquiring $1.6 billion in gold during Q2 2025. The BTC acquisition, however, came as the crypto asset ended the year on a weak note. Prices fell to $88,000 in late 2025, which contributed to a 23.07% negative return for the quarter, according to Coinglass. This makes the second-worst Q4 performance on record behind Q4 2018. Despite the downturn, Tether seized the opportunity to steadily increase its exposure, even as other institutional buyers pulled back. Corporate Treasuries Struggle Bitcoin adoption by corporations started strong in early 2025, and many companies added crypto to their balance sheets, thanks to the model popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Early price gains made the model appealing, but the October downturn eroded confidence. As a result, shares in some of the largest players are sharply down. Companies that had been aggressive buyers now face pressure to stabilize their finances in 2026. Prenetics, which raised $48 million partly to build a Bitcoin treasury, announced it would halt additional purchases.

Henrik Zeberg shared a strongly bearish assessment of the market’s current structure in a post on the social media platform X with the conclusion that Bitcoin is no longer behaving like an asset in a healthy expansion phase. Instead, he described Bitcoin as approaching an important peak, warning that the current structure carries an elevated risk of a sharp downside move once that peak is in place. Bitcoin’s Expanding Diagonal Points To Price Top Zeberg’s Bitcoin outlook is based on the expanding diagonal structure on Bitcoin’s monthly candlestick timeframe chart. This long-term pattern, which has been playing out since Bitcoin’s creation, shows increasing volatility, with the Bitcoin price making higher highs and lower lows with a widening range. Related Reading: People Are Not Ready For Bitcoin; Analyst Reveals What’s Coming Next According to the chart he shared, Bitcoin appears to be completing the final stages of this structure, and this is expected to be characterized by exhaustion. Zeberg labels the current zone as a topping area, where upside progress becomes increasingly unstable even if the price continues to increase. Interestingly, the chart projected a final surge as a blow-off top that could carry Bitcoin to the mid-$150,000 range. However, in this framework, that final push is not a sign of strength but a hallmark of late-cycle overconfidence. Expanding diagonals tend to resolve violently once the structure breaks, and Zeberg views the current setup as looking like where optimism peaked just before a reversal. From Euphoria To A Deep Crash Scenario Zeberg’s most controversial claims are in his projected downside targets. According to him, once the final euphoric rally plays out and Bitcoin reaches above $150,000, it could enter into a collapse on a scale that most Bitcoin investors currently consider unthinkable. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts When The Bitcoin Supercycle Will Actually Begin He compared the setup to the dot-com era, when the Nasdaq fell by more than 80%, and noted that Bitcoin has historically amplified both upside and downside moves. Based on that logic, he predicted a scenario where a broader AI and crypto bubble unwinds, leading to a Bitcoin price crash of about 97% or 98% from the eventual peak. This translates into a technical minimum target between $3,000 and $4,000, with the possibility of even deeper declines. Although the final rally may be dramatic, holding through the subsequent crash could be devastating for unprepared investors. Zeberg also highlighted momentum indicators that he believes support the bearish outlook. Bitcoin is showing what he describes as massive bearish divergence on the monthly timeframe. This is a situation where price continues to grind higher but momentum indicators such as the RSI fail to confirm those highs. Another indicator is the monthly MACD, which is also approaching, or already printing, a bearish crossover on the long-term chart.

Source: Coinbase Bitcoin Trades Sideways as On-chain Metrics Split Selling pressure, while present, is not indicative of panic. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key on-chain indicator, hovers just below neutral at 0.994 . This suggests that coins being sold are moving, on average, close to their original purchase price, ruling out a fear-driven capitulation. At the same time, demand from U.S. spot markets has cooled, evidenced by a negative Coinbase Premium Index of -0.09, which indicates slightly lower prices on the U.S.-based exchange compared to global counterparts. Counterbalancing this light sell-side pressure is a steady trend of accumulation. Recent data showed a large net outflow of BTC from centralized exchanges, continuing a pattern of investors moving assets into self-custody for long-term holding. BREAKING: CEX records a net outflow of 2,949.67 BTC in the past 24 hours According to Coinglass data, centralized exchanges saw significant Bitcoin outflows, led by Kraken, Bybit, and Coinbase Pro. Meanwhile, Binance recorded a net inflow of 670.58 BTC, ranking first among… pic.twitter.com/mPxY7n6yoj — AVOLA (@Avolaofficial) December 22, 2025 This market structure has led analysts to forecast a prolonged period of range-bound activity. A report from XWIN Research Japan projects a high probability of Bitcoin trading between $80,000 and $140,000 for most of 2026. “As 2026 begins, it is still difficult to say that Bitcoin has clearly entered a new bullish phase,” a CryptoQuant contributor from XWIN Research Japan noted . “The market remains in a ‘high-volatility’ box range.” Institutional Perspectives and Trading Strategies The current on-chain stalemate suggests a mature, two-sided market where speculative froth has been reduced. For institutional desks, this environment shifts the strategic focus from trend-following to range-trading. The defined support and resistance levels make options strategies, such as selling strangles or straddles, more viable as traders can capitalize on time decay while the underlying asset remains compressed. The persistent exchange outflows indicate that any major dip is likely to be met with strong accumulation, providing a structural floor for the market. The key takeaway is that the next major directional move will likely require an external catalyst—either a macroeconomic shift or a major change in ETF inflow dynamics—to break the current deadlock.

This was the first time in history that the world’s largest cryptocurrency ended a post-halving year in the red. After the April 2024 halving, which traditionally sets the stage for strong gains in the following 12-18 months, BTC rallied to a new all-time high above $126,000 in October before reversing sharply in the final months of the year. ETFs, Macro Pressure, and a Broken Cycle According to market data, Bitcoin finished 2025 lower than where it started, as the yearly candle closed below its January opening price. This scenario had never happened after any of the previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020. This unusual performance has reignited debate over the fate of the so-called “four-year cycle” that many traders have relied on to predict post-halving bull runs. Some analysts argue the cycle’s breakdown reflects Bitcoin’s growing role as a macro risk asset influenced more by broader financial markets, ETF flows, and regulation than by simple supply mechanics. Meanwhile, others see it as a correction within a still-intact long-term trend. Throughout 2025, BTC faced mixed signals: strong institutional interest and growing ETF adoption, but also macroeconomic headwinds that weighed on risk assets across the world. Investor Armando Pantoja, for one, said that the market structure has fundamentally changed, and old assumptions no longer apply. “The Market Has New Players – Crypto isn’t 2016 or 2020 anymore. ETFs, institutions, and corporate balance sheets don’t trade like hype-driven retail. Bitcoin Trades Macro Now – BTC reacts to liquidity, rates, regulation, and geopolitics – not a perfect halving calendar. Patterns break when everyone expects them. Halving ≠ Mechanical Pump – The halving still matters, but supply is increasingly locked, miners have financing options, and price dynamics aren’t as automatic as before.” Deeper Downside Ahead Bitcoin advocate and long-time industry voice Simon Dixon also shared a similar view while declaring the end of BTC’s traditional four-year market cycle, and argued that the asset is entering a “new era.” As BTC slid over 30% in the final months since its October peak, several market watchers believe that the worst is yet to come. Doctor Profit, for one, has repeatedly warned that the bottom has not transpired and instead sees a new leg down towards the $60,000-$70,000 area in a matter of time.

Source: SosoValue The bearish year-end momentum extended across crypto investment products, with Ethereum ETFs recording $72.06 million in outflows and no inflows registered among the nine available funds. However, Solana and XRP spot ETFs posted modest gains of $2.29 million and $5.58 million, respectively. The dramatic close accompanied a $74.6 billion liquidity injection through the Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility , the largest single-day usage since COVID-19, as banks borrowed against Treasuries and mortgage bonds to manage year-end funding pressures. Source: X/@coinbureau While analysts characterized this as typical seasonal balance sheet management rather than emergency quantitative easing, the Fed’s intervention indicated potential flexibility on monetary policy heading into 2026, reducing near-term tightening risks that could benefit risk assets. Institutional Optimism Meets Market Caution Charles Schwab strategist Michael Townsend attributed Bitcoin’s earlier surge past $90,000 to regulatory clarity following the U.S. elections, estimating that prior regulatory overhang suppressed Bitcoin by approximately 50% of its potential value. “ We had basically regulatory overhang, which I think was holding Bitcoin down significantly, probably to the tune of 50%, which is why we saw a big spike, ” Townsend explained in a CNBC appearance, forecasting 2026 gains from quantitative easing and Fed bond purchases. CHARLES SCHWAB BULLISH ON BITCOIN IN 2026 Schwab says regulatory overhang may have capped BTC by 50%. But, with QE, Fed bond buying, and weaker demand for government debt, the setup looks bullish for Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/ulA4G5osEL — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) January 1, 2026 Townsend highlighted deteriorating Treasury demand alongside anticipated rate cuts as bullish catalysts. “ I think demand for government debt is going to fall significantly next year, along with lower rates. So all of this bodes well for higher vol assets, including the likes of Bitcoin, ” he said. Schwab’s own crypto trading platform launch faces regulatory delays that could extend into mid-2026, tempering the firm’s immediate execution of its bullish thesis. Despite institutional optimism, ETF flows revealed persistent weakness, and Glassnode data showed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF 30-day simple moving averages remained negative throughout year-end, showing absent retail demand. Source: Glassnode Technical indicators painted a similarly distressed picture, with Bitcoin returning to “ Extreme Fear ” territory on the Fear and Greed Index, as analyst Quinten noted the asset had reached oversold levels historically associated with subsequent price doublings within three months.

Source: CryptoQuant Their medium-probability scenario envisions recession-driven deleveraging pushing Bitcoin toward $50,000, while a low-probability “ risk-on ” environment could extend prices to $120,000-$170,000 under favorable easing conditions and stabilized institutional inflows. Speaking with Cryptonews, Unchained’s Timot Lamarre contextualized 2025’s underperformance in terms of shifts in capital allocation. “ Money seeking risk found its way into Bitcoin treasury companies or the AI industry, and money trying to avoid debasement continued piling into precious metals, ” Lamarre said. Lamarre warned that mounting U.S. debt dynamics create political constraints limiting aggressive policy action ahead of the midterm elections. However, he projected that Bitcoin would be “ a leading beneficiary of cheaper and more abundant dollars ” once monetary loosening materializes. Institutional adoption milestones throughout 2025 included Vanguard reversing its longstanding crypto prohibition to allow trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETFs on its platform. Vanguard will allow trading of crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds starting Tuesday, opening access to Bitcoin, Ether and other tokens for millions of investors. #Vanguard #CryptoETFs https://t.co/mmU1DdIi7s — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2025 Last year, the CFTC also approved spot crypto ETFs on registered futures exchanges in early December. Speaking with Cryptonews, early Bitcoin investor Michael Terpin also forecasted a prolonged bear market mirroring historical post-halving patterns from 2014, 2018, and 2022, predicting Bitcoin could bottom around $60,000 in early fall before recovering into 2028-2029. “ There is still a ~20 percent chance of an extended bull cycle with a new high before the final correction, but it’s less and less likely as each month passes, ” Terpin noted, identifying year-end 2026 as an optimal accumulation period before potential supply shocks following the next halving event drive the subsequent cycle.

Bitcoin has reversed the recent peaks. Ether has failed to trade above critical levels. Memes formerly at the headline are experiencing follow-through. At such times, the focus is likely to shift rapidly to those projects that do not seem subject to wide swings. According to commentators on the market, this is when some DeFi crypto names start to shine. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the projects currently receiving low but consistent attention. Why Traders Are Now Paying Attention to Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is emerging to fame because it is constructed out of utility instead of market mood. On a high level, it is a decentralized protocol of lending and borrowing. Users will be able to provide assets to receive a yield and others can borrow liquidity on collateral under specified rules. The outstanding factor about MUTM when things are unpredictable is its organization. Lending business does not depend on the increment in the prices. It is also able to stay alive even during sideways markets. That is why there are traders who are becoming increasingly attentive as volatility accelerates. Mutuum Finance according to official statements published by the team on X is working on the V1 of their lending and borrowing protocol, and they will launch it to the Sepolia testnet. This next landmark puts the story closer to the hangman than to the thought. What The Numbers Are Indicating Price does not necessarily tell everything about participation metrics. Mutuum Finance has raised $19.5M and attracted 18,700 holders. This is important since such figures reflect activity that is most likely to be widely distributed as opposed to a concentrated activity. Market commentators usually explain this trend as building confidence with time. It implies that participants are positioning at an early but measured pace as is characteristic of infrastructure-related projects. At this point, these figures become indicators. MUTM is currently selling at $0.04 in presale at Phase 7 of distribution. The total supply of the token is 4B, and 45.5% of the total or approximately 1.82B tokens are assigned to the early stages. So far, 820M tokens have been sold. The position of the later-stages tightens as the allocation at the later stages gets closer. According to market commentators, this is the time when this is usually the case when the pricing becomes sensitive to emerging demand. The structure does not repeat the previous patterns suggesting that there will be less low-priced tokens as the next stage approaches. Security and Long-Term Focus In the case of a lending protocol, it is not up to chance that security is considered. Mutuum Finance has a 90/100 CertiK Token Scan score, which consists of good results in terms of token checks and configuration verification. The borrowing and lending arrangements are the other reviewed contracts, wherein the audit has been made and final updates awaited at Halborn Security . Also, there is a running bug bounty of 50k that is present to assist in determining possible vulnerabilities. This long-term perspective is supported by infrastructure plans. The use of coins will be a major factor in lending activity which will enable them to be used during volatile times. Connection to a database of reliable pricing via decentralized oracle data feeds with fallback will be provided. The roadmap also includes layer-2 compatibility, which will reduce the payment cost and access. The Urgency Window Ahead of 2026 Timing matters in crypto. The opportunities become narrow as distribution continues to get better. Phase 6 sold out fast and that decreased the allocation available and propelled MUTM to the present stage. Mutuum Finance operates a 24-hour leaderboard, where the person who contributes most on a particular day receives $500 in MUTM. The access of card payments has also increased demand of new participants enabling their easy entry. Investors are increasingly becoming choosy as 2026 draws near. Big caps provide low potential. Meme assets are based on cycles of attention. The new crypto projects of DeFi, which have imminent implementation and safeguards that can be seen, are gaining traction. Mutuum Finance now falls into that category. Development is advanced. Participation is broad. There are security review measures. V1 is approaching. The current status of MUTM illustrates a project that is transitioning to more broad areas of attention due to a slow build-up. Because of that change, it is now included in the discussion of the best crypto to watch as the next cycle of the market emerges.

Unlike Bitcoin ETFs, which currently hold approximately 7% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, altcoin funds struggle to accumulate significant portions of their underlying assets. This supply constraint creates immediate scalability issues. The cryptocurrency market structure itself presents additional hurdles. Bitcoin maintains dominant market positioning with established institutional recognition. Consequently, Bitcoin ETFs benefit from clearer regulatory frameworks and broader acceptance among traditional investors. Altcoin markets, while diverse and innovative, face fragmentation across hundreds of projects with varying fundamentals. Market Dynamics and Investor Behavior Patterns Analysts observe distinct behavioral patterns influencing altcoin ETF performance. These funds demonstrate heightened sensitivity to market trends compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. Short-term demand fluctuates directly with price movements, creating volatility challenges for fund managers. However, long-term investor interest continues growing steadily despite these fluctuations. Several factors contribute to this dynamic: Market Maturity Differences: Bitcoin’s longer market history provides stability Regulatory Clarity Variations: Bitcoin enjoys clearer regulatory treatment Institutional Adoption Levels: Major institutions prefer Bitcoin for initial exposure Liquidity Profiles: Bitcoin markets offer superior liquidity for large transactions Crypto ETF Market Share Remains Minimal Despite Growth Ripple Labs President Monica Long provides crucial context about the broader ETF landscape. More than 40 cryptocurrency ETFs have launched this year alone, yet their collective share of the massive U.S. ETF market remains minimal. This reality underscores the early-stage nature of cryptocurrency adoption within traditional finance structures. Long suggests wider adoption could accelerate participation from corporations and institutions. Large corporations increasingly explore financial strategies incorporating digital assets. They also show growing interest in tokenized asset investments. This corporate interest represents a potential growth vector for the entire cryptocurrency ETF sector. Cryptocurrency ETF Market Comparison (2025 Data) Metric Bitcoin ETFs Altcoin ETFs Circulating Supply Held ~7% Significantly Lower Market Sensitivity Moderate High Institutional Adoption Widespread Emerging Regulatory Clarity High Variable Institutional Adoption Pathways and Corporate Interest Corporate treasury strategies increasingly incorporate digital asset considerations. Major corporations now evaluate cryptocurrency exposure as part of broader financial planning. This shift represents a fundamental change from just two years ago when most corporations avoided cryptocurrency investments entirely. Tokenization of traditional assets creates additional opportunities. Real estate, commodities, and intellectual property increasingly move onto blockchain platforms. These tokenized assets require new investment vehicles, potentially benefiting specialized altcoin ETFs focused on specific sectors or technologies. Structural Differences Define Growth Trajectories Bitcoin and altcoin ETFs follow fundamentally different growth patterns. Bitcoin benefits from first-mover advantage and network effects that altcoins cannot easily replicate. The Bitcoin ecosystem has developed robust infrastructure over fifteen years, including mining networks, custody solutions, and regulatory relationships. Altcoin markets face fragmentation across multiple blockchain platforms. Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and other networks each have distinct characteristics and communities. This diversity creates richness but also complexity for ETF structures attempting to provide broad exposure. Several structural factors influence growth potential: Network Effects: Bitcoin’s established network creates barriers to displacement Security Models: Different consensus mechanisms affect institutional comfort levels Developer Ecosystems: Varying levels of development activity across projects Use Case Specialization: Altcoins often target specific applications rather than general store of value Regulatory Environment and Compliance Considerations Regulatory treatment varies significantly across different cryptocurrencies. The SEC and other regulators have provided clearer guidance for Bitcoin than for most altcoins. This regulatory uncertainty affects institutional adoption rates and ETF structure viability. Compliance requirements differ based on cryptocurrency classification. Securities laws apply differently to various digital assets, creating complex legal landscapes for ETF sponsors. These regulatory complexities add costs and uncertainties that particularly affect altcoin funds. Market Evolution and Future Development Pathways The cryptocurrency ETF market continues evolving rapidly. New structures emerge regularly as sponsors innovate to meet investor demand. These innovations include thematic funds, sector-specific products, and actively managed strategies that differ from traditional index-tracking approaches. Technological developments also influence market dynamics. Layer-2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and improved scalability enhance altcoin utility. These improvements could eventually support broader adoption and corresponding ETF growth, though likely on different timelines than Bitcoin. Investor education plays a crucial role in market development. As understanding of different blockchain technologies improves, investment decisions become more nuanced. This education process supports more sophisticated ETF products that can explain their value propositions clearly to potential investors. Conclusion Altcoin ETFs face substantial challenges matching Bitcoin ETF growth trajectories due to structural market differences, supply constraints, and varying institutional adoption patterns. While demand for diversified cryptocurrency exposure continues growing, fundamental limitations will likely maintain Bitcoin’s dominant position in ETF markets for the foreseeable future. The evolving regulatory landscape and technological developments may eventually alter these dynamics, but current analysis suggests altcoin ETFs will follow different, potentially slower growth pathways than their Bitcoin counterparts. FAQs Q1: What percentage of Bitcoin’s circulating supply do Bitcoin ETFs currently hold? Bitcoin exchange-traded funds currently hold approximately 7% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, according to recent analysis from BNY Mellon’s Global Head of ETFs. Q2: Why do altcoin ETFs struggle to hold significant portions of their underlying assets? Altcoin ETFs face supply constraints because their underlying markets are generally smaller and more fragmented than Bitcoin’s market, making large-scale accumulation more challenging and potentially more disruptive to market prices. Q3: How many cryptocurrency ETFs have launched in the United States this year? More than 40 cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds have launched in the United States this year alone, according to Ripple Labs President Monica Long, though their collective market share remains minimal compared to traditional ETF sectors. Q4: What factors make Bitcoin ETFs less sensitive to market trends than altcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs benefit from Bitcoin’s established position as digital gold, clearer regulatory treatment, broader institutional acceptance, and more mature market infrastructure, all of which reduce sensitivity to short-term market fluctuations compared to altcoin funds. Q5: How might wider adoption of crypto ETFs affect corporate participation? Wider adoption of cryptocurrency ETFs could accelerate market participation from corporations and institutions by providing regulated, familiar investment vehicles for gaining exposure to digital assets as part of broader financial strategies and treasury management approaches.

Franklin Templeton, an asset management firm handling over $1.6 trillion worth of assets, used a recent post on the social media platform X to explain why it is going deep into XRP as an asset, while also drawing attention to its Spot exchange-traded product, XRPZ. This interesting comment is part of a growing institutional confidence in XRP and the XRP Ledger. Franklin Templeton’s Strategic Entry With A Spot XRP ETF Franklin Templeton’s arrival in the XRP ETF space is one of the most significant endorsements of the token from a legacy financial institution. The firm launched the Franklin XRP Trust, trading under ticker XRPZ on the NYSE Arca in late November, offering investors regulated exposure to the digital asset without the operational complexity of holding the token directly.

Analysts Reveal What To Expect The fund is structured as a grantor trust that holds XRP and calculates its net asset value daily based on established reference rates, with custody provided by Coinbase Custody Trust Company and administration by BNY Mellon. Recent comments from leading voices at the fund manager reveal that the decision to launch a Spot XRP ETF is due to their strong belief in XRP and the XRP Ledger. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, highlighted the XRP Ledger’s designed capability for real-time, low-cost settlement and efficient cross-border payments. Furthermore, he noted that the altcoin’s market capitalization and role in global value transfer make it an important component worth regulated exposure for investors with a broad portfolio. The firm’s broader digital asset suite already includes Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and XRP was the latest to join this year. Franklin Templeton traces its roots back to 1947 and has built a reputation of trillions in equity, fixed income, and multi-asset investments in markets all around the world. Its move into crypto ETFs, now encompassing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP exposure, is part of many established asset managers now actively engaging in the crypto industry. Performance And Market Reception Of XRPZ Since Launch Several issuers received clearance for Spot XRP ETFs in 2025, making it possible for institutions and everyday investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrencies through regulated means. Since their debut in November, the Spot ETFs, including XRPZ, have attracted meaningful capital flows.

His analysis, delivered during a recent Schwab Network interview, directly links Federal Reserve monetary policies to potential cryptocurrency market strength, providing a data-driven counterpoint to recent market volatility. Bitcoin 2026 Forecast: Decoding the Macroeconomic Drivers Rick Wurster’s forecast hinges on identifiable monetary policy trends rather than speculative hype. He specifically cited three interconnected factors during his interview. First, he referenced the potential resumption of quantitative easing (QE) programs. Second, he analyzed the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying activities. Finally, he pointed to weakening demand for U.S. Treasury securities. These elements collectively suggest an environment of increased liquidity and potential currency devaluation pressures. Historically, such conditions have driven institutional and retail investors toward alternative stores of value. Consequently, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature position it as a potential beneficiary. This analysis provides a clear, cause-and-effect framework for the 2026 outlook. Quantitative Easing and Its Historical Impact on Digital Assets Quantitative easing represents a central bank’s large-scale purchase of government bonds and other financial assets. This process injects new money directly into the economy. The primary goal is to lower interest rates and increase lending. However, a significant secondary effect is the expansion of the monetary base. Following the 2008 financial crisis, prolonged QE coincided with rising institutional interest in Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ narrative gained traction. Similarly, the expansive monetary response during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 preceded a major bull market in cryptocurrencies. Wurster’s commentary suggests a belief that similar policy responses to future economic stress could replicate this dynamic. Therefore, monitoring Federal Reserve balance sheet movements becomes crucial for crypto investors. Expert Analysis: From Traditional Finance to Crypto Rick Wurster’s perspective carries weight due to Charles Schwab’s position as a cornerstone of American retail investing. The firm manages trillions in client assets. His shift from a traditionally cautious stance on crypto to a specific, forward-looking analysis signals evolving institutional acceptance. This is not an isolated opinion. For instance, other macro analysts have drawn parallels between Treasury market dynamics and crypto volatility. When demand for U.S. debt weakens, the government may face higher borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve could then intervene with supportive measures. This sequence often devalues the dollar’s purchasing power over time. Assets with verifiable scarcity, like Bitcoin, historically attract capital in such scenarios. Wurster’s statement formalizes this chain of reasoning from a mainstream financial leader. The Federal Reserve’s Role in Shaping Crypto Markets The Federal Reserve’s dual mandate focuses on maximum employment and stable prices. Its tools include the federal funds rate and asset purchases. When the Fed engages in bond-buying programs, it increases the money supply. This activity can suppress yields on traditional safe-haven assets like Treasurys. Investors seeking returns or inflation hedges must then look elsewhere. Bitcoin’s performance has shown sensitivity to these liquidity conditions. The table below outlines key Fed policy phases and concurrent Bitcoin performance: Period Fed Policy Stance BTC Price Trend 2020-2021 Highly Accommodative (QE, near-zero rates) Strong Bull Market 2022-2023 Contractionary (Rate Hikes, Quantitative Tightening) Bear Market/Consolidation 2024-2025* Pivot to Cautious Easing Recovery & Increased Institutional Adoption *Current period as of April 2025. Wurster’s 2026 prediction assumes a continuation or intensification of accommodative policies to address economic conditions. Understanding the U.S. Treasury Demand Dynamic Weak demand for U.S. Treasurys is a complex but critical piece of Wurster’s thesis. Major traditional buyers include: Foreign Governments: Nations like Japan and China have historically been large holders. Domestic Banks: Regulatory requirements dictate significant holdings. The Federal Reserve: The Fed itself is a massive holder via its balance sheet. Pension & Mutual Funds: These institutions seek safe, income-generating assets. If demand from these entities falters, interest rates must rise to attract buyers. Higher government borrowing costs can slow economic growth. To prevent this, the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to step in as a buyer of last resort. This action is essentially a form of monetary financing, which many economists view as inflationary. In an inflationary environment, hard-capped assets like Bitcoin, with its 21 million coin limit, become theoretically more attractive. This mechanistic view underpins the logical connection between Treasury auctions and cryptocurrency valuations. Conclusion Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster’s 2026 Bitcoin forecast provides a macroeconomic roadmap rooted in monetary policy analysis. His statement connects established Federal Reserve actions—quantitative easing and bond-buying—to potential capital flows into decentralized digital assets. This perspective elevates the discussion from pure speculation to a debate about fiscal and monetary responses to global economic trends. While market volatility persists in the short term, Wurster’s analysis highlights the importance of monitoring central bank balance sheets and Treasury market health. Ultimately, his outlook suggests that Bitcoin’s long-term valuation may be less about technological adoption alone and more about its evolving role within the broader global financial system. FAQs Q1: What exactly did the Charles Schwab CEO say about Bitcoin? Rick Wurster stated that the macroeconomic environment is expected to become more favorable for Bitcoin by 2026. He specifically cited factors like quantitative easing, Federal Reserve bond-buying, and weak U.S. Treasury demand as key drivers for this potential shift. Q2: How does quantitative easing (QE) potentially help Bitcoin? Quantitative easing increases the money supply, which can lead to currency devaluation or inflation concerns over time. Bitcoin, with its algorithmically limited supply, is often viewed by some investors as a hedge against this loss of purchasing power, potentially increasing demand. Q3: Is Charles Schwab allowing Bitcoin trading? As of April 2025, Charles Schwab does not offer direct cryptocurrency trading to its clients. However, it offers access to Bitcoin-related financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs through its brokerage platform, reflecting a growing integration of crypto assets within traditional finance. Q4: Why is demand for U.S. Treasurys important for cryptocurrency prices? Weak demand for U.S. government debt can force higher interest rates or require the Federal Reserve to intervene with purchases. Both outcomes can influence inflation expectations and investor appetite for alternative, non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin. Q5: Should investors change their strategy based on this 2026 forecast? Forecasts from financial leaders provide valuable context but are not financial advice. Investors should consider such macro analyses as one part of a diversified research strategy, aligning any decisions with their individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial goals.

Peter Schiff Thinks So,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-disqualifying-strategy-from-the-sp-500-peter-schiff-thinks-so/,cryptonews,"Peter Schiff has once again criticized Strategy’s Bitcoin-heavy corporate approach, raising fresh questions about whether the company’s performance would even qualify it for inclusion in the S&P 500. In a post on X, the economist argued that if Strategy were part of the benchmark index, its 47.5% decline in 2025 would place it among the worst performers of the year. Strategy isn’t in the S&P 500. But if it were, its 47.5% decline in 2025 would make it the 6th worst-performing stock in the index. @Saylor claims the best thing a company can do is buy Bitcoin. Well, that’s basically all $MSTR did, and the strategy destroyed shareholder value. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 31, 2025 Schiff said the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has come at the expense of shareholders, adding that Strategy’s stock collapse undercuts claims that buying Bitcoin is the best possible corporate strategy. Even in a Bullish Year, Some S&P 500 Stocks Crashed The comments arrive against the backdrop of a strong year for the broader U.S. equity market. The S&P 500 ended 2025 up about 17.3%, following gains of 23.3% in 2024 and 24.2% in 2023. Source: Google Finance While the index as a whole posted solid returns, performance within it was uneven. Several large-cap stocks suffered steep losses due to company-specific setbacks and shifting market conditions. Fiserv was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2025, finishing the year down roughly 70% after missing earnings expectations, cutting guidance, and facing client complaints. The Trade Desk followed closely with a decline of around 68%, pressured by slower revenue growth, rising competition from larger technology firms, and executive departures. Source: Google Finance Sarepta Therapeutics fell more than 80% after patient deaths and regulatory warnings related to its gene therapy treatments. Other laggards included Deckers Outdoor, Gartner, and Lululemon Athletica, all of which lost more than 50% during the year amid weaker forecasts, restructuring efforts, or prolonged growth challenges. MSTR’s Bitcoin Strategy Delivers Gains, But Stock Suffers in 2025 Strategy, which trades under the ticker MSTR, is not a member of the S&P 500, but its 2025 performance drew comparisons because of its scale and volatility. The stock began the year trading near $300 and surged in the first quarter, gaining about 50% as Bitcoin prices climbed, as it reached an annual high of $457.22 on July 16, 2025. That rally reversed sharply in the second half of the year as Bitcoin pulled back and broader risk sentiment shifted. By late September, the stock had erased its year-to-date gains. The decline deepened into the fourth quarter, and on December 31, MSTR hit an annual low of $151.42 before closing slightly higher at $151.95. The stock ended the year down about 49.35%, making it the worst performer in the Nasdaq-100 for 2025. Despite the stock’s slide, Strategy continued to expand its Bitcoin holdings. As of late December, the company held 672,497 BTC, acquired at an average cost of about $75,000 per coin. At current prices near $87,800, those holdings are valued at roughly $59 billion, leaving the firm with an unrealized gain of about 17%. The company disclosed another purchase on December 29 , buying 1,229 bitcoin for approximately $108.8 million using proceeds from its ongoing at-the-market stock offering. Executive chairman Michael Saylor said the firm’s Bitcoin yield for 2025 stood at 23.2%. Bitcoin or Business Model? The Real Barrier to Strategy’s S&P 500 Entry Bitcoin itself is not disqualifying Strategy from the S&P 500, but the way the company is structured around the asset remains a central issue. Strategy met the index’s core quantitative requirements in late 2025, including market capitalization and profitability, after reporting large net income driven by Bitcoin gains . However, inclusion in the S&P 500 is not automatic, as the final decisions rest with a committee that prioritizes operating businesses over investment-style vehicles. The committee has shown reluctance to add companies whose valuation is dominated by treasury assets rather than products or services. Analysts argue that Strategy now resembles a Bitcoin proxy, similar to a closed-end fund, which is an ineligible structure under index rules. This differs from firms like Tesla or Block, which hold Bitcoin but generate revenue from diverse operations. Historically, steep stock declines do not disqualify companies, as many S&P 500 members have recovered from major drawdowns. Even sharp price increases do not ensure entry, as the committee evaluates sustainability, volatility, and business fundamentals before listing.

The debate matters because growing ETF access and corporate buying now sit alongside macro pressure and heavy derivatives trading, creating a setup where large moves are possible but difficult to sustain. Analysts Map Out Bitcoin’s Most Likely 2026 Path An assessment shared by XWIN Research Japan described Bitcoin’s current structure as a high-volatility range rather than a clear uptrend or downtrend. According to the firm, long-term factors such as limited supply and ETF adoption still support the asset, but macro uncertainty, U.S. midterm election risk, and futures-led trading continue to cap follow-through. Their base case places Bitcoin in a broad $80,000 to $140,000 band for 2026, with $90,000 to $120,000 acting as the main trading zone. This view contrasts with more optimistic outlooks, including Dragonfly partner Haseeb Qureshi’s take that the flagship crypto could climb above $150,000 by the end of 2026, even as its share of the wider digital asset market slips. He argued that capital rotation into other large networks would signal a healthier market, not weakness. Still, other commentators warned that short-lived rallies could trap buyers before another leg lower, with downside targets stretching toward the low $70,000s. Price Action Shows Compression, Not Conviction Bitcoin’s recent price behavior supports the idea of balance rather than momentum. At the time of writing, it was changing hands at just under $88,000, down roughly 1% in the last 24 hours but slightly higher on the week. Over the past month, gains sit near 2%, while the one-year performance remains negative at about 6%. These modest shifts place Bitcoin in line with a broader market that has struggled to pick a clear direction. Technically, traders are still focused on a tightening triangle pattern that has contained the price for about six weeks. Commentary posted on X by the Swing Trader in late December pointed to potential moves of about 15% once the range breaks, which would place upside near $100,000 or downside closer to $75,000. Until then, liquidity appears evenly split, with buyers stepping in near $87,000 and sellers active below $90,000. Despite the quiet tape, large holders have kept buying, with public companies now controlling well over 1 million BTC, which is about 5% of the total supply. Strategy’s latest purchase, at the tail end of last year, lifted its holdings to 672,497 BTC, even as its stock lagged Bitcoin itself. When combined, the data paints a picture of a market that is supported but cautious. According to XWIN, for 2026, the most realistic expectation may not be dramatic new highs, but extended trading between clearly defined limits, punctuated by brief bursts of volatility when macro or ETF flows shift.

The agency said Chairman Michael S. Selig made the announcement and noted Zaidi’s long history with the regulator. Bitcoin: Experienced Regulator Returns Zaidi first joined the commission in 2010 and served in various roles through 2019. He spent his last two years at the agency as Director of the Division of Market Oversight, a post he took on in 2017. Reports have disclosed that in that role he helped shape the policy steps that led to the launch of regulated Bitcoin futures in the US during US President Donald Trump’s first term. I’m grateful for Amir Zaidi’s willingness to return to the @CFTC as chief of staff. Amir was instrumental in the historic launch of CFTC-regulated bitcoin futures contracts during @POTUS President Trump’s first term. With Congress poised to send digital asset market structure… https://t.co/Oft6NLc4Uv — Mike Selig (@MichaelSelig) December 31, 2025 What He Did Outside Government After leaving the commission in 2019, Zaidi moved to the private sector. He joined TP ICAP as Global Head of Compliance in September 2019, a role in which he oversaw a large compliance team and reported to senior legal leadership at the firm. That experience gave him direct exposure to broker-dealer operations and market structure issues. Why The Move Matters Based on reports , Zaidi returns at a time when Congress and federal agencies are focused on clearer rules for digital assets. Some lawmakers are expected to advance a market structure bill in early January that could give agencies more defined roles over crypto trading and derivatives. That timing puts a spotlight on the CFTC’s leadership choices. A Look At His Track Record Zaidi’s years at the commission included work on exchange oversight, swap data, and market monitoring. The TP ICAP materials describe him as having led a team of about 90 staff across multiple offices while at the CFTC, an operational detail tied to his DMO role. That mix of policy and hands-on management is what the agency emphasized when announcing his return. Regulators will likely move quickly to set priorities for 2026. Market participants and lawmakers will watch how the new chief of staff helps the CFTC coordinate with other agencies and respond to incoming legislation.

Fewer coins on exchanges usually signal accumulation as price hits new lows. This long-term accumulation is mainly supported by ETFs, which have now recorded over $1.4B in inflows since launch. That represents almost 0.75% of the total supply in a couple of months. Source: sharply declining XRP exchange reserves over the past months on Binance / CryptoQuant One metric is not enough, but this holding behavior is better explained when you look at velocity . It is currently near the lower end of its historical range. Velocity describes how XRP supply circulates on the XRP Ledger. Velocity this low indicates it is barely moving, which has historically been seen during consolidation phases. If this were a panic or capitulation phase, you would see high velocity due to heavy redistribution of coins. Xrp (XRP) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time As we head into 2026, the XRP price is still holding above its 14-month support at $1.80. Out of everything, this might be the most bullish signal. XRP Price Prediction: Explosive Price Action Coming? XRP is closing out the year trading near $1.85 at the time of writing. It saw strong momentum in 2025, breaking above $3.40 before the broader market declined. On the back of Ripple’s momentum in 2025, the company looks well-positioned for further growth in 2026. Analysts from banking giant Standard Chartered have predicted XRP could skyrocket more than 300% to over $8 in 2026, driven by demand from spot XRP ETFs and the regulatory clarity the asset now has. There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. If that level holds, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 48, which leaves room for a short-term rally toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raised 30M: New Milestone While XRP sits in consolidation mode and exchange supply keeps drying up, Bitcoin Hyper is starting to stand out as one of the more aggressive plays heading into 2026. As majors like XRP stabilize and ETFs absorb supply, traders often start looking further out on the risk curve for asymmetric upside. That is exactly where Bitcoin Hyper positions itself. It is built around the Bitcoin narrative but designed for higher beta moves, making it attractive during periods when the broader market is coiling rather than trending. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $30M, signaling strong early conviction even as overall market momentum cools. On top of that, its staking rewards sit around 39% APY , which encourages holders to lock in supply instead of flipping short-term moves. That kind of structure tends to matter once risk appetite returns. As XRP defends its long-term support and waits for the next catalyst, Bitcoin Hyper is doing what early cycle winners often do: building quietly during low-volatility phases before the market shifts gears. If 2026 delivers the kind of expansion many expect, projects that were accumulated during consolidation periods are usually the first to move.
