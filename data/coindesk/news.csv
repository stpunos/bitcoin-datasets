However, while the pressure is clearly visible, artificial intelligence ( AI ) models suggest that the cryptocurrency may somewhat stabilize this month and maybe see some gains. Some early signs of this stabilization may already be evident, with Bitcoin trading at around $89,500 at the time of writing, up nearly 2% on the day due to a supportive technical picture. Bitcoin price reclaims key technical levels A few of the core momentum measures have also strengthened, led by the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 70.4, signaling firm upside momentum. The MACD value of 319.5 likewise remains positive. Trend strength readings further reinforced the picture. For instance, the Average Directional Index ( ADX ) rose to 65.2, a level typically associated with bullish directional moves. Similarly, a positive Rate of Change ( ROC ) at 1.308 indicates that bulls are firmly in control of order flow. However, it must be noted that the white/red Stochastic Oscillator, which measures price momentum over the past nine periods smoothed across six periods, is at 99.2, suggesting a consolidation period or a pullback toward short-term moving averages is possible. AI Bitcoin price prediction for January 2026 With the technical picture hinting at potential short-term upticks, Finbold used its AI-driven price prediction tool to see where BTC could sit by the end of the month. To generate its forecast, the model aggregates results from ChatGPT , Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4, pointing to a range of potential outcomes. Finbold AI BTC price forecast. Source: Finbold The average Bitcoin price target for the end of January came out at $91,900, implying a 2.67% upside from current levels. Claude Sonnet 4 gave the most bullish figure, projecting a potential 6.97% rally, while Gemini 2.5 Flash actually suggested the price could go down 0.07% downside. ChatGPT was bullish but conservative, arguing for a 1.1% gain. Finbold AI BTC technical analysis.

In other words, short-term momentum currently favors buyers, who are closely watching whether Bitcoin can defend support around $88,319, the 61.8% Fibonacci level .

Echoing the views of several other prominent voices in finance – notably of Robert Kiyosaki – McGlone opined on January 1 that 2026 will be a year of volatility and crisis but also one of opportunity for the ‘tactically orientated’ to make a fortune. Base Case Update 2026 – Dope-Sniffing Dogs May Prevail: – Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000 – President Trump faces similarly poor timing as Herbert Hoover – A third down year for US stocks since 2008 – Cryptos to lead the next… — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) January 1, 2026 Will the Great Depression 2.0 start in 2026? Though measured in tone, the Commodity Strategist hinted he expects 2026 to be a crisis year by providing a historical parallel. Specifically, he opined that President Donald Trump shall suffer from poor timing, much like President Herbert Hoover. Hoover famously entered the Oval Office in 1929, mere months before the Great Depression started. McGlone provided both evidence for his assumptions and issued several stark predictions. Specifically, he identified gold’s grabbing of alpha – its ability to outperform the market – as a major warning sign evident through much of 2025. Gold grabbing alpha in 2025 was a warning – especially vs. falling crude oil Unfortunately for investors hoping to benefit from the precious metals boom, the market expert also opined that gold, silver , and most similar assets will suffer from, in his words, ‘went up-too-much’ dangers in 2026. Similarly, McGlone identified T-Bonds – the debt securities of the American government – as the stars of the market, as he estimates they will be the ones to ‘take alpha’ from the yellow metal in the ongoing year. Will the crypto market bloom in 2026? Mike McGlone simultaneously gave a word of warning to cryptocurrency investors as he forecasted that a Bitcoin ( BTC ) fall to $50,000 is more likely than a rally back to $100,000. As evidence, he cited that Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the digital assets market – dropped 19% last year. Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000. Cryptos to lead the next post-inflation deflation cycle due to wealth creation reversion.

According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, a bearish market sentiment has taken hold over the past few months, with some market watchers claiming the top of the four-year market cycle has already passed. The crypto market analytics platform believes investor sentiment has changed due to Bitcoin’s muted end-of-year performance, but the lines between traditional financial assets and crypto are also blurred, as companies experiment with new forms of tokenization. Delphi market analysis: Equity is moving onchain Per Delphi’s 2026 outlook , the distinction between tokens and traditional equity is now more difficult to define since companies like California-based Securitize are filing for initial public offerings (IPOs) while simultaneously looking into tokenization. Crypto is facing a token identity crisis. The lines are blurring on both sides. Equity is moving onchain with companies like Securitize filing for IPOs. Tokens are becoming more equity like through MetaDAO's ownership coins and Uniswap's fee switch. Customer Acquisition Cost… pic.twitter.com/CgjHQuHq8q — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) January 1, 2026 Some crypto projects, such as MetaDAO have launched ownership tokens that mimic how traditional financial firms issue shares, and decentralized platform Uniswap has added fee switches, much like how equity-like returns are for token holders. Among the upcoming token models is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tokens, which are distinct to equity-like tokens or governance mechanisms because they fund user acquisition at scale. PayPal is one of the many companies moving forward with tokenization, having spent over $60 million in venture capital cash on incentives to begin its quest for digital assets. Yet, per Delphi, CAC tokens could achieve comparable results through token emissions, where early adopters can receive larger rewards that taper as the network grows. The analysts cited Worldcoin as the best example of this model, reportedly spreading over 500 million WLD tokens to onboard users and expanding the footprint of its World App. According to data from Dune analytics, the project crossed $3.8 billion market cap level during the bull market run in mid-2025, although its token’s price traded below $2.5 in the whole of last year. US regulatory clarity opens crypto market to institutions Changes in regulations have made things much clearer for the crypto industry, especially in the US and Europe. POTUS signed an executive order in the US to encourage responsible innovation and the use of stablecoins backed by the dollar. However, he also clearly said that a CBDC was not an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went a step ahead to support experimentation by issuing no-action letters for the Depository Trust Company’s tokenization pilot and the Fuse Crypto Token. US Congress is in support of crypto-friendly candidates for 2026 midterms. This comes against the backdrop of discussing the CLARITY Act , which places crypto regulatory oversight in the hands of the CFTC. Although some economists believe there are still some hiccups in country-by-country jurisdictional rules, MiCA has been protecting investors and has made the environment more palatable for institutions to join in. Crypto market mulls optimism as Bitcoin trades just below $90,000 Despite the ongoing gloomy outlook, there is a perception that the industry has grown enough to handle downturns and escape historic crypto winters. “It’s more of an industry now. So if there is a winter or a downturn, it’s not going to be a complete lights-out moment,” Kaiko senior researcher Adam Morgan McCarthy told NPR. The crypto derivatives market has approximately $2.2 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options reaching expiration, with the former taking up $1.87 billion in notional value currently outstanding. At the time of this reporting, the king coin is trading at around $88,970, just above the $88,000 “max pain” point, where option writers may start counting heavy losses. Coinglass open interest data shows 14,194 call contracts have been placed against 6,806 puts, which could mean hodlers are bracing for a price comeback upwards of $90,000.

Despite the improvement in prices, trading activity remains relatively soft, with 24-hour volume near $70.6 billion, pointing to selective participation rather than broad risk-on behavior. TLDR: The crypto market cap rose about 1.4% over the past 24 hours to roughly $3.1 trillion; Major coins traded mixed but mostly higher, with BTC near $88,960; Altcoins outperformed, with Pepe, Monad, and Holoworld posting double-digit gains; CryptoQuant says Bitcoin may already be two months into a bear market; Bitcoin’s key support is at $88,000 and resistance near $92,000; Ethereum could rally toward $3,200 and has downside risk back to $2,800; Market sentiment remains cautious, with the Fear and Greed Index at 34; There was no US spot ETF data on Jan. 1 due to market closure; Crypto hack losses fell sharply in December, down 60% month-on-month to about $76 million. Crypto Winners & Losers Performance across the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization is mixed, though most large caps are holding near recent ranges. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $88,960, little changed on the day, but still up about 1.5% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is slightly lower on the hour but higher on the day, trading near $3,024 after gaining roughly 1.6% in the last 24 hours and extending its weekly advance. BNB (BNB) is among the stronger large-cap performers, rising about 1% to $867, while Solana (SOL) is up roughly 2.5% on the day, trading near $127.3 and outperforming several peers. XRP (XRP) is modestly higher, gaining around 1.7% to $1.87, while TRON (TRX) has added about 0.3%, holding near $0.285. Dogecoin (DOGE) stands out as one of the stronger movers in the top 10, jumping more than 8% to trade around $0.128. Outside the majors, activity is more pronounced. Among trending tokens, Lighter has gained nearly 8%, while Pepe is up close to 25%, extending its recent momentum. Monad is also higher, posting gains of more than 17%. Among the top gainers overall, Holoworld leads with a surge of over 30%, followed closely by River and Clash of Lilliput , both posting gains above 25% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin may have already slipped into a bear market roughly two months ago, according to CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, who points to a cluster of technical and on-chain indicators that turned bearish in early November and have yet to recover.

Bitcoin Holds $88K as 2026 Opens With Light Volume and Rising Risk Appetite Bitcoin hovered near $88,000 on Friday as markets eased into the first trading session of 2026, with holiday-thinned volumes keeping price moves contained. Early risk appetite was most visible in Asia, where Hong Kong and South Korea equities advanced on the back of strength in technology and semiconductor stocks, while closures in Japan and mainland China limited regional liquidity. Bitcoin held near $88k in thin holiday trade as 2026 opened, with Asian stock gains lifting risk appetite and traders watching for fresh crypto momentum. #AsiaMarketOpen #CryptoMarketUpdate https://t.co/XdaNXEykFP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 2, 2026 Crypto traders are watching for signs that Bitcoin can turn this calm into upside momentum after a choppy year-end. Mudrex analyst Akshat Siddhant said long-term holder supply has turned positive for the first time in months, rising by about 10,700 BTC, while continued exchange outflows point to reduced selling pressure. He noted that a break above $89,500 could open the door to a move toward $100,000, with $87,000 acting as key support. Broader markets echoed the cautious optimism, with US equity futures edging higher as enthusiasm around big tech and AI carried over from late 2025. Attention now shifts to US economic data delayed by the government shutdown, Federal Reserve rate expectations, and political risk tied to President Donald Trump’s expected decision on the next Fed chair. Meanwhile, gold and silver extended strong gains, and the dollar began the year weaker after its steepest annual drop in eight years. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $88,980, stabilizing after a volatile end to 2025. The chart shows BTC rebounding from a late-November low around $85,000, followed by a period of sideways consolidation through December. From a technical standpoint, $88,000–$88,500 has emerged as a key near-term support zone. A sustained hold above this area could allow BTC to test the upper boundary of the range near $90,000, with further resistance sitting around $92,000. A decisive break above that level would be needed to shift near-term momentum back in favor of bulls. On the downside, a loss of $88,000 would likely bring $85,000 back into focus. Below that, a deeper pullback could open the door toward the $82,000–$83,000 region, which previously acted as a demand zone during the November selloff. Ethereum, meanwhile, is trading around $3,024, showing early signs of stabilization after a sharp multi-month decline. The chart highlights a clear downtrend from September highs above $4,500, followed by a steep breakdown in November and choppy recovery attempts throughout December. ETH recently bounced from lows near $2,800, but upside momentum remains tentative. For ETH, the $3,000–$3,050 area now acts as a critical pivot range. Holding above this zone could allow a move toward $3,200, with further resistance near $3,400 if momentum improves. On the downside, failure to defend $3,000 may send ETH back toward $2,800, with additional support around $2,700. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains cautious, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index still lodged in the fear zone. According to CoinMarketCap data shown in the chart, the index currently reads 34, underscoring a hesitant mood among investors despite recent stabilization in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. While sentiment has improved modestly from 27 last week, it remains well below neutral levels and far from the optimism seen earlier in 2025. The index is also sharply higher than last month’s extreme fear reading of 16, suggesting panic has eased, but confidence has yet to return. There is no US spot ETF flow data for Jan. 1 due to the New Year market closure. The latest available figures reflect Dec. 31, the final trading day of 2025. On that session, US Bitcoin spot ETFs ended the year with net outflows of $348.1 million, according to SoSoValue, despite solid activity with $2.83 billion in daily trading volume. Outflows were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $99.05 million leave the fund, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $46.58 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also continued to bleed assets, recording $69.09 million in outflows, while Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB posted $76.53 million in net redemptions. Even with the daily pullback, cumulative net inflows into US BTC spot ETFs remain strong at $56.61 billion, with total net assets of $113.29 billion, representing about 6.47% of Bitcoin’s market cap. US Ethereum spot ETFs also closed the year under pressure, posting $72.06 million in net outflows on Dec. 31, alongside $808.1 million in trading volume. BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, seeing $21.51 million leave the fund, while Grayscale’s ETH product recorded $31.98 million in net redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH also posted smaller outflows of $2.22 million, reflecting broad-based caution across issuers. Despite the day’s weakness, cumulative net inflows for US ETH spot ETFs stand at $12.33 billion, with total net assets of $17.95 billion, roughly 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, crypto-related losses from hacks and cybersecurity exploits fell sharply in December, dropping 60% month-on-month to about $76 million.

56728169,651809,1767353446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56728169.jpeg,Did Saylor’s Bitcoin Bet Fail? Strategy’s $17.5 Billion Loss Numbers Stun Community,https://bitcoinist.com/did-saylors-bitcoin-bet-fail/,"Market expert Andy has drawn attention to a significant loss that Michael Saylor’s Strategy took in the last quarter of 2025, mainly due to its Bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, renowned economist Peter Schiff also highlighted how the MSTR stock would have been one of the worst-performing stocks if the company were in the S&P 500. Michael Saylor’s Strategy Posts $17.5 Billion Loss Amid Bitcoin Decline In an X post , Andy noted that Saylor’s Strategy will report GAAP earnings for a fourth-quarter loss of $17.5 billion in 2025, which ranks as the largest quarterly loss in history. This follows Bitcoin’s decline in the fourth quarter, with the leading crypto dropping below $100,000. This caused this loss for the company, given its BTC exposure. Strategy’s Bitcoin exposure also contributed to the MSTR stock’s massive decline last year as BTC fell. The stock recorded a 2025 loss of almost 50%, dropping to the low $150 from its high of around $450. In an X post , Schiff noted that the stock’s decline in 2025 would make it the 6th-worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 if Saylor’s company were in the index. The economist again criticized Saylor’s Bitcoin model, stating that buying BTC was basically all the company did, which he claimed has destroyed shareholder value. However, it is worth noting that Strategy’s Bitcoin exposure contributed to the company’s strong Q2 and Q3 earnings last year. In Q2, the company recorded $14 billion in GAAP operating income, while it recorded $3.9 billion in the third quarter. Furthermore, MSTR stock has remained one of the best-performing assets since Saylor and Strategy adopted BTC in 2020. The stock is up over 260% in the last five years. Meanwhile, Schiff stated that the MSTR stock will likely deliver even worse returns in 2026 than in 2025. He believes this would happen because of Bitcoin, which the economist expects to drop more this year than it did in 2025, putting stress on the MSTR shares in the process. Reason To Still Be Bullish On Strategy and MSTR Market expert Adam Livingston stated that he remains bullish on Michael Saylor’s Strategy and MSTR stock because the company is hedging against inflation with Bitcoin rather than holding cash. Livingston noted that the real risk isn’t the volatility with the MSTR stock or market movement, but inflation, which continues to erode. The expert further declared that Bitcoin changes the risk equation, thanks to its scarcity, which helps protect companies like Strategy and individuals against ‘money printing.’ Interestingly, Livingston suggested that Saylor’s company could become one of the most valuable in the world, thanks to its BTC exposure . He noted that long-term purchasing power is the objective, and this is where he expects the company to stand out.",Bitcoin News|Adam Livingston|ANDY|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|GAAP|michael saylor|mstr|Peter Schiff|S&P 500|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-02T12:09:04.072054+00:00

EWCL announced a $70 million funding deal with Cango in June 2025. HCW analysts have a $3 price target for CANG while Greenridge analysts assigned a $4 valuation projection. Cango Inc. was up more than 3% in pre-market ahead of its first full trading day after news that Enduring Wealth Capital Limited (EWCL) made a fresh $10.5 million commitment to the firm’s Bitcoin mining business with operating bases across over 40 sites in North America, the Middle East, South America, and East Africa. According to public disclosures seen by Cryptopolitan, EWCL will subscribe for an additional 7 million Class B ordinary shares in cash at $1.50 per share, which is 20% above the firm’s baseline share price of $1.25 and closing market price of $1.36. Market observers often attribute this level of oversubscription as a bullish signal for future returns not yet reflected in a business’s performance. EWCL backs Cango to lead changing BTC mining sector According to Cango’s press release, the proposed investment, which is expected to close in January, subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the requisite approval by the New York Stock Exchange, EWCL’s shareholding in the Bitcoin miner is expected to increase from approximately 2.81% to approximately 4.69% of the total outstanding shares. Correspondingly, EWCL’s voting power is expected to rise from approximately 36.68% to approximately 49.61% of the total voting power of Cango’s outstanding shares. The EWCL management team is expected to continue to provide core resources for Cango’s 50 EH/s operations and AI transformation. Earlier in June, EWCL completed an aggregate purchase of 10,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, a total purchase price of up to $70 million securities purchase agreement with Cango. This latest cash injection also boosts Cango’s cash reserves and provides the liquidity to pursue its 2026 AI/HPC expansion. Paul Yu, CEO and Director of Cango, commented on EWCL betting on Cango to the tune of $10.5 million to maintain profitability into the future. “The increased investment from EWCL is a powerful vote of confidence in our strategic roadmap. The strengthened alignment with a major shareholder who thoroughly understands our vision enables us to execute with greater certainty and ambition. In 2026, we will continue to strengthen our Bitcoin mining operational capabilities, with a focus on improving hashrate efficiency, upgrading our mining fleet, and selectively acquiring strategic mining assets.” Cango has a long runway Despite the 20% oversubscription for the deal, analysts still believe Cango’s 7,400+ BTC reserves, 50 EH/s fleet, and $450.20 million market cap are still severely undervalued, backing the firm’s chain-to-cloud strategy to take off. Earlier this month, Greenridge analysts assigned Cango a $4 target price even before the announcement of its latest deal with EWCL. HCW analysts made a less bullish case, foreseeing a 100% gain to $3 as more probable for the CANG stock. The impetus for those bullish calls came from the strong numbers that Cango published in its Q3 2025 earnings report. Total revenue was up 60.6% at $224.6 million, with Bitcoin mining making up $220.9 million of the final count for the quarter. Cango’s operating income came in at $43.5 million, net income was $37.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2025 was $80.1 million. During the third quarter, Cango increased its total output by 37.5% and daily production by 36% compared to the second quarter of 2025, earning a total of 1,930.8 BTC for the quarter at a daily average of 21 BTC. The firm managed to couple its productivity boost with an average return of about $18,000 on every Bitcoin it mined during the quarter. As of the end of September 2025, Cango reported that it had mined 5,810 BTC throughout its lifetime. Other than the provision of fresh capital to accelerate its core growth initiatives, the timing of EWCL’s investment in Cango represents a level of conviction that is bucking a trend of BTC miners and their backers reevaluating their business models as profitability is no longer a forgone conclusion due to falling token prices, ballooning hashrates and reduced rewards for mining blocks. Less profitable outfits have simply jumped ship, repurposing their mining equipment for hyperscalers to run AI data centers due to the competition in the market. Cango is on track for long-term AI compute expansion goals Cango has progressed past its ADR program phase to transition to a direct listing on the NYSE, which is expected to unlock capital structure, corporate transparency, and strategic benefits for a firm with plans to expand to serve the growing demand for AI compute capacity. Notably, Cango has activated pilot projects in both integrated energy solutions and distributed AI computing since entering the digital asset space in November 2024, pursuing expansion opportunities ahead of the market squeezes that have forced contemporaries to sharply pivot their businesses. According to official Cango documents, the firm maintains a long-term vision to build a global, distributed AI compute grid powered by green energy. It also plans to operate multiple hubs and edge nodes as a utility-like provider of AI compute for multinationals and large‑scale AI applications. Commenting on the opportunity for future pivots, Yu said: “Beyond our core mining business, this capital also supports the parallel development of our strategic pillars in energy and AI compute. We are actively exploring and investing in synergistic opportunities in these areas as we build toward our long-term goal: establishing an integrated, global infrastructure platform capable of powering the future digital economy.”",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-02T12:09:04.072054+00:00

The analyst also stated this would form the macro bottom for the leading crypto, as it recovers from this bear market. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Drop To As Low As $25,000 In an X post, Crypto Whale stated that the monthly chart suggested that the Bitcoin price could form a macro bottom near $25,000 sometime in 2026. The analyst further remarked that if history rhymes, these deep retracements tend to mark long-term accumulation zones. He added that this doesn’t signify the end of the cycle but the reset before the next expansion. However, in another X post, Crypto Whale suggested that the Bitcoin price isn’t yet in a bear market, highlighting how the 2026 bull run is likely to unfold. He stated that this month, the crypto market will see a Bitcoin-led rally, while there will be a broad altcoin expansion in February. The analyst expects the bull trap to set in in March, which he predicts would lead to volatility and panic selling. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is Extremely Bearish Right Now Once that happens, Crypto Whale predicts that May will usher in the capitulation phase, while a full bear market confirmation will happen in June. This outlook for the Bitcoin price comes as research firm XWIN Research noted that BTC has not clearly entered a new bullish trend. The firm further stated that the crypto market remains in a high-volatility range environment, which is neither decisively bullish nor bearish. Meanwhile, XWIN Research raised the possibility that the Bitcoin price could drop to as low as $50,000. They stated that this could happen if recession risks intensify, with deleveraging and ETF outflows pushing the leading crypto below $80,000 and making $50,000 a possibility. BTC Death Cross Signals Drop To $38,000 In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez drew attention to a death cross, which has been recurring on the BTC weekly chart. The analyst noted that if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could record a similar 50% to 60% correction, dropping to as low as $38,000 in the process. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Decision Phase, But What Does It Mean For The Crypto Market? This death cross between the 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages is said to have occurred in September 2014, leading to a Bitcoin price correction of 67%. It also occurred in June 2018, March 2020, and January 2022, resulting in price corrections of 54%, 53%, and 64%, respectively. Martinez opined that the zone between $50,000 and $38,000 is starting to become interesting from a long-term spot accumulation standpoint. He added that the market will confirm the next move for the Bitcoin price in its own time. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $88,700, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

56727221,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1424798,1767351416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/56727221.jpeg,"Ripple’s (XRP) Next Big Move, Ethereum’s (ETH) Outlook for a Strong Year, and More: Bits Recap Jan 2",https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-xrp-next-big-move-ethereums-eth-outlook-for-a-strong-year-and-more-bits-recap-jan-2/,"Ripple’s native token has had a volatile week, with its price hovering between $1.80 and $1.90. The question now is whether the bulls can seize control and initiate a decisive move to the upside. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) have also endured substantial turbulence, and some analysts believe they could be gearing up for a solid start to the year. What’s Next for XRP? The asset’s price briefly exceeded $1.90 on December 29, but the bears intercepted the move and suppressed the valuation. As of this writing, it trades at around $1.88 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 2% increase on a daily scale. Several hours ago, the popular X user Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential indicator had flashed “a macro buy signal” on XRP, meaning a more significant rebound could be on the way. Prior to that, BitGuru argued that the asset is at a pivotal moment, which has historically led to a major rally. “XRP price is now compressing near key support after trend exhaustion. This is typically where smart money starts positioning early before the next directional move.” Meanwhile, the amount of XRP tokens stored on centralized platforms continues to decline. X user Niels revealed that exchange balances have fallen from 3.76 billion coins in October 2025 to approximately 1.6 billion as of the end of December. Such a development is usually seen as bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. ETH’s Path Ahead The second-largest cryptocurrency started the new year slightly below $3,000, but it reclaimed that psychological level several hours ago. According to X user Gerla, “a clean break” above that mark opens the door to a 15-20% move in the coming weeks. CyrilXBT chipped in, too. They noted that ETH has been testing the $3K zone numerous times recently and every time it sits around it long enough, “people get bored, call it dead… then it moves when no one’s ready.” The analyst assumed the following months could be highly beneficial for the asset, envisioning the rise to a new all-time high of around $7,000 and the explosion beyond $10,000 sometime next year. The market observer using the moniker JAVON MARKS is also bullish. They think ETH is capable of breaking multiple resistance points in the near future and surging to the specific target of $4,811.71. Once that level is exceeded, the price may skyrocket above $8,500, the analyst added. Renewed Bull Run or Pullback for BTC? The leading digital asset is also in the green today (January 2), with its price jumping past $89,000. Analyst The Swing Trader recently claimed that BTC has been forming “a very tight pennant” for the past six weeks, suggesting that breaking this pattern to the upside could lead to a pump above $100,000, while in the opposite case, it might result in a plunge toward $75,000. JAVON MARKS stands clearly on the bullish side, envisioning an ascent to $126,200, while Crypto GEMs predicted that the asset’s valuation could explode above $200,000 “soon.” At the same time, some analysts presented a more cautious thesis. X user Crypto Tony expects a pullback after the positive start to the year, whereas Ted believes every pump will be rejected until BTC breaks above $90K, citing “strong spot demand.” The post Ripple’s (XRP) Next Big Move, Ethereum’s (ETH) Outlook for a Strong Year, and More: Bits Recap Jan 2 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ethereum|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-02T12:09:04.072054+00:00

Could a definitive breakout take place as early as next week? Or is Bitcoin still traversing within its bear flag before the next big leg down? Can this upside push retest the $90,000 resistance? Source: TradingView As can be seen in the 4-hour chart, the $BTC price is in an up phase at the moment. This has taken the price clear of the major ascending trendline, but the bulls are having some trouble with resistance at $89,000 while the Stochastic RSI indicator lines on this time frame are becoming overbought. There is still probably room for the price to head up to the crucial $90,500 horizontal resistance level, but if it did get there, it is likely that it will be rejected once again. In fact, it might be argued that the $BTC price could be forming an ascending triangle, with $90,500 as the top, and with the major trendline ascending towards it. Is an ascending triangle forming? Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the potential ascending triangle. It may be a bit on the early side to call this, but as long as the $BTC price comes up to the resistance of the top of the triangle, and is rejected, this would probably confirm the pattern. It must however also be borne in mind that the price is in a bear flag (dashed mauve lines), so even if the $BTC price does break out of the ascending triangle, it would still be in that bear flag, potentially until well over $100,000. Strong breakout of the downtrend - bulls in control for now Source: TradingView The weekly view shows a strong breakout of the downtrend line and the falling wedge pattern. It can be seen that if the $BTC price can break through the $93,000 to $94,000 area, this would turn into major horizontal support, potentially setting the price for a big rally higher. At the bottom of the chart, the indicator lines are posturing for a cross back to the upside of the blue fast line over the orange slow line. If this is the case at the end of this week, next week could be a good one for the bulls. It just needs to be kept in mind that the price has been hammered down every time it looks as though it might escape the shackles of the resistances. Who knows if the market makers are ready to let the price fly just yet? One thing does look likely though, and that is the eventual big move will be to the upside.

Between January 1 and December 31, 2025, the value of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) holdings rose from $54.83 billion to $77.35 billion, representing a $22.52 billion increase, or a 41.07% annual gain, based on data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham . !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Bitcoin remained the core driver of the portfolio. Over the same period, BlackRock’s BTC holdings rose from approximately 552,550 BTC to 770,380 BTC, an increase of 217,830 BTC. In dollar terms, Bitcoin exposure grew from $51.16 billion to $67.14 billion, representing a $15.98 billion increase, or 31.24% year over year. Ethereum delivered the strongest relative growth. BlackRock’s ETH holdings expanded from around 1.07 million ETH to 3.48 million ETH, adding roughly 2.41 million ETH in 2025. The value of those holdings climbed from $3.59 billion to $10.21 billion, a gain of $6.62 billion, translating to a 184.40% increase over the year. The figures underscore not only sustained institutional demand for crypto assets, but also BlackRock’s tendency to deploy capital steadily through periods of consolidation rather than chasing short-term price surges. Q1 2025 crypto ETF inflows set the tone The year began amid choppy market conditions following the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. While prices fluctuated early in the quarter, ETF inflows consistently favored BlackRock’s iShares products , cementing the firm’s role as the dominant institutional gateway into crypto markets. By the end of the first quarter, BlackRock held approximately 575,860 BTC and 1.17 million ETH, with a combined crypto portfolio valued at $49.85 billion. The temporary dip in valuation reflected broader market volatility rather than reduced exposure, as accumulation continued beneath the surface. First half of 2025 Bitcoin leads while Ethereum builds Momentum accelerated in the first half of the year. From January 1 to June 30, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio grew by $23.91 billion, climbing from $54.77 billion to $78.67 billion. Bitcoin remained the backbone of the allocation, rising from $51.16 billion to $74.47 billion, a 31.3% increase. Ethereum also advanced, increasing by $678.95 million, from $3.53 billion to $4.21 billion, reflecting a more measured accumulation phase as institutional interest continued to develop. Ethereum drives BlackRock crypto portfolio growth in Q3 2025 The most dramatic growth occurred during the third quarter. From early July through September 30, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio surged to $102.09 billion, a 28% increase in just three months. While Bitcoin added nearly $11 billion in value over the period, Ethereum emerged as the fastest-growing component. ETH holdings jumped from $4.37 billion to $15.83 billion, a gain of more than 260%, highlighting rising institutional focus on Ethereum-linked yield, tokenization, and settlement use cases. BlackRock crypto holdings consolidate in Q4 2025 Finbold’s analysis shows that BlackRock’s $22.52 billion increase in crypto exposure during 2025 was driven by continued demand flowing through its spot exchange-traded funds. The Bitcoin and Ethereum tracked in this report reflect assets accumulated via BlackRock’s ETF platform, led by the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), as investors sought regulated access to digital assets throughout the year. Rather than signaling a proprietary shift by BlackRock itself, the data highlights how institutional and retail capital increasingly used the firm’s ETFs as a preferred gateway into crypto markets. Even as prices consolidated in the fourth quarter, inflows remained resilient, reinforcing the view that digital assets are being treated less as a short-term trade and more as a long-duration allocation within diversified portfolios.

Related Reading: Crypto Headed For A $10 Trillion Future? Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key Moreno pointed to the price sliding below its one-year moving average as the clearest technical confirmation, and he used that signal to argue a lower trading range may be on the path ahead. Bitcoin Technical Signals, Market Mood Moreno said a likely bottom could sit near the realized price, which he put in the $56,000–$60,000 band. That would mean a drawdown of roughly 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high — a drop that is large but smaller than past crashes that hit 70% or 80%. Market momentum is muted. Bitcoin began 2025 near $93,000, peaked at about $126,050 in October, and ended the year below where it started, according to CoinGecko. Trading hovered around $88,920 as of Friday, based on available data. Derivatives Show Caution Ahead Of Expiry Bitcoin was holding the $87,000–$89,000 range as $1.85 billion in options approached expiry. Reports show derivatives volume fell 39% while open interest remained flat, a mix that points to hesitation rather than aggressive positioning by traders. Technical measures show price compression near support, and traders are watching expiry closely because a larger move could follow when those contracts settle. Volatility has been lower than in some previous selloffs, and that has left price action tighter than many expected. Institutional Accumulation And The Missing Shock Moreno and others note the environment feels structurally different. Large institutional players and regulated ETFs have been buying more regularly, and those flows are not known to be selling in panic. That steady demand has helped prevent the kind of cascading failures seen in 2022, when Terra, Celsius and FTX collapsed and amplified losses across the market. Because those big shocks did not occur this time, the drawdown looks more controlled, even if prices are moving down. Outlook Hinges On Macro And Regulation Some analysts still predict 2026 could bring fresh highs, citing expected US rate cuts and a friendlier policy stance in Washington. At the same time, observers are watching whether Bitcoin’s tighter link to US stocks holds as macro and regulatory decisions land. If the correlation weakens, crypto may chart its own course. If it stays strong, the path for Bitcoin could be shaped largely by broader market moves rather than crypto-specific flows. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators What Traders Will Watch Based on reports and Moreno’s view, the key items to monitor are the one-year moving average, realized price levels near $56,000–$60,000, the outcome of options expiries, and whether institutional buyers continue steady purchases. Price action has been calmer than some past crises, but that calm has masked real downside risk. Analysts and traders are split; some expect a return to growth next year, while others are preparing for lower prices before any sustained recovery.

The latest events, however, are revolving around the readiness of the protocols. As Bitcoin closes the year 2025 with a -5% change as it continues consolidating, with Solana sustaining its momentum at a crucial point of resistance levels, Mutuum Finance has made considerable advances. The V1 lending & borrowing protocol used in the project has been audited by Halborn Security. This was followed by the implementation of all feedback received and the final code version being developed. With the team set to reveal the launch date of the protocol’s V1, Mutuum Finance, at $0.04 in the present presale phase, is considered to be a top pick in the list of cryptos to buy. Bitcoin Ends 2025 Flat BTC is closing 2025 unchanged. It continues moving in a way near to the price of about $88,410 with the support being at $88,210. The market is stable but it has been observed that the number of Bitcoin holders have been experiencing average realised losses of approximately $300 million per day. It is thus understandable why, despite its high profile among the cryptos, it appeared less enticing than its competitors that can grow faster in 2026. Solana Regains Momentum Solana is in the headlines after experiencing more than 140% increase in the trading volumes, as the prices kept soaring to the $127-$130 bracket. Open interest in the derivatives market of Solana is on the rise, which means a new wave of speculation. A rise above $130 could, therefore, result into a potential rise to $150. Although larger profits are made compared to Bitcoin, Solana is very market-dependent and that is why it is a less preferable alternative investment compared to a relatively new token like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Presale Strength of Mutuum In the present case, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised a total of 19,550,000 since its presale started and has drawn a total of 18,650 holders. Currently, the platform is at Phase 7 at a price of $0.04, which means that the price has grown by a desirable 300% compared to the Phase 1 price. Nevertheless, this stage will be sold at an early stage and will transfer to Phase 8 with a price of 0.045. Not like most other tokens, which were made exclusively for the intent of speculation, Mutuum Finance is now developing its lending and borrowing feature to encourage more demand. The fact that users can earn yield or borrow without selling their asset is set to boost activity on the platform. If all goes well, it appears that the long-term gains could be promising. An initial bet of $1,000 could result in gains of $15,000, assuming the token price reaches $0.60 during the early growth stage. Security and MUTM Readiness The degree of execution confidence is an essential long-term value factor. An independent audit has been conducted by Halborn Security in regard to Mutuum Finance, encompassing the examination of lending and borrowing contracts. This has also been completed, and the final analysis of the code has been concluded. Moreover, the readiness for the launch of MUTM V1 protocol has also been confirmed, boosting the overall readiness of Mutuum Finance regarding its appeal as top investment. Stacking Ahead Of 2026 Bitcoin and Solana are still key leaders within the market, though growth opportunities look relatively measured. Mutuum Finance, traded below $0.05, offers a combination of early-stage valuation, sound infrastructure, and legitimate DeFi use cases. When it comes to making a choice on which crypto is worth buying today for long-term strategic holding, MUTM is quickly emerging as a clear choice for the best crypto to buy today before the 2026 cycle.

According to official monitoring from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) , 48 jurisdictions committed to start collecting standardized crypto transaction and user data from January 1, 2026, with the first automatic cross-border exchanges expected to take place in 2027. Countries Begin Collecting Data Based on reports , service providers such as major exchanges, some broker platforms, crypto ATMs and certain custody services will be obliged to record account details, transaction histories and users’ tax residency information for reporting to domestic tax authorities. That information will be formatted so it can be shared automatically with partner tax offices once the exchange phase starts. The OECD monitoring update lays out the kinds of fields that must be gathered and stored for future reporting. What Exchanges Must Report According to news outlets tracking the rollout, exchanges are already adjusting onboarding forms and internal compliance systems to verify customers’ tax residency and capture wallet-level activity. Some jurisdictions, led by the United Kingdom, have moved faster to require platforms to keep detailed purchase and sale records for users in scope. Tax authorities will then receive yearly reports covering balances, transfers and gains for listed accounts. Operational Strain And Privacy Questions The new rules create practical burdens. Smaller platforms will need to upgrade systems or hire compliance staff to track the new data points. Based on reports, privacy advocates and parts of the crypto industry are warning that the depth of data collection could raise concerns about how long sensitive transaction records are held and who can access them. Some legal teams are already studying how domestic data-privacy laws interact with automatic information exchange. Middle Nations Join The Second Wave A further group of jurisdictions has said it will begin domestic collection later. Reports note that an additional 27 jurisdictions have timelines that target January 1, 2027 for starting to collect, with exchanges of information to follow in 2028 for that batch. At least one analysis of national updates also indicates that a handful of countries are planning to stagger implementation because of local legislative calendars. How This Will Play Out For Users For ordinary crypto users, the immediate change will be more questions during account setup and clearer record-keeping demands from providers. Based on official guidance, CARF itself does not create new taxes; rather, it gives tax offices the data they need to enforce existing rules. For some investors, that means past reporting gaps will be easier for authorities to spot. Reports have disclosed that implementation will vary by country. Some tax administrations are ready to receive standardized files in 2027, while others are still finishing domestic law changes. Observers say the rollout marks a major step toward treating crypto transactions like other financial accounts when it comes to cross-border tax transparency.

Bitcoin ended 2025 lower than where it began and is trading near $88,500. Meanwhile, data from Polymarket shows restrained upside expectations for BTC, with traders assigning just a 21% probability of Bitcoin reaching $150,000 before 2027. Bitcoin Bear Market Signals Grow Bitcoin may already be several weeks into a new bear market phase, according to on-chain and technical indicators tracked by CryptoQuant. During a recent episode of the Milk Road show, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno explained that the majority of metrics used in the firm’s bull score index turned bearish in early November and have not yet shown signs of recovery. The bull score index ranges from 0 to 100, and aggregates several indicators including network activity, investor profitability, Bitcoin demand, and market liquidity. According to Moreno, the final confirmation for him came when Bitcoin’s price fell below its one-year moving average,which is a long-term technical indicator widely used to assess broader market trends. He described this move as a clear signal that the market shifted into bearish territory, as the one-year moving average often acts as a dividing line between bull and bear cycles. Bitcoin began 2025 trading close to $93,000 before rallying to a peak of roughly $126,080 in October. However, it ended the year lower than where it started, according to data from CoinCodex . At press time, Bitcoin was trading near $88,500, proving that momentum has weakened despite optimism from analysts who expected 2026 to be a strong growth year for the asset. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinCodex ) Moreno believes that if the bear market thesis holds, Bitcoin could eventually bottom between $56,000 and $60,000 in the coming year. This estimate is based on Bitcoin’s realized price, which represents the average price at which current holders acquired their coins. Historically, Bitcoin prices have tended to fall back toward realized price levels during bear markets after deviating above them in bull cycles. A decline to that range would represent a drawdown of about 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high. Moreno explained that while this is a big drop, it would still be less severe than previous bear markets, which saw declines of 70% to 80%. In that sense, the current downturn could be viewed as comparatively mild. He also argued that this bear market seems structurally more stable than past cycles. Unlike 2022, when the collapse of major players like Terra, Celsius Network, and FTX triggered widespread panic, the current market has not experienced similar systemic failures. Moreno also pointed to steady accumulation by institutional investors and ETFs as factors that could help cushion downside pressure and support long-term market stability. Polymarket Traders Also Skeptical of Bitcoin Rally Meanwhile, prediction market traders on Polymarket are showing relatively cautious expectations for Bitcoin’s price trajectory, and assigned just a 21% probability that the cryptocurrency will reach $150,000 before the end of 2026. The odds prove that there is a sense of hesitation among traders, even as many analysts argue that Bitcoin’s next major bull phase may be delayed rather than canceled. Bitcoin’s price odds on Polymarket According to Polymarket’s active market asking what price Bitcoin will hit before 2027, the highest confidence bet currently sits at $100,000, which traders assign an 80% probability. Beyond that level, confidence drops sharply. Bitcoin reaching $120,000 is priced at a 45% chance, while the probability falls to 35% at $130,000, 28% at $140,000, and just 21% at $150,000. Even $120,000 would still sit below Bitcoin’s previous all-time high. Market participants seem to be factoring in structural changes to Bitcoin’s historical price behavior. The four-year cycle tied to halving events, which previously provided a rough framework for forecasting bull and bear markets, appears to be losing its predictive power after Bitcoin closed 2025 in negative territory. With that pattern breaking down, traders may be reassessing how much weight to give long-standing cycle-based models, opening the door for new dynamics to shape price action. Example of BTC’s 4-year cycle Despite subdued expectations in prediction markets, macro and regulatory developments also still fuel bullish narratives among analysts. Anticipation around President Donald Trump’s upcoming announcement of a new US Federal Reserve chair increased speculation that interest rate cuts could follow, which is a backdrop that already helped push gold and silver to record highs in late 2025. At the same time, proposed US crypto legislation, including the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, is expected to provide clearer regulatory guardrails that could encourage deeper institutional participation. Major financial institutions like Standard Chartered, Strategy, and Bernstein forecast Bitcoin reaching $150,000 in 2026, while more aggressive projections from Tom Lee of Fundstrat place long-term targets as high as $200,000 to $250,000.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-02T12:09:04.072054+00:00

Data from analytics firm SoSoValue reveals a net outflow of $4.57 billion over November and December 2025, coinciding with a sharp 20% decline in Bitcoin’s market value. This unprecedented movement signals a potential recalibration of institutional and retail investor sentiment toward flagship digital assets. Bitcoin ETF Outflow Reaches Historic Levels Analysts confirm the $4.57 billion exit from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs marks the largest two-month withdrawal since these funds launched in January 2024. Consequently, this substantial capital movement directly correlates with Bitcoin’s price dropping approximately one-fifth during the same period. Market observers note the outflows began accelerating in mid-November, following a period of relative stability earlier in the year. Furthermore, this trend represents a dramatic reversal from the consistent net inflows that characterized most of 2024 and early 2025. The following table illustrates the comparative fund flows for major cryptocurrency ETFs during the November-December 2025 period: ETF Type Net Flow (Nov-Dec 2025) Primary Trend Bitcoin Spot ETF -$4.57 Billion Record Outflow Ethereum Spot ETF -$2+ Billion Significant Outflow XRP ETF +$1+ Billion Notable Inflow Solana ETF +$500+ Million Moderate Inflow Several key factors potentially drive this capital rotation. First, macroeconomic pressures, including shifting interest rate expectations, often impact high-risk asset classes. Second, profit-taking after Bitcoin’s strong performance in Q3 2025 likely contributed. Third, increased regulatory scrutiny on large asset managers may have prompted portfolio rebalancing. Finally, the growing maturity of the crypto ETF market allows investors to diversify into newer fund offerings. Broader Cryptocurrency ETF Market Dynamics While Bitcoin and Ethereum funds experienced heavy selling pressure, other digital asset ETFs attracted substantial capital. Notably, spot XRP ETFs gathered over $1 billion in net inflows during the same two-month window. Similarly, Solana-focused ETFs pulled in more than $500 million. This divergence highlights a evolving market narrative where investors seek opportunities beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies. Market data suggests a strategic rotation into assets perceived to have stronger regulatory clarity or different technological value propositions. The contrasting flows reveal critical insights about current investor psychology. Investors appear to be reallocating capital based on specific catalysts rather than abandoning the digital asset class entirely. For instance, recent favorable legal developments for XRP likely boosted its ETF appeal. Conversely, Solana’s continued network resilience and developer growth may have attracted confidence. This selective movement underscores the increasing sophistication of ETF-based cryptocurrency investing, where fund choices reflect nuanced market theses. Expert Analysis on Market Implications Financial analysts emphasize the importance of context when interpreting these record outflows. “While the headline number is striking, it’s essential to view this within the lifecycle of these investment products,” states a report from CoinDesk, citing industry experts. The total assets under management (AUM) for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs still measure in the tens of billions, suggesting a deep and liquid market. Historically, ETF flows often exhibit cyclical patterns, with periods of outflow frequently preceding consolidation and subsequent inflows. The price correlation between ETF flows and Bitcoin’s spot market is a primary focus for researchers. The nearly 20% price drop alongside the outflows demonstrates the significant price impact these regulated products now wield. This relationship was less pronounced in the years before ETF approval, when market dynamics were driven more by decentralized exchanges and over-the-counter desks. The current environment shows a tighter coupling between traditional finance gateways and core crypto market volatility. Historical Context and Regulatory Landscape The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 followed a decade-long regulatory journey. Their approval represented a landmark moment for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Initially, these funds saw massive inflows, absorbing billions from both institutional and retail investors. The record outflow in late 2025, therefore, represents a critical stress test for the market infrastructure built over the preceding two years. Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) monitor these flows closely, as large, rapid movements can raise concerns about market stability and investor protection. Key developments in 2025 that set the stage for these flows include: Macroeconomic Policy Shifts: Changing central bank policies influenced risk appetite globally. Tax-Loss Harvesting: Year-end portfolio adjustments by U.S. investors likely amplified selling pressure. Product Proliferation: The introduction of ETFs for XRP, Solana, and other altcoins provided exit options for Bitcoin holdings. Technical Market Indicators: Bitcoin reaching certain resistance levels may have triggered automated selling strategies within fund structures. This period also tested the operational resilience of authorized participants and market makers who facilitate the creation and redemption of ETF shares. Their ability to manage over $4.5 billion in net redemptions without major operational hiccups is itself a sign of market maturation. The process involves converting ETF shares back into the underlying Bitcoin, which is then typically sold on the open market, applying downward price pressure. Conclusion The record $4.57 billion Bitcoin ETF outflow in late 2025 serves as a pivotal chapter in the integration of digital assets into regulated finance. While highlighting short-term bearish sentiment and a correlated price decline, the event also demonstrates the market’s capacity to handle significant capital movement. The simultaneous inflows into other cryptocurrency ETFs suggest a rotation, not a retreat, within the asset class. Moving forward, market participants will watch closely to see if this Bitcoin ETF outflow marks a temporary correction or the beginning of a longer-term trend, as the ecosystem continues to evolve under the watchful eye of investors and regulators alike. FAQs Q1: What caused the record Bitcoin ETF outflow in late 2025? The outflow likely resulted from a combination of factors: macroeconomic pressures prompting a shift away from risk assets, profit-taking by investors after prior gains, year-end tax considerations, and the availability of new alternative cryptocurrency ETFs for diversification. Q2: How did the Bitcoin ETF outflow affect BTC’s price? The net outflow of $4.57 billion coincided with a roughly 20% drop in Bitcoin’s price over the same two-month period. The selling pressure from ETF share redemptions, which requires selling the underlying Bitcoin, contributed significantly to this downward price movement. Q3: Did all cryptocurrency ETFs experience outflows during this period? No. While U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw significant outflows, spot XRP ETFs attracted over $1 billion in net inflows, and Solana ETFs pulled in more than $500 million, indicating a capital rotation within the crypto sector. Q4: Are record ETF outflows a sign of failing crypto ETFs? Not necessarily. Large outflows are a normal function of mature, liquid financial markets and represent changing investor allocations. The ability of the market infrastructure to process such a large movement without failure demonstrates operational resilience. Q5: Where does the money go when it leaves a Bitcoin ETF? When investors sell ETF shares, the fund’s authorized participants redeem those shares for the underlying Bitcoin. That Bitcoin is typically sold on the open market. The cash proceeds then return to the investor, who may hold it, reinvest in other assets like XRP or Solana ETFs, or move it into traditional investments.

Ripple’s XRP is also in the green daily, which is the first positive sign in a while. Before that, the asset lost its fourth place to BNB after dropping by more than 20% over the past month. Now, though, data shared by Ali Martinez indicate that there could be even more good news on the horizon for XRP, as the TD Sequential just flashed a buy signal on a more macro scale.

When it comes to XRP, it has had a successful streak in determining its next move, whether upward or not. Ripple’s cross-border token is now 1.7% up on the day, but it still sits below the crucial $1.90 level, which has turned support into resistance. CRYPTOWZRD also outlined the daily candle closing higher, but wasn’t convinced entirely about the asset’s future price performance. The analyst noted that the market needs to “see healthier movement from here and a better chart structure.” For now, XRP just remains within a small range-bound area without a clear breakout sign. It’s worth noting that despite the mid-year price surge to a new all-time high, Ripple’s native token ended 2025 in the red. This came despite the successful launch of several spot XRP ETFs in the US, and the highly impressive moves made by the company behind the token.

This expiry event is much smaller than average due to muted trading over the holiday period and the huge one last Friday. Trading has been subdued over the New Year holiday as expected, with volume and volatility low, and spot markets mostly sideways as we start a new month and a new year. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s small tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.48, meaning that there are a lot more calls (longs) expiring than puts (shorts). Max pain is around $88,000, according to Coinglass, which is pretty close to the current spot prices, so many will be in the money on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $100,000, which has $1.3 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There remains around $1.1 billion in OI at $75,000 and $80,000 as bearish bets mount up. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is at $28 billion, much lower now after last week’s massive expiry. “Overall, market liquidity remains subdued, and sentiment is pessimistic,” said crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live in a market update earlier this week. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 130,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $396 million, max pain at $2,950, and a put/call ratio of 0.62. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $6.7 billion, around a third of what it was in late August. Spot Market Outlook Nothing has really changed over the past month, observed analyst ‘Credibull Crypto’ on Friday. “As expected, we are simply chopping around at these levels with zero breaks in HTF [high time frame] market structure, despite many already claiming our cycle top is in.” The $74,000 support level remains unbroken, “and there are a number of indications that we are forming a bottom here,” they added. Analyst ‘Daan Crypto Trades’ observed the new monthly and yearly candle, stating, “You can assume that this candle will at least extend a bit further in both directions throughout the month. Generally, that first week especially does tend to give some fakeouts.” $BTC A new monthly & yearly candle has begun.

Bitcoin price rose to over $88,500, while Ethereum jumped by $3,000. The market capitalization of all tokens jumped by 1.35% to over $3 trillion. Most altcoins were in the green, with Story (IP) rising by 30%. Pepe token jumped by 25%, while Aerodrome Finance (AERO), Immutable (IMX), Filecoin (FIL), Maple Finance (SYRUP), and Render (RNDR) soared by over 10%. Crypto market rally today | Source: CMC Crypto market rally rose as investors bought the dip One potential reason why the crypto market rally is happening is that investors are buying the dip. Bitcoin remains 30% below its highest point in 2025, while Ethereum has plunged by 40%. Other top tokens have also dipped by double digits from last year’s high. It is common for investors to buy the dip after an asset crashes by double digits. The rebound is also happening as investors anticipate the so-called January Effect. The January Effect is a phenomenon where financial assets rise in January as investors start to buy after selling in December as part of tax-loss harvesting. Rising futures open interest The crypto rally is also happening as the futures open interest start rising. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the interest has jumped by 2.16% in the last 24 hours to $130 billion. Rising open interest is a sign that investors are deploying leverage, which is a bullish sign. Still, the interest remains much lower than last year’s high of over $255 billion. It has remained under pressure since the large liquidation event that happened on October 10, when over 1.6 million traders were wiped out. The rising futures open interest is happening as liquidations ease. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the 24-hour liquidation dropped by 40% to $141 million. 102,114 traders were liquidated in this period, with Bitcoin shorts worth $23.5 million being wiped out. Potential risk-on sentiment ahead of Fed cuts and IPOs The crypto market rally is also happening as investors embrace a risk-on sentiment as the year starts. Indeed, data shows that global stocks started the year well, with the Hang Seng Index rising by 2.70%, while the Sensex Index soared by 30 basis points. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices were also in the green. Market participants are bracing for a strong year, with most Wall Street analysts predicting that the S&P 500 Index will jump to $7,500 and above this year. The potential catalysts for the markets are Federal Reserve interest rate cuts , IPOs, including Anthropic, SpaceX, and Kunluxin , and strong earnings. Therefore, this optimism is helping to boost the crypto market. Potential dead cat bounce or bull trap Still, the main risk is that the ongoing rally of Bitcoin and altcoins could be a dead-cat bounce. Besides, the holiday mood is continuing, with the 24-hour volume plunging by 25% to $64 billion. In normal times, the volume in the crypto market is usually over $100 billion. A dead-cat bounce is a situation where assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies rebound briefly and then resume the downward trend as the momentum fades. The odds of a bull trap are elevated because past attempts to rebound have faced substantial resistance, with large companies like Wintermute and Binance selling. Also, Bitcoin and other altcoins have formed a bearish pennant pattern and remain below all moving averages, pointing to further declines.

Key Takeaways: Bithumb identified more than $200 million in dormant crypto spread across 2.6 million inactive accounts. One account held $2.84 million after nearly 12 years of inactivity, highlighting early crypto adopters who never returned. Some dormant assets posted gains exceeding 61,000%, showing how long-term inactivity amplified early-stage crypto returns. The disclosure came as part of a dormant asset recovery campaign aimed at users who have not logged in or traded for more than a year, according to Finance Feeds . Bithumb said inactive balances totaled about 291.6 billion Korean won, or roughly $201.8 million. Some of the accounts flagged in the review had shown no activity for more than a decade. Bithumb Finds $2.84M Dormant Account Idle for Nearly 12 Years According to the exchange, the single largest dormant balance was worth around $2.84 million. The longest period of inactivity stretched to 4,380 days, nearly 12 years, pointing to early market participants who entered during crypto’s formative years and never returned. The findings offer a glimpse into the industry’s early retail-driven phase, when users often bought small amounts of digital assets with little expectation of long-term value. Many of those accounts were abandoned as markets cooled, platforms evolved, or personal interest faded. In some cases, users may have assumed their holdings were insignificant, unaware that years of price appreciation had turned them into sizable sums. Bithumb said some dormant holdings recorded gains exceeding 61,000%, or roughly 610 times their original value. Tracing further reveals this wallet received ~93,947 BTC in 2017–2018, mainly from CEXs and CoinJoin, including HTX, Gemini, Bixin, Bitfinex, Bithumb, and QuadrigaCX. The wallet remained dormant for 3 years until 2020. With mixed sources like these and long dormancy, the funds… pic.twitter.com/XP5mMwjkV3 — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) October 11, 2025 These outsized returns reflect assets acquired in the earliest stages of crypto adoption, before broader public awareness and institutional involvement. For comparison, Bitcoin traded at around $767 at the start of 2014. At recent prices near $87,700, that represents a gain of about 11,300%, or roughly 114 times. Several of the forgotten assets held on Bithumb therefore outperformed Bitcoin over a similar timeframe, underscoring how early exposure combined with long-term inactivity can yield extreme results. The exchange has run similar recovery efforts before. During its 11th anniversary campaign last year, Bithumb said roughly 36,000 users reclaimed dormant assets worth about $50 million. The current campaign is larger in scale, reflecting both the platform’s age and the growth of the crypto market over time. Bithumb said it plans to notify eligible customers directly and assist with account recovery, positioning the initiative as part of its customer protection efforts. Beyond individual users, the disclosure carries broader implications for the market. Dormant balances represent latent supply that could re-enter circulation during future market cycles. Upbit Moves 99% of Customer Assets to Cold Storage After $30M Hack As reported, Upbit is shifting nearly all customer assets into cold storage after hackers stole 44.5 billion won (about $30 million) from its Solana hot wallet, marking one of the strongest security responses yet by a major exchange. Operator Dunamu said the platform will raise its cold wallet ratio to 99% and reduce hot wallet exposure to effectively zero, far above South Korea’s legal requirement that 80% of user funds be stored offline. The exchange already held 98.33% of assets in cold storage at the end of October, the highest among domestic platforms, but accelerated its overhaul following the breach. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have launched an investigation, and local reports have cited early intelligence assessments that allegedly connect the intrusion to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

Bitcoin’s renewed quantum debate reflects a divide between developers who see no near-term threat and critics who want visible preparedness, with proposals like BIP-360 aiming to preserve flexibility rather than rush adoption of still-inefficient quantum-resistant cryptography. Aave’s dispute between its DAO and Aave Labs highlights a fundamental problem in DeFi: the absence of clear legal frameworks defining how DAOs control revenue, brands, and offchain assets. U.S. Crypto Market Structure Bill Enters a Critical Phase 2026 will be a decisive year for U.S. Crypto regulation, as lawmakers weigh whether they can pass a comprehensive digital asset market structure bill before the mid-term elections. The market structure bill will be an all-encompassing framework that defines how digital assets are regulated, splits oversight between the SEC and CFTC, and clarifies which tokens fall outside securities law. Drafts from the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee are now on the table, with leadership signaling plans for early-2026 markups after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations with Democrats. Despite the momentum, several unresolved issues remain that could hinder the passage of the bill. These include how DeFi should be treated under AML and securities rules and whether the SEC or CFTC should have primary authority in classifying a token. Political sensitivities around President Trump's crypto conflict of interest also further complicate negotiations. What adds to the complexity is the U.S. mid-term election. The time window for reconciling Senate drafts and aligning with the House's already-passed CLARITY bill is narrow. Lawmakers only have the first half of the year to demonstrate tangible progress before the mid-term election dynamic takes over. Key Take The 2025 crypto cycle was driven less by speculative retail momentum and more by regulatory signaling, clearer rules, a pro-crypto presidency, and a more constructive stance from the SEC and CFTC, but unlike hype-fueled liquidity surges, regulatory progress delivers its benefits slowly, requiring time to translate optimism into real adoption and sustained market growth. The passage of the GENIUS Act demonstrates the tangible impact of regulatory clarity: stablecoin market capitalization expanded from roughly $200 billion to over $300 billion, while clear rules unlocked participation from major technology and financial institutions, triggering a new wave of institutional stablecoin issuance. Despite encouraging public signals, passage of a comprehensive crypto market structure bill is far from assured; industry insiders in Washington put the odds at only 50–60%, warning that the legislation’s complexity and exposure to politically sensitive issues could still derail it. Quantum Computing Reignites a Long-Running Bitcoin Debate Debates around how Bitcoin should prepare for quantum computing's threat have reignited, centering on a clear divide between bitcoin developers and critics over how early should the network start to prepare for the potential risks. On one side, Bitcoin developers argue that quantum computing does not pose a practical threat in the near term. They point out that quantum computing capable of breaking Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography do not exist today and are unlikely to for decades. On the other side, critics argue the problem is not about the precise timelines but more about preparedness. They argue even if the threat is currently theoretical, the absence of a visible plan creates uncertainty, particularly as governments and large tech firms are already preparing for quantum-resistant cryptography. The key question is not when quantum computers arrive, but whether Bitcoin has a credible path to adapt. Currently, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360 (BIP-360) outlines a gradual upgrade path toward quantum-resistant address formats. The proposal introduces new signature schemes designed to withstand quantum attacks, allowing users to opt in by moving funds to new addresses over time rather than a network-wide change. Key Take One of the biggest challenges with current post-quantum cryptography is efficiency. Many quantum-resistant schemes require significantly larger key and signature sizes, increasing transaction weight, bandwidth usage, and storage costs. Post-quantum cryptography is rapidly improving in efficiency, with signature sizes shrinking dramatically over time — from roughly 8,000 bytes in early schemes like Lamport signatures in 2011 to around 350 bytes for modern designs such as SPHINCS by late 2025. However, even with this progress, quantum-resistant signatures remain several times larger than Bitcoin’s current 64-byte ECDSA standard. Rushing Bitcoin into quantum-resistant cryptography could lock the network into suboptimal designs, while the actual threat remains distant. What matters most is preserving flexibility, a clear, credible upgrade path that allows Bitcoin to adopt mature solutions when the technology is truly ready. Aave Governance Showdown: DAO vs. Aave Labs A major governance dispute has erupted between Aave DAO and Aave Labs. Aave DAO is the decentralized autonomous organization responsible for governing the Aave protocol, the largest DeFi lending protocol with over $33B in total value locked. It operates through community voting by AAVE token holders. Aave Labs is the centralized development entity and core team behind the Aave ecosystem. It functions as a company focused on building and maintaining products. The Aave DAO and Aave Labs are now publicly at odds over who ultimately controls key revenue streams, the user-facing interface, and even the Aave brand. The conflict was triggered by Aave Lab's decision to integrate CoW Swap into the Aave interface, diverting swap fees away from the DAO treasury and toward Aave Labs. Aave Labs argues this revenue comes from a privately owned front-end product, while DAO delegates view this move as a de facto privatization of protocol-related income that could amount to over $10 million annually. Key Take At its core, the issue can be attributed to a single root cause: there is no clear legal structure or enforceable definition governing the relationship between the DAO and the corporate entities operating around it. There is no formal legal framework specifying: How a DAO can legally own, control, or monetize revenue; How a DAO can hold, license, or enforce rights over brands, trademarks, and intellectual property; What fiduciary or economic obligations builders and service providers owe to tokenholders. Many DAOs, including Aave, have operated under this ambiguity. While it may have enabled rapid growth in earlier stages when incentives were aligned, conflicts can easily erupt once meaningful and visible value emerges without clear legal arrangements defining who is entitled to claim it. This event is not a failure of decentralized governance. Onchain governance functions well for smart contracts, but it cannot address offchain assets such as brands or intellectual property, which require real-world legal enforceability. Just as the GENIUS Act provides stablecoins with clear legal status, decentralized finance protocols will also need clear regulatory and legal pathways to integrate sustainably with the real world. Weekly Market Chart: Bitcoin’s Volatility Declines According to data from Bitwise, Bitcoin’s volatility has been on a downward trend since 2020. Throughout 2025, Bitcoin has been less volatile than the market’s most popular stock, Nvidia. This shift reflects a fundamental change in Bitcoin’s characteristics: it is increasingly de-risking as an investment and benefiting from a more diversified investor base, driven by traditional investment vehicles such as Bitcoin treasury companies and ETFs.

According to March 2025 data from the world’s three largest cryptocurrency futures platforms by open interest, aggregate positioning shows traders maintaining nearly equal long and short exposure. This precise 49.29% long versus 50.71% short distribution represents one of the most neutral sentiment readings in recent months, potentially indicating consolidation before significant price movement. Market analysts closely monitor these BTC perpetual futures metrics because they provide real-time insight into trader psychology and potential market direction. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Analysis The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as a critical sentiment indicator for cryptocurrency markets. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures lack expiration dates and utilize funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. Consequently, the distribution of long versus short positions reveals collective market expectations. Currently, the aggregate 49.29% long to 50.71% short ratio demonstrates minimal directional bias among leveraged traders. This equilibrium suggests neither overwhelming bullish nor bearish conviction dominates current market psychology. Furthermore, the consistency across major exchanges indicates broad-based sentiment rather than platform-specific phenomena. Exchange-specific data reveals subtle variations in trader positioning. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, shows 49.3% long positions against 50.7% short positions. Similarly, OKX displays 49.64% long versus 50.36% short positioning. Interestingly, Bybit demonstrates a slight bullish tilt with 51.02% long positions against 48.98% short exposure. These minor discrepancies highlight how different trading communities exhibit varying risk appetites and market interpretations. However, the overall convergence toward neutrality remains the dominant narrative across all three platforms. Market structure analysts emphasize that such balanced ratios often precede periods of increased volatility when consensus breaks. Cryptocurrency Derivatives Market Context The cryptocurrency derivatives market has evolved significantly since Bitcoin futures first launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. Today, perpetual futures dominate trading volumes, offering continuous exposure without contract rollovers. The combined open interest across Binance, OKX, and Bybit regularly exceeds $15 billion, making their collective positioning data particularly influential. When analyzing BTC perpetual futures ratios, market participants consider several contextual factors. These include overall market capitalization, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s halving cycle. The current neutral positioning emerges against a backdrop of institutional adoption milestones and evolving regulatory frameworks worldwide. Historical analysis reveals patterns in long/short ratio behavior. During strong bull markets, long ratios frequently exceed 60%, while bear markets often see short ratios surpassing 55%. The current near-50/50 distribution mirrors patterns observed during previous consolidation phases. For instance, similar ratios preceded the 2023 rally following the banking crisis and the 2024 breakout after spot ETF approvals. Market technicians also correlate these ratios with funding rates, which remain moderately positive across exchanges. This combination suggests cautious optimism rather than speculative frenzy. Additionally, the stability of these ratios over the 24-hour measurement period indicates sustained rather than fleeting sentiment. Expert Interpretation of Market Positioning Derivatives analysts emphasize the importance of exchange-specific nuances when interpreting BTC perpetual futures data. Bybit’s slight long bias may reflect its retail-heavy user base, while Binance’s perfect balance could indicate sophisticated institutional participation. OKX’s positioning often correlates with Asian market hours and regional sentiment. According to cryptocurrency market researchers, balanced ratios frequently signal indecision among traders awaiting catalysts. Potential triggers include macroeconomic data releases, regulatory announcements, or Bitcoin network developments. The current equilibrium suggests traders position cautiously ahead of known events, including quarterly expiries and scheduled protocol upgrades. Risk management professionals highlight the implications for market stability. Balanced long/short ratios typically reduce systemic leverage risks because opposing positions create natural hedges within the ecosystem. However, they also increase vulnerability to sudden sentiment shifts when consensus emerges. Trading volume patterns accompanying these ratios provide additional context. Recent data shows stable volumes without the spikes characteristic of capitulation or euphoria phases. This volume profile supports the neutral sentiment interpretation. Market makers and liquidity providers reportedly adjust spreads and depth based on these ratio readings, affecting execution quality for all participants. Comparative Analysis Across Trading Platforms A detailed comparison of exchange-specific BTC perpetual futures ratios reveals meaningful patterns. The following table summarizes the 24-hour positioning data across the three major platforms: Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 49.3% 50.7% -1.4% (Slightly Bearish) OKX 49.64% 50.36% -0.72% (Neutral) Bybit 51.02% 48.98% +2.04% (Slightly Bullish) Aggregate 49.29% 50.71% -1.42% (Neutral) Several factors contribute to these inter-exchange variations: User demographics: Different platforms attract distinct trader profiles Geographic concentration: Regional market hours influence positioning Product features: Leverage limits and interface designs affect behavior Liquidity conditions: Execution quality varies across platforms Notably, the aggregate ratio weights exchanges by their open interest, giving Binance’s positioning disproportionate influence. This methodology accurately reflects market-wide exposure. The consistency across platforms suggests genuine consensus rather than statistical anomaly. Historical data indicates that such convergence often precedes trend establishment. Market participants monitor whether Bybit’s bullish tilt spreads to other platforms or whether Binance’s neutrality becomes dominant. These dynamics will likely determine the next sustained price movement. Market Impact and Future Implications The current BTC perpetual futures positioning carries several implications for market structure. First, balanced ratios typically correlate with range-bound price action as opposing forces cancel out. Second, they indicate healthy skepticism rather than irrational exuberance or fear. Third, they suggest available capital for directional moves when catalysts emerge. Trading strategists note that such environments favor certain approaches: Volatility strategies: Options traders may position for impending breakouts Range trading: Spot traders might capitalize on defined support and resistance Basis trading: Arbitrageurs could exploit futures-spot discrepancies Gamma hedging: Market makers may adjust options inventories Market health indicators beyond long/short ratios provide complementary context. Funding rates remain slightly positive, suggesting longs pay shorts but without excessive pressure. Open interest shows stability rather than dramatic expansion or contraction. Liquidations data reveals minimal forced position closures. Together, these metrics paint a picture of cautious equilibrium. Regulatory developments increasingly influence derivatives markets, with jurisdictions implementing position limits and reporting requirements. These changes may affect future ratio patterns as compliance adjusts trading behavior. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio analysis reveals a market in careful balance during March 2025. With aggregate positioning at 49.29% long versus 50.71% short, traders exhibit remarkable neutrality across major cryptocurrency exchanges. This equilibrium suggests collective indecision ahead of potential catalysts, with subtle variations between platforms reflecting different user demographics and regional influences. Market participants should monitor whether this balance persists or breaks with forthcoming developments. The BTC perpetual futures market continues providing invaluable sentiment signals, with current ratios indicating neither excessive greed nor fear dominates cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Such balanced conditions historically precede significant price movements when consensus eventually forms. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio measure? The ratio measures the percentage of open long positions versus short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specified exchanges. It indicates whether traders collectively lean bullish (more longs) or bearish (more shorts). Q2: Why is the current ratio significant? The near 50/50 split across major exchanges suggests balanced market sentiment without strong directional bias. Historically, such equilibrium often precedes periods of increased volatility when consensus breaks. Q3: How do exchanges differ in their ratios? Bybit shows slight bullish bias (51.02% long), Binance demonstrates near-perfect balance, and OKX falls between them. These variations reflect different user bases, geographic concentrations, and platform features. Q4: What factors could change these ratios? Major price movements, regulatory announcements, macroeconomic developments, or Bitcoin network events typically shift trader positioning. Unexpected news often triggers rapid ratio adjustments. Q5: How should traders use this information? Professional traders incorporate ratio data into broader market analysis alongside price action, volume, funding rates, and macroeconomic context. It serves as one sentiment indicator among many rather than a standalone signal.

Early risk-taking showed up most clearly in Asia, where Hong Kong and South Korea led gains as technology and semiconductor shares extended a late 2025 bounce. Japan and mainland China stayed shut for holidays, which kept liquidity light across the region. Crypto traders kept a close eye on whether Bitcoin can turn that calm into momentum, after a choppy stretch around the year-end. Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said Bitcoin is gradually regaining strength. “For the first time in months, the 30-day change in long-term holder supply has turned positive, rising by around 10,700 BTC, signalling renewed conviction among investors,” he said. “At the same time, continued exchange outflows suggest reduced selling pressure, helping build momentum. If Bitcoin manages to clear the $89,500 resistance, a decisive move towards the $100,000 mark is likely, with $87,000 emerging as a strong support level.” Market snapshot Bitcoin : $88,574, up 1.2% Ether : $3,009, up 1.2% XRP : $1.87, up 2% Total crypto market cap: $3.08 trillion, up 1.2% Equity Futures Advance On Year-End Strength In Technology Shares Across equity futures, investors leaned into the same year-opening tone, S&P 500 futures rose 0.29% and Nasdaq futures added 0.36% as traders carried over a year-end lift in big tech. That optimism still traces back to the AI trade, which powered much of 2025’s gains as money chased applications, data centres and advanced chips. As 2026 begins, investors are watching whether earnings can keep validating those valuations, especially with policy uncertainty building in Washington. Attention now shifts to the US economy and the Federal Reserve, with markets waiting on delayed data after the US government shutdown and recalibrating expectations for rate cuts. Traders price in only a 15% chance of a cut this month, with one more reduction seen by June. Markets Brace For Political Risk And Policy Shifts Politics also sits squarely in the mix, President Donald Trump is expected to announce Chair Jerome Powell’s replacement later this month, a move that investors see as another potential source of volatility. Meanwhile, metals stayed in the spotlight after a blockbuster 2025, spot gold rose 0.9% to $4,351.70 an ounce and spot silver jumped 2% to $72.63 per ounce, extending a run powered by rate-cut expectations, geopolitical tension and demand flows. In currencies, the dollar started the year on the back foot after its steepest annual drop in eight years, with investors weighing a more dovish Fed path against a shifting global rate backdrop.

Key Takeaways: CryptoQuant says Bitcoin may have entered a bear market in early November. Bitcoin’s drop below its one-year moving average is the key signal confirming a broader trend shift. Moreno expects a potential bear market bottom between $56,000 and $60,000. Speaking on the Milk Road show on Thursday, Moreno said the majority of signals behind CryptoQuant’s bull score index have been flashing warning signs for weeks. The index, which ranges from 0 to 100, tracks a mix of metrics including network activity, investor profitability, Bitcoin demand, and overall market liquidity. Bitcoin Falling Below One-Year Moving Average Signals Trend Shift For Moreno, the most decisive signal is a familiar long-term technical marker: Bitcoin falling below its one-year moving average. That indicator, which reflects the average price over the past 12 months, is often used to distinguish between broader uptrends and downtrends. “For me, the last confirmation is the price going below its one-year moving average,” Moreno said, adding that this move typically marks a transition into bearish conditions. Bitcoin’s recent price action appears to support that view. After starting 2025 near $93,000, the asset rallied to a peak of around $126,080 in October before reversing course and ending the year below its opening level, according to data from CoinGecko. As of Friday, Bitcoin was trading near $88,500. If the current phase is indeed a bear market, it challenges widely held expectations that 2026 would mark another strong growth year for Bitcoin. Instead, Moreno argues the market may still be in the process of finding a bottom. Based on Bitcoin’s realized price, the average price at which current holders acquired their coins, Moreno estimates a potential bear market low in the $56,000 to $60,000 range over the next year. Historically, he said, Bitcoin prices tend to drift back toward this realized level during prolonged downturns, after deviating sharply higher in bull markets. Bitcoin’s Potential 55% Drawdown Seen as Mild by Historical Standards A decline to that range would represent a drawdown of roughly 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high. While significant, Moreno views that figure as relatively mild by historical standards. Previous bear markets have seen losses of 70% to 80% from peak levels, often accompanied by cascading failures across the crypto industry. This cycle, however, looks structurally different. Moreno noted the absence of major systemic collapses so far, unlike 2022, when the implosions of Terra, Celsius, and FTX triggered widespread panic and forced selling. He also pointed to the growing role of institutional participants , including ETFs and long-term allocators , who tend to buy steadily and are less likely to exit positions during downturns. That shift, combined with a deeper pool of market participants and more established infrastructure, could help cushion the downside even if bearish conditions persist. “In previous bear markets, the demand was basically, you know contracting,” Moreno said. “I would say that structurally, we now have more like institutional or ETFs that don’t sell, and also there’s some buying there.” The post Bitcoin May Already Be Two Months Into a Bear Market: CryptoQuant appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Market,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2026-01-02T12:09:04.072054+00:00

Speaking on an episode of the Milk Road show on Thursday, CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno said that most of the indicators he tracks through the firm’s bull score index turned bearish in early November and have not yet recovered. The index, which ranges from 0 to 100, aggregates multiple metrics, including network activity, investor profitability, Bitcoin demand, and market liquidity, to assess overall market conditions. Key metrics signal a bearish shift Moreno said the final confirmation, in his view, came from a technical signal: Bitcoin’s price falling below its one-year moving average. This indicator, which reflects the average price of an asset over the past 12 months, is commonly used to identify long-term trends. “For me the last confirmation, it’s a technical indicator, which is the price going below its one-year moving average,” Moreno said, adding that this move typically confirms a transition into a bear market. Bitcoin began 2025 trading at around $93,000 and climbed to a peak of $126,080 in October, according to data from CoinGecko. However, it ended the year below its starting level, challenging expectations that the post-halving period would sustain higher prices. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading near $88,716. If Bitcoin is indeed in a bear market, Moreno’s assessment runs counter to predictions from analysts who have pointed to 2026 as a potential growth year for the asset. Potential bottom in the $56,000–$60,000 range Looking ahead, Moreno suggested that Bitcoin’s bear market bottom could fall between $56,000 and $60,000 over the coming year. His estimate is based on Bitcoin’s realized price, which represents the average price at which current holders acquired their coins, and on patterns observed in previous bear markets. “Historically, what happened in previous bear markets, you see the price coming down to what is called the realized price,” Moreno said. During bull markets, prices tend to trade well above this level, but in bear markets, the realized price often acts as a baseline for potential lows. A decline to the $56,000 level would represent a drawdown of roughly 55% from Bitcoin’s all-time high. While significant, Moreno noted that this would be less severe than in past cycles, when Bitcoin has experienced drawdowns of 70% to 80%. A more resilient bear market environment Moreno also argued that the current downturn appears more stable compared to previous bear markets. Unlike 2022, which was marked by major industry collapses such as the Terra ecosystem, Celsius Network, and FTX, the current period has not seen similarly high-profile failures. He pointed to structural changes in the market, including the presence of large institutional participants and exchange-traded funds that tend to buy on a more regular basis and are less likely to sell during downturns. According to Moreno, this steady demand helps cushion price declines. “There are other types of players now that buy more periodically,” he said, adding that demand in past bear markets typically contracted more sharply. With a broader base of investors and more established companies in the sector, Moreno suggested that Bitcoin’s current bear market, if confirmed, may prove less volatile than those of the past.

This rally marks a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, reflecting renewed institutional confidence and shifting macroeconomic winds. Consequently, analysts are closely examining the drivers behind this ascent. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through Key Psychological Barrier The Bitcoin price crossing $89,000 represents a crucial technical and psychological achievement. Market data from Bitcoin World and other aggregators confirms sustained buying pressure. Historically, such round-number milestones often act as both targets and resistance levels. Therefore, this breakthrough suggests underlying strength in the current market cycle. Several immediate factors contributed to this price action. First, recent regulatory clarity in major economies has reduced uncertainty. Second, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows have shown consistent growth. Finally, broader macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns, are driving asset diversification. For instance, on-chain data reveals substantial accumulation by long-term holders. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Rally Drivers This cryptocurrency rally extends beyond simple speculation. A confluence of fundamental and technical drivers provides context. The adoption of blockchain technology by traditional finance accelerates. Moreover, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues to hit record highs, signaling robust security and miner commitment. The following table outlines key metrics surrounding this price event: Metric Detail Price $89,008.28 Primary Market Binance USDT Pair 24-Hour Volume Significantly Above Average Key Resistance Broken $88,500 – $89,000 Zone Market sentiment, as measured by established fear and greed indices, has shifted from neutral to greedy. However, this does not necessarily indicate an immediate top. Past cycles show sustained rallies can continue despite elevated sentiment readings. The current market structure differs markedly from the 2021 peak, featuring more mature infrastructure. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of institutional participation. Reports from firms like Fidelity and BlackRock highlight growing corporate treasury allocations. This institutional inflow creates a more stable price floor compared to previous retail-driven rallies. Experts point to the volatility compression observed in recent months as a precursor to this breakout. Furthermore, the macroeconomic landscape provides a tailwind. Central bank policies in 2024 and early 2025 have influenced capital flows. As a result, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a digital hedge, similar to gold. This narrative gains strength with each inflationary data release. The asset’s fixed supply stands in stark contrast to expansive monetary policies. Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to $89,000 follows a predictable yet volatile path. The asset has weathered multiple 50%+ drawdowns since its inception. Each recovery has reached new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-term trend. The current price sits within a critical range that could determine the next macro phase. Network Fundamentals: Active addresses and settlement volume remain strong. Miner Health: Revenue is sufficient to support operations post-halving. Regulatory Environment: Clearer frameworks reduce systemic risk. Technological Development: Layer-2 solutions improve utility and scalability. Comparisons to traditional assets are inevitable. Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance often outpaces major indices. This relative strength attracts capital from other asset classes. However, correlations with equities can shift rapidly during risk-off events. Investors must monitor these dynamics closely.
