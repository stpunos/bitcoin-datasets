By 2029, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $477.67. In 2032, AAVE will range between $658.59 to $776.19. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2026? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $166.90 Market cap $2.498B Trading volume (24-h) $185.89M Circulating supply 15.18M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $161.00 24-hour high $166.01 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.86% (Very High) 50-day SMA $177.34 14-Day RSI 48.52 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $225.24 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways : AAVE has stabilized above $160 after a sharp selloff, signaling short-term strength. Momentum indicators favor continuation, but $170–175 is a critical resistance zone. Failure to hold $158–160 would quickly revive downside pressure. Aave 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for January 5, AAVE is trading around $166.5 after rebounding from the late-December selloff that pushed price briefly below $150. The recovery is technically meaningful as price has reclaimed the Bollinger mid-band near $160, with expanding green candles suggesting buyers are defending higher lows. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView However, AAVE remains capped well below the upper Bollinger band around $183, which aligns with prior breakdown structure, keeping the broader trend neutral rather than bullish. The MACD has flipped positive with rising histogram bars, signaling improving momentum; however, the move still appears corrective within a larger consolidation unless $170–175 is decisively cleared on strong volume. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE shows a cleaner bullish structure, printing higher highs and higher lows since reclaiming $155. Price is holding above the Alligator moving averages, which are now fanning upward, confirming short-term trend alignment. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI is elevated near 66, indicating strong momentum but also hinting that upside could slow near $168–170, a zone that previously rejected price. As long as $160–158 holds as support, pullbacks remain technically healthy, while a loss of this area would weaken the short-term bullish bias and risk a rotation back toward $150. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $213.50 SELL SMA 5 $186.27 SELL SMA 10 $176.93 SELL SMA 21 $170.49 SELL SMA 50 $177.34 SELL SMA 100 $206.02 SELL SMA 200 $225.24 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $167.60 SELL EMA 5 $178.38 SELL EMA 10 $204.65 SELL EMA 21 $240.76 SELL EMA 50 $268.45 SELL EMA 100 $269.22 SELL EMA 200 $254.01 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is likely to attempt a grind toward $170–175 in the near term, but only a strong daily close above that zone would shift the broader outlook bullish. Otherwise, traders can expect consolidation with heightened sensitivity to any loss of the $160 support. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve. If DeFi continues to grow and mature, Aave isn’t just likely to stick around; it’ll probably be one of the key players shaping the future.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI (14) is at 54, while MACD is improving but remains below zero, showing recovery without a strong trend. Support is at $0.212 and $0.210, while resistance is at $0.214 and $0.217 As of January 6, 2026, Pi Network is trading around $0.2127, showing moderate intraday weakness after failing to hold recent highs. The token is still holding above the $0.21 area, which continues to act as short-term support, while overall price action remains calm rather than impulsive. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis On the daily session, Pi traded within a narrow range, with an open near $0.2132, a high around $0.2144, a low at $0.2115, and a close near $0.2127. The tight candle structure reflects consolidation, indicating that buyers are stepping in on dips near support, but upside momentum remains limited as sellers defend higher levels. The RSI (14) is at 53.62, sitting above the neutral 50 level, which suggests moderate bullish control. The RSI is still below overbought territory, indicating that buying pressure is steady but not aggressive. This supports the idea of stabilization rather than a breakout. PI/USD Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) continues to improve, with the histogram slightly positive at +0.0020, while the MACD line remains below zero at -0.0014 and the signal line at -0.0034. This setup signals that Pi is recovering from a weaker phase, with downside momentum fading, but the broader trend has not yet flipped fully bullish. Support is holding near $0.211, with a stronger base around $0.210, where buyers have repeatedly defended the price. On the upside, resistance remains strong near $0.214, followed by $0.217, which has capped recent attempts higher. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, Pi is trading around $0.2130, moving sideways after the recent push higher from the $0.20 area. Price action shows tight consolidation just below $0.214, with small candles clustering in a narrow range, which suggests buyers are still defending dips but momentum has paused rather than expanded into a breakout. The RSI (14) is near 59.7, staying above the neutral 50 level, which confirms mild bullish control, though it has eased from earlier highs, signaling slowing upside momentum. PI/USD Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the histogram remains positive at around +0.0017, and the MACD line is slightly above the signal line, indicating bullish pressure is still present, but weak and gradual rather than aggressive. On the 4hour timeframe, support is holding around $0.210 and $0.211, where buyers have repeatedly stepped in, while resistance sits near $0.214, which continues to cap short-term advances. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2707 SELL SMA 5 $0.2354 SELL SMA 10 $0.2207 SELL SMA 21 $0.2157 SELL SMA 50 $0.2278 SELL SMA 100 $0.2377 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2112 SELL EMA 5 $0.2185 SELL EMA 10 $0.2396 SELL EMA 21 $0.2782 SELL EMA 50 $0.3429 SELL EMA 100 $0.4387 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to remain range-bound in the near term, with price oscillating between the $0.21 support and the $0.215 resistance as momentum indicators cool after the recent push higher. A clear break above $0.215 could open room for a short-term continuation, while a slip below $0.21 would point to renewed consolidation rather than an immediate reversal. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. Why is PI’s price up today? PI is up today mainly due to improving technical momentum, with the price reclaiming short-term moving averages and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD turning positive. Optimism around the Protocol v23 upgrade, which introduced Rust-based smart contracts and improved network performance, has also supported sentiment. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value. Recent Pi News/Opinions Pi Network’s Core Team published a 2025 recap highlighting milestones such as February’s Open Network launch, AI integrations, and ongoing KYC progress.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates.

As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In 2028, it will range between $9.14 and $10.97, with an average price of $9.46. In 2030, it will range between $18.49 and $22.35, with an average price of $19.03. In 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $4.54 Market cap $95.36M 24-hour trading volume $20.94M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $1.41 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $4.77 24-hour low $1.41 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 6.22% 50-day SMA $4.28 200-day SMA $7.26 Sentiment Bearish Green days 17/30 (57%) Fear and Greed Index 42 (Fear) ORDI price analysis On January 8, ORDI’s price fell by 3.10% in 24 hours following a sell-off that had lasted months. Its trading volume fell 10.58%, showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView ORDI has been in a bearish trend since September 2025. It now trades along the Williams Alligator trendlines, signaling a potentially uneventful market after the price dropped below support levels (78.60% Fibonacci level) and key moving averages. The coin had positive momentum this week, slowing its drop. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are above zero, signaling a bull market. At the same time, the relative strength index (RSI) is in neutral territory. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart indicates that ORDI is moving downwards at the $4.50 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.0039). The William Alligator trendlines indicate that its volatility is rising. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 6.20 SELL SMA 5 5.57 SELL SMA 10 5.13 SELL SMA 21 4.56 BUY SMA 50 4.28 BUY SMA 100 4.99 SELL SMA 200 7.26 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 4.31 BUY EMA 5 4.43 BUY EMA 10 5.13 SELL EMA 21 6.40 SELL EMA 50 7.76 SELL EMA 100 8.58 SELL EMA 200 11.22 SELL What to expect from the ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a fear sentiment among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which has risen above $90,000, following a brief recovery. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it vulnerable during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity amplifies price movements. ORDI’s turnover ratio (volume/market cap) is 0.216, well below major assets. This thin liquidity amplifies price swings on modest order flow. Recent news BitVMX has launched the first cross-chain bridge connecting Bitcoin Ordinals to Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. Concurrent upgrades to Unisat Wallet’s UTXO management improved user experience for BRC-20 token interactions. Will ORDI reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will reach $50 before 2032. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will reach $100 before 2032. Will ORDI reach $1,000? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will reach $1,000 before 2032. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $18.49 and $22.35, with an average price of $19.03. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $100 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or stringent regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction indicates how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed, falling below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it dropped $8 and assumed a bearish run; by December, it had reached $3.80. In 2026, it rose above $4.50.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades at 50, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Selling domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are aiming for a trend continuation above $100K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.22, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $95,339, it will fuel a bullish rally to $104,759. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $84,588, beginning a bearish trend to $83,492. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling pressure as buyers failed to push the price above immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028.

Echoing the views of several other prominent voices in finance – notably of Robert Kiyosaki – McGlone opined on January 1 that 2026 will be a year of volatility and crisis but also one of opportunity for the ‘tactically orientated’ to make a fortune. Base Case Update 2026 – Dope-Sniffing Dogs May Prevail: – Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000 – President Trump faces similarly poor timing as Herbert Hoover – A third down year for US stocks since 2008 – Cryptos to lead the next… — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) January 1, 2026 Will the Great Depression 2.0 start in 2026? Though measured in tone, the Commodity Strategist hinted he expects 2026 to be a crisis year by providing a historical parallel. Specifically, he opined that President Donald Trump shall suffer from poor timing, much like President Herbert Hoover. Hoover famously entered the Oval Office in 1929, mere months before the Great Depression started. McGlone provided both evidence for his assumptions and issued several stark predictions. Specifically, he identified gold’s grabbing of alpha – its ability to outperform the market – as a major warning sign evident through much of 2025. Gold grabbing alpha in 2025 was a warning – especially vs. falling crude oil Unfortunately for investors hoping to benefit from the precious metals boom, the market expert also opined that gold, silver , and most similar assets will suffer from, in his words, ‘went up-too-much’ dangers in 2026. Similarly, McGlone identified T-Bonds – the debt securities of the American government – as the stars of the market, as he estimates they will be the ones to ‘take alpha’ from the yellow metal in the ongoing year. Will the crypto market bloom in 2026? Mike McGlone simultaneously gave a word of warning to cryptocurrency investors as he forecasted that a Bitcoin ( BTC ) fall to $50,000 is more likely than a rally back to $100,000. As evidence, he cited that Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the digital assets market – dropped 19% last year. Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000. Cryptos to lead the next post-inflation deflation cycle due to wealth creation reversion. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index dropped 19% in 2025. External evidence that the cryptocurrency bull market can be found in the fact that the 4-year BTC cycle pattern has been broken. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to enjoy three green years followed by a major correction. BTC 12-month price chart.

However, while the pressure is clearly visible, artificial intelligence ( AI ) models suggest that the cryptocurrency may somewhat stabilize this month and maybe see some gains. Some early signs of this stabilization may already be evident, with Bitcoin trading at around $89,500 at the time of writing, up nearly 2% on the day due to a supportive technical picture. Bitcoin price reclaims key technical levels A few of the core momentum measures have also strengthened, led by the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 70.4, signaling firm upside momentum.

For instance, the Average Directional Index ( ADX ) rose to 65.2, a level typically associated with bullish directional moves. Similarly, a positive Rate of Change ( ROC ) at 1.308 indicates that bulls are firmly in control of order flow. However, it must be noted that the white/red Stochastic Oscillator, which measures price momentum over the past nine periods smoothed across six periods, is at 99.2, suggesting a consolidation period or a pullback toward short-term moving averages is possible. AI Bitcoin price prediction for January 2026 With the technical picture hinting at potential short-term upticks, Finbold used its AI-driven price prediction tool to see where BTC could sit by the end of the month. To generate its forecast, the model aggregates results from ChatGPT , Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4, pointing to a range of potential outcomes. Finbold AI BTC price forecast. Source: Finbold The average Bitcoin price target for the end of January came out at $91,900, implying a 2.67% upside from current levels. Claude Sonnet 4 gave the most bullish figure, projecting a potential 6.97% rally, while Gemini 2.5 Flash actually suggested the price could go down 0.07% downside. ChatGPT was bullish but conservative, arguing for a 1.1% gain. Finbold AI BTC technical analysis. Source: Finbold Overall, Bitcoin’s potential this month primarily reflects its technical resilience, although it can be added that $12 million in altcoin-driven liquidity inflows could also have played a role. In other words, short-term momentum currently favors buyers, who are closely watching whether Bitcoin can defend support around $88,319, the 61.8% Fibonacci level .

According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, a bearish market sentiment has taken hold over the past few months, with some market watchers claiming the top of the four-year market cycle has already passed. The crypto market analytics platform believes investor sentiment has changed due to Bitcoin’s muted end-of-year performance, but the lines between traditional financial assets and crypto are also blurred, as companies experiment with new forms of tokenization. Delphi market analysis: Equity is moving onchain Per Delphi’s 2026 outlook , the distinction between tokens and traditional equity is now more difficult to define since companies like California-based Securitize are filing for initial public offerings (IPOs) while simultaneously looking into tokenization. Crypto is facing a token identity crisis. The lines are blurring on both sides. Equity is moving onchain with companies like Securitize filing for IPOs. Tokens are becoming more equity like through MetaDAO's ownership coins and Uniswap's fee switch. Customer Acquisition Cost… pic.twitter.com/CgjHQuHq8q — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) January 1, 2026 Some crypto projects, such as MetaDAO have launched ownership tokens that mimic how traditional financial firms issue shares, and decentralized platform Uniswap has added fee switches, much like how equity-like returns are for token holders. Among the upcoming token models is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tokens, which are distinct to equity-like tokens or governance mechanisms because they fund user acquisition at scale. PayPal is one of the many companies moving forward with tokenization, having spent over $60 million in venture capital cash on incentives to begin its quest for digital assets. Yet, per Delphi, CAC tokens could achieve comparable results through token emissions, where early adopters can receive larger rewards that taper as the network grows. The analysts cited Worldcoin as the best example of this model, reportedly spreading over 500 million WLD tokens to onboard users and expanding the footprint of its World App. According to data from Dune analytics, the project crossed $3.8 billion market cap level during the bull market run in mid-2025, although its token’s price traded below $2.5 in the whole of last year. US regulatory clarity opens crypto market to institutions Changes in regulations have made things much clearer for the crypto industry, especially in the US and Europe. POTUS signed an executive order in the US to encourage responsible innovation and the use of stablecoins backed by the dollar. However, he also clearly said that a CBDC was not an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went a step ahead to support experimentation by issuing no-action letters for the Depository Trust Company’s tokenization pilot and the Fuse Crypto Token. US Congress is in support of crypto-friendly candidates for 2026 midterms. This comes against the backdrop of discussing the CLARITY Act , which places crypto regulatory oversight in the hands of the CFTC. Although some economists believe there are still some hiccups in country-by-country jurisdictional rules, MiCA has been protecting investors and has made the environment more palatable for institutions to join in. Crypto market mulls optimism as Bitcoin trades just below $90,000 Despite the ongoing gloomy outlook, there is a perception that the industry has grown enough to handle downturns and escape historic crypto winters. “It’s more of an industry now. So if there is a winter or a downturn, it’s not going to be a complete lights-out moment,” Kaiko senior researcher Adam Morgan McCarthy told NPR. The crypto derivatives market has approximately $2.2 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options reaching expiration, with the former taking up $1.87 billion in notional value currently outstanding. At the time of this reporting, the king coin is trading at around $88,970, just above the $88,000 “max pain” point, where option writers may start counting heavy losses. Coinglass open interest data shows 14,194 call contracts have been placed against 6,806 puts, which could mean hodlers are bracing for a price comeback upwards of $90,000.

Price action is compressing, RSI is turning higher, and institutional buyers continue to accumulate, yet prediction markets remain skeptical of a rapid six-figure breakout. Polymarket odds still favor $120,000 as the most likely outcome, even as Bitcoin trades within a tightening triangle near $89,000. The next move could set the tone for the year ahead. Polymarket: Why Traders Are Hesitant to Predict a Quick $150K Bitcoin Price Surge Bitcoin is kickstarting 2026 with a mixed bag of optimism and realism. While analysts are still tossing around six-figure targets, Polymarket traders are still being cautious about how high they think BTC can go before 2027. Looking at the market odds, you see that the most likely outcome is $120,000, with a 45% probability, even though that level is below its 2025 all-time high. But the confidence in higher targets is starting to wane. Polymarket is saying: 35% of traders think $130,000 is a possibility 28% of traders think $140,000 is a possibility 21% of traders think $150,000 is a possibility Source: Polymarket By contrast, the market is saying there’s probably an 80% chance Bitcoin either holds or recovers the $100,000 zone, suggesting traders think it will hold firm but don’t expect a rags-to-riches surge right away. This caution might be due to cycle dynamics – Bitcoin ended last year in the red, and with the 4-year halving cycle coming to a close, traders are probably being a bit more picky about where they put their bets. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Signals Long-Term Commitment On the other hand, despite softer sentiment among individual traders, the institutions are still putting their money where their mouth is. In the last quarter of 2025, Japan-based Metaplanet added 4,279 BTC, bringing its stash to 35,102 BTC, which is worth a cool $3.1 billion at today’s prices. Even though their stock price has been a bit of a dud, they’re still treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Tether has done the same thing. As BTC dipped below $88,000, the stablecoin issuer added 8,889 BTC, which cost them about $778.7 million. These purchases don’t guarantee a quick price spike, but they do show that the big players are using the dips to get a bit more exposure. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Triangle Breakout Or Triangle Breakdown? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction continues to be neutral, as BTC is trading around $89,400, stuck inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. This pattern is more about tightening volatility than any weakness. The price is still forming higher lows, and the resistance line is sloping down from $92,800 to $93,000. BTC is oscillating around a pivot zone near $88,200-$89,000, where the 50-day and 100-day EMA100-day EMAs are converging. This compression of the EMAs is a sign of balance, not a sign that things are approaching a breaking point. As long as the price stays above the rising trendline from $84,400 and the 200-day EMA near $87,000, the overall structure remains constructive. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The candlestick action is backing that up as well. Recent sessions are showing spinning tops and small-bodied candles, which are more a sign of indecision than of selling off. The RSI has broken its short-term downtrend and is now above 55, suggesting momentum is strengthening. If Bitcoin can close above $90,500, that would resolve the triangle to the upside and open a path towards $92,800 and then $95,000. If it breaks below $87,000, though, that would be a blow to the setup and open the possibility of a move down to $85,800; at the moment, the structure is more likely to be on the upside. What Could Trigger Bitcoin’s Next Major Move in 2026 With institutions soaking up supply and price compressing to a technical apex, the setup suggests preparation is underway, not exhaustion. Whether the next move is a measured breakout or just another range expansion will define how quickly those $150,000 targets start looking realistic. For now, traders are betting on patience, and history suggests Bitcoin tends to reward it. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

While there has been no significant bullish breakout yet, the price is pressing against key local resistances. Buyers are trying to reclaim control, but the lack of follow-through makes this a pivotal area to watch. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC remains trapped within a descending channel, testing the upper boundary once again near the critical $90K level. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages located above $95K act as major dynamic resistance levels, and buyers have yet to reclaim them. Despite recent bounce attempts, momentum has been fading. RSI is climbing but is still around the neutral territory, indicating that there is room for a move higher. If buyers fail to break above the $90K zone and the higher boundary of the channel, another visit to the $80K support zone remains likely. Until that breakout happens, this is still a bearish market structure. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the asset has been consolidating in a short-term channel. Multiple rejections from the $90K level, located at the middle of the channel, have formed a mid-range ceiling. Meanwhile, higher lows forming gradually below this zone show that buyers are slowly stepping in. The RSI is also pushing higher, showing bullish momentum building while still not being overbought. If a clean breakout above $90K occurs with strength, it opens up the way for a move toward the primary resistance zone at $95K. On the other hand, failure at the $90K zone could mean another sweep back toward $86K and even a breakdown of the channel that could pave the way for a deeper drop toward the $80K area. On-Chain Analysis The BTC exchange reserve metric continues to drop sharply, hitting 2.75M BTC, a significant multi-year low. This trend reflects ongoing accumulation and reduced sell pressure on centralized exchanges. While the price action has remained stagnant, this underlying metric supports the long-term bullish thesis. However, the disconnect between low reserves and weak price action highlights the broader uncertainty and hesitation among market participants heading into the first quarter of 2026. Therefore, more sideways or even corrections might be required before the market can begin rallying again.

As per the current market, “What price will Bitcoin hit before 2027?” Polymarket shows 45% odds of Bitcoin reaching $120,000. Notably, this price point is below its all-time high. The probabilities drop sharply at higher price levels, with $130,000 carrying a 35% chance, $140,000 falling to 28%, and $150,000 priced at just 21%. Reports indicate that traders are placing a safe bet, with an 80% likelihood that BTC will reach a peak of $100,000 . With this move in place, sources claimed that it was unclear why users opt to be very cautious. Some assumed that they decided to adopt this approach in relation to the end of the four-year cycle , following Bitcoin’s major losses in 2025. Uncertainties surrounding the fate of Bitcoin spark controversy Regarding the four-year cycle, it is worth noting that the cycle followed trends around halving events in the history of BTC. It also played a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by helping traders forecast future movements. Now that the cycle is losing prominence, analysts suggest that a new trading pattern may be emerging. Interestingly, despite the crypto market being pessimistic, experts still propose that 2026 will be a strong year for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump made it clear that he intends to announce the US Federal Reserve’s new chair in the upcoming weeks. This news sparked hope in the cryptocurrency industry, as many had anticipated that interest rates would decrease. Immediately after those assumptions, the prices of precious metals, such as gold and silver, increased significantly, with both reaching new peaks in the last quarter of 2025. Digital assets, on the other hand, remained unchanged. Analysts are now expressing the likelihood of crucial crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, to provide straightforward regulations and potentially facilitate significant institutional adoption. Several analysts from firms such as Standard Chartered, Strategy, and Bernstein forecast that the price of BTC may reach an all-time high of $150,000 by 2026. Others, like Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who adopted a more positive outlook on the matter, suggested that the cryptocurrency could rise as much as $200,000 to $250,000. Traders point out some of the limitations surrounding BTC’s growth Bitcoin’s price ignited tension in the crypto industry after dropping sharply in November. Analysts claim that some factors could not sustain the cryptocurrency’s price above the $110,000 level. These factors were institutional investments and corporate purchases. They provided various reasons to back this claim. Among these reasons, one key factor raised is the surging interest in Bitcoin options, particularly those related to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. In the meantime, it was confirmed that the total open interest in Bitcoin options escalated from a record of $39 billion noted in December 2024 to a new level in December 2025. Analysts explained that this rise led to heightened awareness of the covered call strategy in the ecosystem. Critics, on the other hand, expressed their belief that by leasing out their anticipated earnings for a fee, major investors have unintentionally set a restriction that halts Bitcoin from attaining its next substantial growth phase. To better understand this point, analysts noted that it is useful to perceive a covered call as an option between earning a higher price and receiving a regular income. Don’t just read crypto news.

This development follows the year-end holiday period when traditional markets closed while cryptocurrency spot trading continued globally. Market analysts now scrutinize this price discrepancy as a potential catalyst for increased volatility during early 2026 trading sessions. Understanding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap represents a measurable price difference between the December 31, 2025 closing price and the January 2, 2026 opening price. Importantly, this gap formed because Bitcoin’s spot market continued trading during the CME’s holiday closure from December 31 through January 1. Consequently, when futures trading resumed, the contract prices adjusted to reflect spot market movements that occurred during the exchange’s inactivity. Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized market analyst, first identified this development through social media platform X. The analyst noted that such gaps typically become focal points for short-term trading strategies. Furthermore, historical data shows that approximately 85% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies significantly based on market conditions. The Mechanics of Futures Market Dislocations CME Bitcoin futures operate on a regulated schedule that differs from cryptocurrency spot markets. While spot exchanges like Coinbase and Binance operate 24/7 throughout the year, traditional derivatives markets observe specific holidays and weekends. This structural difference creates periodic disconnections between derivative and spot prices. Recent Notable CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps Date Gap Size Fill Time Market Context January 2024 $420 3 days Post-ETF approval rally July 2024 $580 14 days Regulatory uncertainty period January 2025 $510 7 days Institutional adoption phase January 2026 $655 TBD Current analysis period Market Implications and Historical Precedents The current $655 gap represents one of the larger January openings in CME Bitcoin futures history. Market participants generally monitor these gaps because they often create technical trading opportunities. Specifically, traders might position themselves to profit from the expected price movement toward the gap fill level. However, the timing remains uncertain and depends on multiple market factors. Historical analysis reveals several important patterns: January gaps tend to fill faster than mid-year gaps, averaging 5.3 days versus 11.7 days Larger gaps (over $500) typically indicate stronger market momentum during the closure period Institutional participation in gap fills has increased steadily since 2023 Volatility spikes often accompany the gap-filling process, particularly during Asian trading hours Expert Perspectives on the 2026 Market Opening Financial analysts emphasize that CME gaps provide valuable information about market sentiment during exchange closures. The $655 discrepancy suggests significant spot market activity occurred while institutional traders couldn’t adjust their futures positions. This situation potentially indicates several market dynamics, including retail-driven movements, geopolitical developments, or algorithmic trading patterns that continued during the holiday period. According to derivatives market specialists, CME Bitcoin futures now represent approximately 35% of all regulated Bitcoin derivatives volume globally. This substantial market share means gaps in CME contracts often influence broader market psychology, even affecting spot prices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The current gap’s size suggests particularly strong momentum developed during the two-day trading hiatus. Technical Analysis and Trading Considerations Traders typically approach CME gaps using specific technical methodologies. The gap area itself often functions as both support and resistance, depending on the gap’s direction. For the current $655 gap, analysts will monitor whether prices move toward filling the gap quickly or if the market establishes new trading ranges above or below the gap zone. Several factors could influence how this situation develops: Volume analysis during the first week of January trading Institutional flows through regulated investment products Global macroeconomic developments affecting risk assets Cryptocurrency-specific news regarding regulation or adoption Market technicians note that gap fills don’t always occur immediately. Sometimes markets establish new trends that leave gaps unfilled for extended periods. However, statistical analysis shows that CME Bitcoin futures gaps under $700 have a 92% fill rate within 30 trading days, based on data from 2020 through 2025. The Regulatory and Institutional Context The CME’s position as a regulated exchange adds significance to these market events. Unlike cryptocurrency-native derivatives platforms, CME operates under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight with traditional market hours and holiday schedules. This regulatory framework attracts institutional participants who may interpret gaps differently than cryptocurrency-native traders. Since the 2023 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the relationship between CME futures and spot markets has strengthened considerably. Many institutional trading desks now use CME futures for hedging ETF exposures, creating additional connections between these market segments. The January 2026 gap therefore reflects not just holiday trading patterns but also evolving institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Global Market Reactions and Comparative Analysis While the CME observed its holiday schedule, other global derivatives markets showed varied responses. European exchanges with different holiday calendars displayed smaller gaps, while Asian markets demonstrated continuous trading throughout the period. This geographic variation in market structure creates arbitrage opportunities that sophisticated traders often exploit during such dislocations. The $655 gap size exceeds most comparable periods in recent years. For context, the average January CME Bitcoin futures gap from 2021-2025 measured $387, making the current development approximately 69% larger than the recent average. This substantial difference suggests unusual market conditions developed during the year-end transition period. Risk Management Perspectives Professional traders emphasize that gap trading carries specific risks. While historical patterns provide guidance, each market situation involves unique variables. Risk managers typically recommend position sizing that accounts for the possibility that gaps may not fill as expected or may take longer than anticipated to resolve. Additionally, the increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and traditional markets adds complexity to gap analysis. During the 2025 holiday period, traditional equity and bond markets also experienced unusual movements that might have influenced cryptocurrency sentiment indirectly through portfolio rebalancing or risk appetite adjustments. Conclusion The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap forming on the first trading day of 2026 represents a significant market development with implications for short-term volatility and trading strategies. This event highlights the ongoing structural differences between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency trading ecosystems. As institutional participation in cryptocurrency derivatives grows, understanding these market mechanics becomes increasingly important for all market participants. The coming weeks will reveal whether this gap fills quickly or establishes new trading parameters for early 2026. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a CME Bitcoin futures gap? A CME Bitcoin futures gap occurs when there’s a price difference between the closing price before a market holiday and the opening price after the holiday. This happens because Bitcoin’s spot market trades continuously while CME futures have specific trading hours and holidays. Q2: How often do these gaps typically get filled? Historical data from 2020-2025 shows approximately 85-92% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies from immediate to several weeks depending on market conditions and gap size. Q3: Why does the CME have different trading hours than spot cryptocurrency exchanges? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange operates as a traditional regulated financial exchange with set hours and holidays, while cryptocurrency spot markets operate 24/7 globally without traditional market closures. Q4: How does this $655 gap compare to previous years? The $655 gap exceeds the average January gap of $387 from 2021-2025 by approximately 69%, making it one of the larger January openings in recent CME Bitcoin futures history. Q5: What should traders watch regarding this development? Traders typically monitor trading volume, institutional flows, and whether prices begin moving toward the gap level. The speed and manner of any potential gap fill can provide insights into market sentiment and momentum for early 2026.

Index fund flows and passive investing have fundamentally altered market dynamics, making stock-picking more challenging and indexation effects unavoidable. Portfolio allocation size matters more than simple buy/hold/sell labels; conviction and volatility should drive position sizing. Sector movements are increasingly dictated by ETF flows, causing good companies to underperform as index dominance overshadows fundamentals. “Mediocre.” I guess there are many worse things we can be called. I've been called plenty of those in the comments section here, as I approach 2,500 of those answered in 3 years. Quite a journey so far. Thanks to all who have taken the time to read my work during 2025. Mediocre is also how I describe how Bitcoin has performed historically. Does that sound strange, given its monster move earlier this year to an all-time high? Or, due to its even bigger run-up since before most of us knew what cryptocurrency was (or when “staking” was a misspelled way to say, “I'm making steak for dinner”)? Here's what I'm getting at. This is Bitcoin's price since mid-November of 2021. So more than 4 years ago. That's when it touched $60,000. Since that time, it has doubled, and then some, topping out at $126,000 on October 6 of 2025. And now, around $88,000 near year-end 2025, off 30% from that peak, it is up only 34% from where it was more than 49 months ago. So about an 8% annualized return. Data by YCharts The bad news: that's a lot more risk to take on when, as we see below, T-bills earned half that return, despite starting near a 0% rate in late 2021. And the much-maligned non-US segment of the stock market, represented above by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF ( EFA ), had a nice year in 2025, but that followed 3 years of zilch. Yet based only on the strength of a solid past 12 months, EFA's return since that November 2021 starting point now exceeds that of Bitcoin. As we see above, EFA (orange line) and Bitcoin (purple line) took very different directions but ended up at about the same spot. What does this say about Bitcoin's future as an investment? NOTHING. What does it say about perception versus reality when it comes to popular asset types? A LOT. This is why I recently published this table as part of a detailed article on how I'm using 10 ETFs as the current “core” of my Allocation portfolio that I run for investing group members and also share with subscribers at my website. The goal is to coach investors based on my experience allocating through modern market conditions, with risk management at the forefront of everything. ETF Yourself Using Bitcoin to lower risk? You might be surprised to hear “Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT )” and “risk management at the forefront” in the same place. That's the whole idea. To combine asset classes that often exhibit LOW CORRELATION to each other, particularly when markets tank. Look, I get it. Crypto-millionaires and even billionaires are out there. I live close enough to Miami, where many of them now reside, to realize that. But with all investments, there are the early adopters. And while some hit it big, time after time, for many it is more like a strategic “lottery ticket.” The way venture capitalists reportedly fail 90% of the time . But if that one out of 10 takes off, the other 9 are quickly forgotten. Among my other pursuits, I own a partial interest in some racehorses. It's the steadiest part of the game (“claiming”), but it is still a sport in which one win pays for a string of 5th- and 6th-place finishes. The focus here is on the iShares Bitcoin ETF, the largest of its kind. And its relationship to the S&P 500, past and potentially in the future. Because recently, the biggest, most exciting trades of the last few years have started to roll over. But as I recall as a past dog owner, they can flip themselves right back up in a nanosecond. So that's always a possibility. When markets are driven as they are now by algorithms and index fund flows, and nearly every market segment picks a side (are you a risk-on asset or a risk-off asset?), this is something we'll all need to live with as investors. Market indecision is much more common these days. And it leads me to the key factor of position-sizing. Position-sizing: a quick introduction My entire investing process is about this: “Buy/Hold/Sell” are very misleading ways to characterize any investment at any point in time. It says everything about WHAT you are owning or not, but not a thing about HOW MUCH AS A PERCENT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO you are allocating to it. If I have a buy rating on 2 stocks, 1 might be 1% of my portfolio (more volatile, less committed to it, just dipping my toe in for starters). And the other is 5% of my portfolio. That might be because it is much less volatile, and I need to own more to get the dollar return I seek. Or, I might just believe it is an ideal situation (chart-wise, which is my main approach). Now to that IBIT situation and why I have it as a semi-regular spot among 10 ETFs in that allocation portfolio. I've smoothed this out to 3-month rolling returns, with 1-month moving windows. And while IBIT is just reaching 2 years old, the thing with Bitcoin is this: it acts differently with so much ETF money having plowed in. The same can be said for the S&P 500. Data by YCharts Yet in that picture above, I see a pair of ETFs that sometimes rise and fall together but are different in terms of volatility and the potential to move independently of each other. I can't say that about a lot of equity ETFs compared to SPY and about a lot of crypto ETFs compared to IBIT. So for now, they exhibit enough for me to allocate to each, just in varying allocations. Based on their relative attractiveness. These are the basics of diversification. But it is SO MUCH TOUGHER to find nowadays. Thanks to the forces that now move markets. And the jury is still out on Bitcoin's true place in the long-term fabric of the investor's total picture. If you were there more than 10 years ago, congratulations, you are up 15,000%. If you jumped on board 4 years ago, you underperformed much of the stock market. Data by YCharts And if you were one of many who piled in at the start of 2024, when IBIT and 11 other spot Bitcoin ETFs made it easier to own crypto, you are up 87%, comfortably ahead of SPY over that same time. Now, with reference to this chart below, just 3 months ago IBIT led SPY by 168% to 44%. So that margin went from 124% to under 40% in a hurry. Data by YCharts But that again is my point. Stock picking or allocating across many types of stocks via ETFs is not nearly as productive or efficient as it once was. And the IBIT/SPY pair is part of a mountain of evidence supporting that, which grows every day. But since IBIT is still being treated as the nascent asset it is, this is still a good time to consider it. So it made it into my 10-ETF mix, something I frankly was not expecting. That is, until I whittled 4,400 ETFs down to my forced target of only 10. Now, I allocate tactically AMONG the 10 in that table above. I own at least a little of each at all times, as long as it is in the 10. A “permanent portfolio,” if you will. But where are the individual ETFs that make up the 10? While most will stay on the roster for a long time, some will be swapped out. Not when they look unattractive from a short-term return standpoint. When they are no longer providing a diversification benefit, either long-term or short-term. For now, IBIT makes the cut. I can control risk in it with that 2% minimum weighting and control my own excitement toward it (if that happens) with that 10% maximum weighting. And I remind myself that 5% is a “long-term expected average” position for IBIT within the 10 ETF portfolio, though 2% to 10% is the range I'm allowing myself to trade it within. To me, THAT is investing today. Not simply what I own, but how much and how often. Do I like SPY or IBIT better? I like both to different degrees at different times. And in the 10-ETF portfolio, I left SPY out entirely in its cap-weighted form, opting instead to use a mix of QQQ-DIA-RSP, as that trio is much more flexible than SPY alone (separate article on that coming soon). IBIT's technical chart does not look robust, and it is still subject to a combination of big risks. Just ask Michael Saylor (head man at Strategy, symbol MSTR). Those risks include a potential top in crypto enthusiasm, due in part to a peak in market liquidity, as well as repatriation of assets toward home currency assets (China and Japan are doing a lot of that currently). Barchart I've documented SPY's risks here many times for many years. And in its top-heavy form, it still hangs in there, for now. IBIT, SPY, and the bigger portfolio-wide impacts So, why do I make room for at least a 2% allocation to IBIT and also to each of QQQ, DIA, and RSP in that 10-ETF model portfolio? Because: I don't think I'm smarter than the market. I want diversification, but smart diversification, not “I think I'm diversified” diversification, which fails when we need it most. I have a mechanism to produce indicators as to how I want to rotate between those 4 ETFs and the 6 others pictured in the table. My method (ROAR) is not the subject of this article, but it will be in others. And it's there not to be pushed on people, but to show how SOMETHING should be your allocation mechanism. Not just “every 3 months I rebalance.” IBIT allows me to take some shots with small amounts of money, by design. In its brief history, it has had an 80% rally in 3 months and lost more than 25% in 3 months. It's 30% off its high as I write this. 3 months' time! So I expect there to be tactical opportunities to spot in the charts and rotate between that 2% and 10% allocation range. Data by YCharts Finally, using SPY as a proxy for the trio of stock ETFs I use in the 10-ETF portfolio, but the only “offensive weapon” I use in my 2-ETF portfolio (alongside BIL, a T-bill ETF), here's the range of possible outcomes based on the past. Since just before the pandemic, it has shown the potential to move more than 20% in either direction over a 3-month period. Data by YCharts That's a good reason to not set it and forget it, even if US equities are the default anchor of the portfolio. But those defense ETFs are the backstop, something I think more investors should consider the case for in their portfolios. This is all about risk management WHILE pursuing return over all time frames. My goal is to keep drawdowns below 5% and sacrifice some upside at times if that's what it takes. But am I limiting my ability to compete with a traditional “balanced” portfolio over time? Not at all, as I'll continue to discuss here in the new year. Because risk management does not mean capping returns. It means keeping enough capital intact at all times to live to fight another day, or year for that matter.",IBIT|BTC-USD|VOO|IVV|SPY|DIA|DJI|IWM|NDX|QQQ|SP500,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This move, announced via GlobeNewswire, signals a broader industry trend where cryptocurrency miners are diversifying their business models beyond pure digital asset production. Consequently, the transaction represents a calculated reallocation of resources in response to evolving market dynamics and technological opportunities. Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Major Portfolio Restructuring Bitfarms Ltd. has sold its 70-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility in Paso Pe, Paraguay, to Sympatheia Power Fund. The company disclosed the $30 million deal on May 15, 2025. This sale concludes Bitfarms’ operational presence in Latin America. The facility previously contributed to the company’s global hash rate. However, management has decided to reallocate these assets. Therefore, the proceeds will fund new ventures in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). The Paso Pe site began operations in 2022. It leveraged Paraguay’s abundant hydroelectric power. This renewable energy source offered a cost-effective advantage for energy-intensive mining. Nonetheless, the company’s strategic review identified greater potential elsewhere. Subsequently, executives approved the divestment. This decision aligns with a corporate focus on higher-margin infrastructure projects. Moreover, it optimizes the company’s geographical footprint for future growth. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Mining Industry’s Strategic Pivot The Bitcoin mining sector is undergoing a substantial transformation. Historically, companies competed primarily on hash rate and energy cost. Now, many are exploring adjacent technological fields. For instance, HPC and AI data centers require similar infrastructure. They need robust power supplies, advanced cooling, and secure facilities. Consequently, mining firms possess transferable expertise. This industry shift is driven by several key factors. Post-Halving Economics: The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards. This event pressured mining profitability, compelling operational efficiency. Energy Market Volatility: Global energy price fluctuations impact mining margins significantly, encouraging diversification. AI Infrastructure Demand: Demand for AI compute power is surging, creating a lucrative adjacent market for data center operators. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations in various jurisdictions introduce uncertainty, prompting portfolio adjustments. Capital Allocation: Investors increasingly reward diversified technology plays over single-asset commodity producers. This trend is not isolated to Bitfarms. Several other publicly-traded miners have announced similar strategic reviews. They are evaluating existing assets for alternative uses. Therefore, the Bitfarms Paraguay sale is a notable case study in this broader movement. Expert Perspective on Mining Industry Evolution Industry analysts view this move as a logical adaptation. “Mining companies are natural infrastructure operators,” notes a report from Compass Point Research. “Their core competency is managing large-scale, power-hungry computing operations in often remote locations. This skill set translates directly to the burgeoning HPC and AI data center market.” The report further highlights that the capital-intensive nature of mining necessitates constant evaluation of return on invested capital (ROIC). Financial data supports this strategic rationale. A comparison of key metrics illustrates the potential appeal of diversifying revenue streams. Potential Revenue Stream Comparison: Bitcoin Mining vs. AI/HPC Hosting Metric Traditional Bitcoin Mining AI/HPC Infrastructure Hosting Revenue Model Volatile; tied to Bitcoin price & network difficulty Predictable; often long-term contracted service fees Capital Intensity Very High (ASIC hardware) High (GPU/TPU clusters & cooling) Power Cost Sensitivity Extremely High High, but often passed through in contracts Hardware Lifespan ~3-4 years before obsolescence ~4-5 years, with more upgrade flexibility Regulatory Scrutiny Increasing globally Established and generally stable This comparative analysis shows why diversification is attractive. AI infrastructure offers more stable, contracted revenue. It also faces different regulatory pressures. Therefore, Bitfarms’ pivot aims to build a more resilient business model. The Future Focus: High-Performance Computing and AI Energy Infrastructure Bitfarms plans to reinvest the $30 million from the Paraguay sale. The capital will develop high-performance computing and AI-based energy infrastructure. Company executives have outlined a clear vision. They intend to leverage their existing expertise in large-scale electrical and thermal management. This expertise is critical for modern data centers. Specifically, AI training clusters generate immense heat. Efficient cooling solutions are paramount. Mining firms have years of experience solving this problem. The company’s existing facilities in the United States and Canada are potential candidates for conversion. These sites already have secured power contracts and robust grid connections. Furthermore, they are located in regions with supportive policies for technology investment. Redeveloping a portion of these sites for HPC could happen relatively quickly. This approach allows for a phased transition. It also mitigates risk by maintaining some Bitcoin mining revenue during the build-out. This strategic direction receives support from market forecasts. Demand for AI compute is projected to grow exponentially through the decade. Firms providing the physical infrastructure for this demand are well-positioned. Consequently, Bitfarms is entering a competitive but high-growth market. Their differentiator will be proven experience in managing megawatt-scale computing operations reliably and efficiently. Conclusion The sale of the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility represents a strategic inflection point for the company and reflects a wider evolution within the cryptocurrency mining industry. By exiting Latin America and reallocating $30 million toward high-performance computing and AI infrastructure, Bitfarms is proactively adapting to post-halving economics and capitalizing on the explosive demand for artificial intelligence compute capacity. This pivot highlights the increasing convergence between digital asset infrastructure and the broader technology sector, as firms leverage their core operational competencies to secure future growth in adjacent, high-value markets. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitfarms sell its Paraguay facility? Bitfarms sold the facility as part of a strategic shift to reallocate capital from pure Bitcoin mining toward developing infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence, aiming for more diversified and potentially stable revenue streams. Q2: Who purchased the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility? The 70 MW facility in Paso Pe was purchased by Sympatheia Power Fund for a total of $30 million, as reported by GlobeNewswire. Q3: Does this sale mean Bitfarms is exiting Bitcoin mining entirely? No, the sale marks an exit from Latin America, but Bitfarms continues its Bitcoin mining operations in other regions, such as the United States and Canada. The move is a portfolio optimization, not a full exit from the industry. Q4: What is high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure? HPC and AI infrastructure refers to the specialized data centers that house powerful computing clusters (like GPUs and TPUs) used for complex tasks such as scientific research, data analysis, and training artificial intelligence models. These facilities require massive amounts of power and advanced cooling, similar to Bitcoin mining farms. Q5: How might this strategic shift affect Bitfarms’ future financial performance? The shift could lead to a more diversified revenue model with longer-term contracts from HPC/AI hosting, potentially reducing volatility compared to earnings solely dependent on Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty. However, success depends on execution and competition in the new market.

YBTC’s holdings are primarily US Treasury bills, with complex options positions rather than traditional covered calls on Bitcoin ETFs. We go over the return profile to illustrate why most covered call funds don't pass our tests. Today, we will focus on Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). According to their website, this is what it does. The Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF is the first U.S. listed bitcoin covered call ETF. 1 The Fund offers exposure to exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) that have direct exposure to bitcoin * , subject to a cap, while providing the potential for current income. YBTC is an actively-managed ETF. Source: Roundhill The fund does not directly ""invest"" (we have to use the quotes here) in Bitcoin but uses exchange-traded products. When we read that, we thought it might just hold a Bitcoin ETF and then sell calls on that. You probably thought the same. Instead, when we examine the holdings, they present a drastically different picture. YBTC Their current AUM is around $224 million, so the entire AUM is invested in US Treasury bills. A tiny portion is also invested in Government Treasury mutual fund ($143,176), and some is held as cash ($798,464). The actual bitcoin-related holdings are strange, to say the least. Here's the first one. YBTC This appears to be a purchased call option. Normally with covered call funds, you would expect to see the underlying ETF, which in this case is iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), and then a call sold. So this would then appear with a negative sign. A purchased call is the opposite of what you would expect these funds to do. This is also right at the money ($49.72 strike) and close to expiration (Jan 16, 2026). Seeking Alpha So if Bitcoin stays here, the entire premium evaporates. That would be a 3.4% loss in one month on equity/AUM. But it gets more interesting. Against that purchased call, there is a sold call. This expires on January 2, 2026, and is of a higher strike price of $51.30. YBTC So the fund has created a long calendar call spread. Not something you would see in a typical covered call fund. This then brings us to our final position, which is one where significant premiums are sold. The fund has 45,048 contracts of the $49.72 put. YBTC For those that are unaware, cash-secured puts are identical to covered calls, adjusted for market interest rates. So if you sell a cash-secured put and in the interim park your money in a Treasury bill, you should get the same return profile as buying the stock and selling the identical strike covered call. There are some nuances depending on dividends and early exercise probabilities, but that all is not something we have to even think about with Bitcoin. So the overall position here is strange in some ways, as the fund did cash-secured puts for Bitcoin and then used that money to buy calls, partially offset by a calendar spread. Of course this is all just a moment in time, so we have no idea how this strategy has been changed over the course of the fund's history. What we do have is the pudding, where we can look for the proof. The Pudding If you run the price return profiles of IBIT and YBTC, you get a rather glaring contrast. Data by YCharts Of course the investor is now going, ""Wait, you didn't count my fat dividend checks."" We get that, and we will get to that. We always like to see this part first, as it gets to this decay principle where funds struggle to make the same dollars they did on day one as their NAV goes down. Now, there are some income investors who feel the rules of math don't apply. They seem to believe a fund with a $100 NAV per share can generate the same income even after its NAV drops 50%. But we made it past fourth grade (on the second attempt), so that is not a problem for us. Getting back to the total returns, we see that YBTC has been a real problem child here, lagging IBIT by a lot since inception. Data by YCharts That is a lot of ground to give up. The truly fascinating aspect about this fund is that it has delivered worse total returns in the recent bear market. Data by YCharts That's right. The fund has actually lagged IBIT during a rather steep drop. Verdict You couldn't pay us to speculate on Bitcoin. But if you are doing that, buy Bitcoin or IBIT and do your own covered calls. There are ways to do this intelligently that reduce your risk and improve your returns. Funds focused on generating income tend to miss the forest for the trees. There is too much emphasis on selling premiums rather than asking whether it is the right time to sell premiums. At the minimum, such funds should outperform strongly during bear markets to justify the loss of upside. You have to deliver on Sharpe if you can't deliver on Beta. Based on our opinion on Bitcoin and covered call funds and the data we have seen on this fund, we rate this a Strong Sell. Please note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult a professional who knows their objectives and constraints. Most of our articles are not written for ""buy and hold"" investors. Our articles are not written for investors who ignore capital preservation while focusing only on yield.",BTC-USD|IBIT|IBIT:CA|YBTC,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The company said it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with Sympatheia Power Fund, which is managed by Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. The transaction is expected to close within 60 days, subject to customary closing conditions. Refocus on North American HPC and AI Infrastructure Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon said the sale represents a decisive rebalancing of the company’s energy portfolio toward North America, allowing capital to be redeployed into higher-return opportunities. “This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC and AI energy infrastructure in 2026,” Gagnon said in a press release. He added that the sale of the Paso Pe site marks the culmination of a broader effort to exit Latin America and refocus the company’s management capital and operational priorities on North American power and infrastructure. Bitfarms Ditches BTC for AI After Shocking $46M Loss Bitfarms said it has increasingly positioned itself as an energy and digital infrastructure company expanding beyond bitcoin mining into high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, which it believes offer more long-term returns on invested capital. In November, the company said it will wind down its Bitcoin operations over 2026 and 2027 after posting a steep $46 million loss in the third quarter, nearly double its $24 million loss during the same period last year. @Bitfarms_io shares dropped 18% as it announced a wind-down in $BTC operations to pivot to AI infrastructure after a $46M Q3 loss. #Bitcoin #AI https://t.co/3Q7tsldFzS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Deal Structure and Payment Timeline Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer will acquire the shares of a single-purpose subsidiary that holds all operating assets related to the Paso Pe project. The proposed transaction values the site at up to $30 million. Bitfarms expects to receive $9 million in cash at closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. This amount includes a $1 million non-refundable deposit that has already been paid by the buyer. The company may receive up to an additional $21 million over the ten months following closing, contingent on the achievement of certain payment milestones. The structure of the transaction is expected to improve Bitfarms’ liquidity profile by accelerating the monetization of the asset while providing short-term financing supported by the operation. Buyer Targets Operational Continuity A representative for Sympatheia Power Fund said the acquisition supports the fund’s regional expansion strategy in crypto infrastructure and emphasized the importance of a smooth transition. “Our priority is an uninterrupted, seamless transition from day one, maintaining continuity at Paso Pe as we move into the next phase of growth,” said SPF representative Josh Murchie. Updated Energy Portfolio Post-Sale Following completion of the transaction, Bitfarms’ energy portfolio will be entirely North America–based. The company said it will operate 341 megawatts of energized capacity with an additional 430 megawatts under active development in the United States. Its total multi-year pipeline stands at 2.1 gigawatts, with roughly 90% located in the U.S. The post Bitfarms to Exit Latin America Selling 70 MW Paraguay Mining Site for Up to $30M appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitfarms|Mining|Paraguay,BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Traders on Polymarket appear cautious, while some big-name firms keep calling for big gains in 2026. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Market Odds And Trader Caution According to Polymarket prices, Bitcoin has just a 23% chance of reaching $150,000 before 2027. The odds are higher at lower targets: 47% for $120,000, 35% for $130,000 and 29% for $140,000. Traders are most comfortable with $100,000, which carries about an 80% chance. That spread shows bettors are pricing risk tightly as the clock runs toward the new year. Bitcoin closed 2025 in the red, a fact that has likely cooled some enthusiasm. Reports have disclosed that gold and silver hit fresh highs in the fourth quarter of 2025, while crypto prices held mostly flat. The old four-year halving cycle that many chartists relied on is being questioned, and that doubt is being priced in. Technical Signals Based on the latest Bitcoin price outlook, BTC is expected to climb 3% to about $91,815 by February 1, 2026. Technical signals point to a Bearish mood, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 28, reflecting Fear. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin posted gains on 15 of those days, or 50%, with price swings averaging 2%. Policy Shifts Could Change The Math US President Donald Trump is expected to name a new Federal Reserve chair soon, and many market participants are betting that interest rates will be cut afterward. That idea has already helped send precious metals higher. At the same time, regulators in Washington are pushing crypto bills such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, which backers say could give clearer rules and, in time, more institutional interest. Analysts Still Offer Bullish Targets Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly predicted that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of 2026, citing stronger institutional interest and better regulatory clarity as reasons for his bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bear Market Might Not Be New: Data Points To A 2-Month Slide Analysts at JPMorgan have suggested a theoretical Bitcoin price around $170,000 in 2026, based on a model comparing Bitcoin’s behavior to gold and assuming continued capital flows into the crypto market. Grayscale’s 2026 digital asset outlook expects Bitcoin to exceed its previous all-time high in the first half of 2026, implying a move above its record peak of around $126,000 (though not giving a specific numerical target, the implication is toward significant upward momentum). Policymakers, traders and analysts are all weighing different risks. Market prices reflect caution today, while forecasts offer a brighter view for the months ahead. Which one proves right will depend on policy moves, investor appetite and whether new trading patterns replace the cycle many thought they could count on.

The pledge arrives as South Korea’s financial regulator and central bank remain locked in a prolonged dispute over stablecoin issuance rules that have pushed comprehensive digital asset legislation into next year. According to the local report, Jeong told attendees at the Korea Exchange’s Seoul headquarters that new investment products, including virtual asset ETFs and derivatives, would be introduced as part of efforts to overcome the “ Korea Discount ” and upgrade the capital market. He also committed to deploying AI-based monitoring systems and strengthening crackdowns on stock manipulation through a joint response team. Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo. | Source: Yonhap Korea Exchange Ready, Regulators Still Divided The Korea Exchange’s readiness to launch crypto products contrasts sharply with regulatory delays that have stretched back years. The Financial Services Commission submitted a roadmap in June proposing spot crypto ETFs for late 2025, but the plan has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, South Korea’s comprehensive Digital Asset Basic Act remains stalled in 2026 after the Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea failed to reach an agreement on stablecoin governance . The central bank insists that stablecoins should be issued only by bank-led consortia, with lenders holding at least a 51% ownership stake. The FSC has resisted the fixed threshold, warning it could sideline technology firms and slow innovation in digital payments. Regulators also disagree on whether a new licensing committee is needed for stablecoin oversight. Beyond stablecoins, the draft law would introduce strict investor protections, including full-reserve custody requirements, and raise compliance standards for crypto service providers to match those in traditional finance. Initial coin offerings banned since 2017 could return under strict disclosure rules. Stablecoin issuers would be required to hold reserves entirely in bank deposits or government bonds, with 100% of those reserves entrusted to licensed custodians. South Korea’s comprehensive crypto law has been delayed to 2026 due to a dispute over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/jKP9L9n63S — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 The regulatory impasse continues despite strong political momentum from President Lee Jae-myung’s administration, which campaigned on easing digital asset restrictions. The ruling Democratic Party introduced legislation in June to amend the Capital Markets Act, expanding the definition of underlying assets for ETFs to include Bitcoin and other digital currencies. A separate bill proposed legalizing stablecoin issuance by domestic firms with a minimum capital of 500 million won. However, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has opposed the development of non-bank stablecoins due to monetary policy concerns. Enforcement Drive Continues Across Major Exchanges While policy debates drag on, enforcement actions have accelerated. The Financial Intelligence Unit imposed a ₩27.3 billion fine on Korbit in late December following approximately 22,000 anti-money laundering violations identified during October inspections. The regulator found failures in customer identification, unauthorized transactions with unregistered overseas platforms, and inadequate money-laundering risk assessments for new products. The Korbit penalty followed earlier sanctions against Upbit operator Dunamu, which received a three-month suspension on new customer accounts in February and a ₩35.2 billion fine in November. Bithumb, Coinone, and GOPAX remain under review as the FIU works through cases in inspection order, with total fines across the sector expected to reach hundreds of billions of won. South Korea is set to hit major crypto exchanges with new penalties over anti-money laundering failures, signaling a tougher enforcement phase for the industry. #SouthKorea #CryptoAML https://t.co/9r42trYMmE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Authorities are simultaneously expanding transaction monitoring requirements. The same late last month, a task force led by the FIU is reviewing whether to extend the travel rule to cover crypto transfers below 1 million won, closing a gap regulators say has enabled smurfing techniques used to evade reporting thresholds. The proposed changes would require exchanges to collect sender and recipient information for all virtual asset transfers, regardless of size. Mixed Signals From Financial Authorities The regulatory uncertainty has created contradictory guidance for asset managers. In July, the Financial Supervisory Service issued verbal warnings restricting the proportion of crypto-related stocks , such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, in domestic ETF portfolios, citing administrative guidance from 2017 that remains in effect. Several Korean ETFs already hold double-digit allocations to these companies through passive index tracking. However, industry participants argued that the restrictions create unfair advantages for US-listed crypto products while failing to prevent capital outflows. “Restricting only domestic ETFs will not stop the flow of funds, and in reality, many investors are already bypassing the market with U.S. ETFs,” one source noted at the time.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,750, meaning it closed the year 2025 below $100,000. This price action has added pressure to sentiment, and higher-timeframe indicators are pointing to growing exhaustion. According to a 3-month candlestick analysis shared on X by analyst Greeny, the way Bitcoin closed 2025 may carry deeper implications than most traders currently understand. 3-Month Bearish Engulfing Points To Weakness Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe shows the cryptocurrency just printed a large bearish engulfing candle that fully overtook the prior quarterly advance. This type of candle is rare on such a high timeframe and typically points to a decisive shift in control from buyers to sellers. The chart shared by Greeny shows that this engulfing structure formed after Bitcoin failed to hold above its 2025 highs above $120,000 in October, and this shows that the year ended in distribution. Interestingly, $106,700 is now an important level moving forward because it corresponds with the bottom of the previous 3-month candle. With Bitcoin now trading below that zone, it flips from support into a heavy resistance area for price action in Q1. Any recovery attempt in early 2026 would need to reclaim this level convincingly to avoid further rejection. Furthermore, the stochastic level near $108,000 is another important level to look at for Bitcoin’s price action in Q1 2026. According to Greeny, if the Bitcoin price closes below this zone after the first quarter, it would indicate continued downside pressure. Together, these levels form a tight ceiling overhead, meaning even strong relief rallies could struggle to transition into sustainable uptrends as we move into the new year. Bitcoin 3-month Candlestick Price Chart: @greenytrades on X Stochastic Exhaustion Points To A Possible Cycle Peak Another concerning element of Greeny’s analysis centers on the stochastic indicator. According to the analyst, this is the first time in Bitcoin’s history that the stochastic has reached the 80th percentile on the 3-month timeframe. This is otherwise notable because this is a zone generally associated with exhaustion and a local or bull cycle top. The chart also shows the red moving average crossing above the blue while sitting well below the stochastic band, a configuration Greeny interprets as confirmation of a local top. This setup is likely pointing to the end of the current bull cycle and will only be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to close above $108,000 by the end of March. Liquidity conditions across the entire crypto market tightened through late 2025 as the Central Bank of Japan maintained higher interest rates. This has led to Bitcoin underperforming compared to other notable assets, while precious metals such as gold and silver pushed to new price highs.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Specifically, respected on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez claims to have identified a Bitcoin death cross using the 10 and 50-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), per an X article published on January 1. Within the same article, the analyst explained that, in the past, such a signal preceded a BTC crash of between 53% – as in March of 2020 – and 67% – like in September of 2014. Historically, every Bitcoin $BTC death cross between the 10W and 50W SMA has led to a major correction: • Sep 2014: –67% • Jun 2018: –54% • Mar 2020: –53% • Jan 2022: –64% https://t.co/EWSDQeujJt pic.twitter.com/CEGle2ExXd — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 2, 2026 Simultaneously, Martinez explained he expects that a Bitcoin correction to between $38,000 and $50,000 – between 57% and 44% from the press time value – is likely. Still, the trading expert also noted with his BTC prediction that, rather than a purely detrimental situation, such a crash would once again turn Bitcoin into an attractive long-term investment. The pullback would all but ensure that the cryptocurrency’s upside potential is significantly greater than the downward pressure. Top commodity strategist forecasts massive 2026 Bitcoin crash On the other hand, hopeful BTC traders might have to wait until at least 2027 to again witness a major rally. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s senior commodity analyst, explained that he expects Bitcoin might crash toward $50,000 in 2026. He also revealed that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the cryptocurrency market – fell 19% in 2025, hinting at a more persistent downtrend. Bitcoin just broke a decade-long cycle Lastly, Bitcoin’s actual performance for the entire 2025 also indicates that the boom is, for the time being, over. Simultaneously, it showcased that the cryptocurrency market might be even harder to predict in the future. BTC 12-month price chart.

This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling discussions about its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this rally, from macroeconomic shifts to institutional adoption trends. Bitcoin Price Breaches a Critical Threshold The ascent of the Bitcoin price above $90,000 marks a new chapter in its volatile history. This movement is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of sustained buying pressure observed over recent weeks. Data from multiple trading platforms confirms the breakout, with Binance’s USDT pair serving as a key liquidity benchmark for the global market. Furthermore, this price action follows a period of consolidation below previous resistance levels, suggesting a fundamental shift in market sentiment. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a pattern of reaching round-number milestones that later become support zones. The journey from $70,000 to this new high involved navigating regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data releases, and shifting investor risk appetites. For instance, the asset’s performance often correlates inversely with traditional market fears, positioning it as a potential hedge for some portfolios. Therefore, the breach of $90,000 is being analyzed through both technical chart patterns and broader economic narratives. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Several interconnected factors are contributing to the current cryptocurrency rally. Primarily, renewed institutional interest has provided substantial buy-side volume. Major asset managers have continued to expand their digital asset offerings, channeling traditional capital into the space. Simultaneously, macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about currency devaluation and inflation in certain regions, have driven retail and institutional investors toward scarce digital assets. Institutional Adoption: Increased integration by payment processors and treasury allocations by public companies. Macroeconomic Hedge: Perceived as a digital store of value amid expansive fiscal policies. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements to the Bitcoin protocol enhancing its utility and security. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in key jurisdictions providing a more stable framework for investment. Moreover, the supply dynamics of Bitcoin play a crucial role. The predictable, diminishing rate of new coin issuance—a process known as the halving—creates a built-in scarcity mechanism. As adoption increases against this constrained supply, basic economic principles of supply and demand exert upward pressure on the Bitcoin price. This fundamental aspect distinguishes it from traditional fiat currencies and remains a core tenet of its investment thesis. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of volume and derivative market positioning in assessing the rally’s health. Notably, open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen alongside the price, but funding rates have remained relatively neutral. This suggests a balance between long and short positions, potentially indicating a healthier, less speculative advance compared to past parabolic moves. Experts from major financial research firms point to on-chain data, such as the growth in long-term holder supply and low exchange reserves, as signs of strong conviction among investors. Comparatively, the current rally exhibits distinct characteristics from the 2021 bull market. The table below outlines key differences: Market Aspect 2021 Cycle 2025 Cycle (Current) Primary Drivers Retail frenzy, meme coins, excessive leverage Institutional inflows, ETF products, macroeconomic narrative Leverage Levels Extremely High Moderate to High Regulatory Environment Highly uncertain Evolving with clearer frameworks On-chain Holder Behavior High exchange inflows Accumulation & withdrawal to cold storage This shift in market structure implies a potentially more mature and stable foundation for current price levels. However, analysts universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Risk management, therefore, is paramount for all market participants. The Ripple Effect Across Digital Asset Markets The breakthrough in the Bitcoin price invariably influences the broader digital asset ecosystem. Often termed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s performance frequently sets the tone for altcoins and other blockchain-based assets. In this instance, the rally has restored overall market capitalization to levels not seen in years, improving liquidity and investor confidence across the board. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have often shown correlated momentum, though the strength of this correlation can vary based on independent network developments. Simultaneously, the infrastructure surrounding cryptocurrency continues to evolve rapidly. Custodial services, regulatory-compliant exchanges, and financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs have created more accessible pathways for traditional capital. This institutional gateway effect is a critical component of the current market phase, differentiating it from earlier cycles dominated primarily by retail traders on less regulated platforms. The growing integration with legacy finance presents both opportunities for growth and new complexities regarding systemic interconnectedness. Conclusion The Bitcoin price surpassing $90,000 is a definitive milestone, reflecting a complex interplay of adoption, macroeconomics, and technological maturity. This achievement underscores Bitcoin’s persistent resilience and its growing absorption into the broader financial conversation. While volatility remains a defining feature, the market’s underlying structure appears to be evolving toward greater participation and sophistication. Ultimately, the journey toward and beyond this price point will be closely watched as a barometer for the entire digital asset class’s integration into the global economic system. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $90,040 on Binance USDT mean? This means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin (BTC) can be purchased or sold for 90,040 Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is a key pricing pair that reflects real-time global supply and demand. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin’s price is rising? Primary drivers include increased institutional investment through new financial products, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, continued adoption as a payment method, and its fixed, scarce supply schedule which contrasts with expansive monetary policy. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s current rally compare to 2021? The current rally appears more institutionally driven, with significant capital flowing through regulated ETFs and corporate treasuries. In contrast, the 2021 peak was characterized by higher retail leverage and excitement around meme coins and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Q4: Is Bitcoin’s price sustainable at this level? Sustainability depends on continued adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. While on-chain data and institutional interest provide a stronger foundation now, cryptocurrency markets are still young and subject to high volatility and unpredictable corrections. Q5: What is the impact of Bitcoin’s price on other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the overall market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin price typically increases capital flows into the entire crypto sector, boosting the prices of major altcoins. However, individual project fundamentals ultimately determine long-term performance relative to Bitcoin.

This surprising turn of events, reported by DL News in early 2025, follows his November 2024 sentencing to five years for orchestrating one of cryptocurrency’s most infamous thefts. Consequently, his release under the U.S. First Step Act raises profound questions about justice, rehabilitation, and the evolving legal landscape for digital asset crimes. Bitfinex Hacker Early Release Details and Legal Mechanism The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Ilya Lichtenstein’s early release this week. Authorities applied provisions of the First Step Act of 2018. This bipartisan federal law specifically aims to reduce recidivism. Furthermore, it promotes inmate rehabilitation through earned time credits. Lichtenstein reportedly qualified for these credits by participating in prison programming. His original five-year sentence stemmed from a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges connected directly to the 2016 Bitfinex security breach. Prosecutors originally charged Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, in February 2022. Their arrest followed a multi-year investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Agents traced the movement of 119,754 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the theft, the cryptocurrency was worth approximately $71 million. However, by the time of their arrest, its value had ballooned to a staggering $4.5 billion. This case remains one of the largest financial seizures in U.S. history. The 2016 Bitfinex Breach and Investigation Timeline Understanding the early release requires examining the original crime’s scale. The Bitfinex hack occurred on August 2, 2016. Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the exchange’s multi-signature wallet service. They successfully initiated over 2,000 unauthorized transactions. These transactions drained customer and corporate funds. The exchange immediately suspended all trading. It also announced a 36% socialized loss across all user accounts. For nearly six years, the stolen funds remained dormant. Then, in 2022, blockchain analytics and traditional investigative work converged. The IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit and HSI followed a complex trail. They linked the funds to wallets controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. A court-authorized search of their cloud storage accounts revealed private keys. These keys directly accessed the wallets holding the stolen Bitcoin. Key Events in the Bitfinex Case Date Event Aug 2, 2016 Bitfinex hack occurs; 119,754 BTC stolen. Feb 8, 2022 Lichtenstein and Morgan arrested in New York. Aug 2022 Both plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy. Nov 2024 Lichtenstein sentenced to 5 years in prison. Early 2025 Early release granted under First Step Act. The investigation showcased unprecedented collaboration. Agencies combined blockchain forensic tools with classic financial sleuthing. This approach set a new standard for prosecuting cryptocurrency crimes. First Step Act Provisions and Application to Cybercrime The First Step Act represents a significant shift in federal sentencing policy. Its primary goals include: Reducing mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenses. Expanding early release programs through earned time credits. Increasing rehabilitation programming within federal prisons. Improving conditions and reducing recidivism rates. Inmates earn credits by participating in Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) programs. These programs address needs like vocational training, education, and substance abuse treatment. Lichtenstein’s eligibility suggests he engaged with such programming. The Act does not distinguish between crime types for credit eligibility. Therefore, non-violent financial crimes like money laundering qualify. This application to a high-profile cybercrime case is particularly noteworthy. Impact on Cryptocurrency Security and Legal Precedents Lichtenstein’s early release sends ripples through the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, it tests the deterrent effect of prosecution for digital asset theft. Secondly, it highlights the tension between punishment and rehabilitation for technical crimes. The case already established several key legal precedents: Asset Forfeiture: The government successfully seized and sold billions in stolen crypto. Jurisdiction: U.S. courts asserted authority over crimes involving globally dispersed digital assets. Investigation Methods: The use of blockchain analytics as evidence gained judicial acceptance. Security experts note the hack forced major exchanges to overhaul their protocols. Today, most leading platforms use sophisticated cold storage solutions. They also employ multi-party computation (MPC) for key management. The Bitfinex incident remains a cautionary tale for the entire industry. Expert Analysis on Sentencing and Release Legal scholars specializing in cyberlaw offer critical perspectives. Professor Elena Carter of Stanford Law School notes, “The First Step Act focuses on rehabilitation for non-violent offenders. The court likely viewed the technical nature of the crime as non-violent, despite its massive financial scale.” Meanwhile, blockchain forensic analyst David Chen observes, “This early release doesn’t diminish the investigative breakthrough. The real victory was tracing and recovering the funds, which returned value to victims.” The case also involved Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, a rapper and entrepreneur. She received a shorter sentence and was released earlier. Their combined story of tech savvy, money laundering through complex transactions, and unconventional public personas captured global media attention. Conclusion The early release of Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein under the First Step Act concludes a landmark chapter in cryptocurrency legal history. This case demonstrated the formidable reach of U.S. law enforcement into the blockchain. It also tested new sentencing reforms on a high-stakes financial crime. Ultimately, the recovery of $4.5 billion in stolen assets stands as the investigation’s enduring legacy. The industry now watches how this precedent influences future prosecutions of digital asset theft and money laundering. FAQs Q1: What was the First Step Act, and why did it apply to Ilya Lichtenstein? The First Step Act is a 2018 U.S. federal law designed to reform sentencing and promote inmate rehabilitation. It applied to Lichtenstein because he qualified for earned time credits by participating in prison programming aimed at reducing recidivism, and his crime was classified as non-violent. Q2: How much Bitcoin was originally stolen in the 2016 Bitfinex hack? The hackers stole 119,754 Bitcoin from Bitfinex in August 2016. At the time of the theft, this was worth about $71 million. By the time of the arrest in 2022, the value had appreciated to approximately $4.5 billion. Q3: What happened to the stolen Bitcoin after the seizure? The U.S. government successfully seized the vast majority of the stolen Bitcoin. It then sold portions of the cryptocurrency through authorized auctions and market sales. The proceeds are held as recovered assets, with processes in place for potential victim restitution. Q4: How does this early release affect future cryptocurrency crime prosecutions? Legal experts believe the core precedent—successful investigation, seizure, and conviction—remains intact. The early release reflects sentencing policy, not investigative failure. It may, however, influence plea negotiations and sentencing arguments in future digital asset cases. Q5: What role did Ilya Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, play in the crime? Heather Morgan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and defraud the United States. Prosecutors alleged she helped launder the stolen funds through complex transactions, shell companies, and false invoices. She received a sentence shorter than Lichtenstein’s and was released earlier.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,961.21 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This sudden Bitcoin price movement has captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, prompting a deep dive into the underlying market mechanics and historical context. The drop represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and introduces fresh volatility into the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The descent below $89,000 marks a clear technical breakdown. Consequently, market participants are now scrutinizing order book liquidity and exchange flows. Major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken show similar price action, confirming a broad-based sell-off. Furthermore, the 24-hour trading volume has spiked by approximately 35%, indicating heightened activity. This Bitcoin price decline follows a period of consolidation just above the $90,000 psychological barrier. Market data reveals increased selling pressure from large wallet addresses, often called ‘whales.’ Historically, such movements often correlate with broader financial conditions. For instance, the current macroeconomic backdrop includes shifting expectations around central bank policies. Analysts frequently compare present volatility to past cycles, like the Q2 2024 correction. A short-term sell-off can sometimes establish a stronger foundation for future growth. Therefore, understanding the immediate catalysts is crucial for a complete market picture. Technical Indicators and On-Chain Data Key technical levels provide further insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory. The 50-day moving average, a closely watched metric, now acts as dynamic resistance. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory. On-chain analytics from Glassnode show a net outflow from exchanges, suggesting some investors are moving holdings to cold storage. This ‘hodling’ behavior often signals long-term conviction despite short-term price pain. The network’s hash rate remains robust, underscoring fundamental security strength. Analyzing Potential Catalysts for the Decline Several interrelated factors may have contributed to this cryptocurrency market downturn. First, regulatory developments continue to create uncertainty in major economies. Second, profit-taking after a sustained rally above $85,000 was a widely anticipated risk. Third, movements in traditional markets, like bond yields or equity indices, can trigger correlated sell-offs in digital assets. Finally, leveraged positions being liquidated on derivatives exchanges can exacerbate downward momentum. It is essential to distinguish between causation and correlation. For example, not every market move has a single, identifiable news trigger. Often, a confluence of minor factors creates the conditions for a shift. Market sentiment, measured by tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, had been in ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. A reversion to a more neutral or fearful reading is a common market-clearing event. Macroeconomic Pressure: Shifts in inflation data or interest rate expectations. Overleveraged Markets: Cascade of long position liquidations on futures platforms. Regulatory Headlines: News flow concerning digital asset legislation or enforcement actions. Profit-Taking: Natural sell pressure after a multi-week appreciation cycle. Historical Volatility and Bitcoin Market Cycles Bitcoin’s history is defined by volatility. A pullback of 5-15% during a bull market phase is statistically normal. For context, the 2021 cycle saw over a dozen corrections exceeding 10% before reaching its all-time high. This perspective helps investors maintain a long-term view. The current Bitcoin price action fits within established patterns of advance, consolidation, and correction. Seasoned analysts often view these dips as potential entry points rather than signals of a trend reversal, provided core fundamentals remain intact. Comparing asset classes highlights Bitcoin’s unique risk profile. Traditional safe-haven assets like gold typically exhibit lower volatility. However, Bitcoin’s potential for asymmetric returns attracts a different investor profile. The digital gold narrative persists, but its trading patterns remain distinct. This latest move serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent price discovery process, which is often volatile and inefficient. Expert Commentary and Market Sentiment Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize context. ‘Market corrections are healthy,’ notes a veteran trader from a major digital asset fund. ‘They flush out weak leverage and reset derivatives markets.’ Another analyst points to on-chain metrics showing accumulation by long-term holders during dips. This behavior suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Sentiment on social trading platforms has quickly shifted from bullish to cautious, reflecting the fast-paced nature of crypto markets. Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The Bitcoin price decline has a pronounced ripple effect. Altcoins, which often correlate with BTC, have generally moved in tandem, with some experiencing more severe losses. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dipped accordingly. However, this correlation sometimes decouples, with select projects showcasing independent strength. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) trading volumes may see secondary impacts if the downturn persists. Institutional investment flows, tracked through products like Bitcoin ETFs, will be a key metric to watch in the coming days. Sustained inflows during a price drop could signal strong institutional conviction. Conversely, outflows might indicate a broader risk-off move. The interaction between spot market selling and derivatives market liquidations creates a complex feedback loop that analysts will study closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $89,000 represents a significant moment in the 2025 market cycle. This movement underscores the volatile and interconnected nature of digital asset markets. While short-term price action captures headlines, the long-term narrative around Bitcoin’s adoption, technological development, and role as a digital store of value remains multifaceted. Investors are advised to focus on risk management, fundamental research, and a time horizon that aligns with their financial goals. The coming days will be critical for observing whether this level holds as support or if further downside exploration occurs. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $89,000? The decline likely resulted from a combination of profit-taking after a rally, liquidations of leveraged long positions, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. It is a typical correction within a volatile market. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual strategy. Some view corrections as potential buying opportunities, but timing the market is notoriously difficult. Conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q3: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major altcoins have high correlation with Bitcoin and often move in the same direction, at least in the short term. The entire crypto market cap typically reacts to significant BTC movements. Q4: What key level should traders watch next? Traders are monitoring the $88,000 and $85,000 levels as potential next supports. A reclaim of $90,000 would be viewed as a bullish signal for a potential recovery. Q5: Does this price drop change Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? A single price correction rarely alters long-term fundamental theses based on adoption, scarcity, and utility. Volatility is an inherent feature of the asset class, and long-term investors often look through short-term fluctuations.

The facility will be acquired by the Sympatheia Power Fund, a crypto infrastructure investor. Bitfarms will sell its 70 MW facility in Paraguay, as it rebalances its portfolio of reliable centers and focuses on North America. With the sale, Bitfarms leaves its South American mining operations. The Paso Pe site in Paraguay is expected to transfer within 60 days, under the management of the Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. ‘ I’m pleased to announce the strategic sale of our Paso Pe site and decisive rebalancing of our energy portfolio to 100% North American. This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC/AI energy infrastructure in 2026, where we believe we will be able to generate much stronger returns on our invested capital with HPC/AI, ’ said Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon. Bitfarms is a mid-range mining company with 19.5 EH/s in total BTC mining power. The company is also within the top 100 of BTC treasury holders, retaining 1,827 BTC from its mining activity. The Paraguay center will go toward Sympatheia Power Fund’s expansion plans for Latin America. The mining center will retain operations, with no outages during the transfer of ownership. Bitfarms sells BTC mining center for $30M Bitfarms will sell the Paso Pe BTC mining facility at a $30M valuation, with $9M in cash and up to $21M over a 10-month period. After the deal, Bitfarms will focus solely on North American energy assets while improving its liquidity profile for further expansion. Bitfarms negotiated a $300M long-term debt facility in April 2025 as part of its energy expansion plans. Bitfarms retains 341 MW in energy capacity, with another 430 MW in active development. The multi-year plan is to reach a total of 2.1 GW in data centers, of which 90% will be based in the USA. Bitfarms has been on an expansion track since 2017, and is one of the leaders in North American mining infrastructure. Bitfarms benefits from AI data center boom The sale arrives at a time when Bitcoin mining operations are often converted to high-uptime AI centers, based on existing contracts for reliable electricity. Following the deal announcement, BITF shares were trading at $2.96 (3.93 CAD), up over 32% net for the past year. The period coincided with revenue growth for BITF, as the miner benefited from the growing prices. In early 2026, BTC miners are still operating at near peak capacity, despite the distressing market conditions. Even smaller mining companies are viewed as potential bets with high returns. BITF is expected to break out based on its ongoing data center plans. BITF is competing with other recently hot mining companies like Riot and IREN, with stocks rising despite the slower BTC market growth. Get seen where it counts.

The cryptocurrency’s price actions have been choppy and uncertain for several weeks. It dipped to a local low of $84,500 on December 19, shortly after the US CPI numbers for November came out, but quickly tightened its trading range. In the following ten days or so, it stood between $90,500 and $86,500. It tried to take down the upper boundary on at least three occasions since then, but each attempt was met with an immediate rejection and a subsequent retracement to the lower boundary. The current business week began similarly, as BTC spiked to $90,500, where the bears stepped up and pushed it south to under $87,000. The bulls intercepted the move and provided an immediate relief rally to $88,000. Sideways action continued in the following days, but BTC ultimately closed 2025 below $88,000, which was a 6-7% yearly decline. January 1 was expectedly a dull trading day, but bitcoin went on the offensive earlier today. It tapped $90,000 once again, only to be stopped and driven south by a grand and a half. Nevertheless, it has managed to bounce off and now sits above $89,000. This means that it’s over 2% up weekly, but its market cap has declined by 0.6% weekly as most alts have marked bigger gains since last Friday. These include ETH, BNB, SOL, and ADA, all of which are up by 5-6%. DOGE has risen by more than 9%, and so has ZEC. XMR, HYPE, and BCH are among the few alts in the red weekly.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-ignore-xrp-at-your-peril-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Crypto markets often hide the most important moves behind quiet accumulation rather than flashy headlines. While retail chatter and media narratives dominate daily attention, institutional actors frequently position themselves well ahead of obvious catalysts . XRP now sits at one of these critical inflection points, signaling that large-scale players may be preparing for a major market shift. The insight came from X Finance Bull, who shared recent institutional flow data on X, highlighting XRP’s unusual stability compared to other top cryptocurrencies. According to the analysis, while Bitcoin and Ethereum saw billions in outflows over November and December 2025, XRP maintained steady net inflows, signaling deliberate accumulation rather than retail-driven speculation. Institutional Flows Highlight Strategic Positioning X Finance Bull pointed out that Bitcoin experienced $3.48 billion in outflows in November and $1.09 billion in December, while Ethereum lost $1.42 billion and $616 million in the same period. XRP, however, saw only $666 million in November and $499 million in December, all positive net inflows. These numbers suggest that institutions actively moved capital into XRP while other major assets faced liquidity drains. IGNORE $XRP AT YOUR PERIL INSTITUTIONS ARE FRONT-RUNNING THE MARKET If you still think ETFs are only about Bitcoin and Ethereum, you’re missing what’s right in front of you Bitcoin saw outflows of $3.48B in November and $1.09B in December. Ethereum lost $1.42B in… https://t.co/gC79IXRRoW pic.twitter.com/V35OxMkYFM — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 1, 2026 This pattern demonstrates more than casual interest. Institutions anticipate regulatory clarity, infrastructure upgrades, and new liquidity corridors, often positioning themselves before these changes reach the public eye. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that professional investors view it as a strategically vital asset in the emerging digital finance ecosystem. ETFs and XRP’s Overlooked Potential Many investors still associate crypto ETFs primarily with Bitcoin and Ethereum. X Finance Bull emphasizes that this narrative overlooks a critical development: institutional capital increasingly targets XRP as regulatory frameworks and market infrastructure evolve. Unlike retail-driven surges, these flows reflect structured positioning in anticipation of XRP’s adoption as a bridge asset in regulated payments and cross-border settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This approach underlines XRP’s growing independence from short-term market sentiment. Institutions prioritize utility, liquidity, and compliance over hype, and XRP now benefits from these long-term fundamentals. Following Capital Flows Over Headlines The data reinforces a key principle: flows often lead markets. While headlines highlight trending stories, institutional movements reveal where smart money expects value to materialize. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that investors are betting on its future as an essential infrastructure asset, rather than short-term gains. As financial institutions integrate blockchain solutions and liquidity corridors expand, XRP stands poised for broader adoption. Ignoring these signals risks missing early positioning in what may become one of the most structurally significant crypto assets in the next market cycle. By tracking institutional flows rather than narratives, market participants gain a clearer perspective on XRP’s strategic importance and its potential to outperform other major cryptocurrencies.

BTC could sell off immediately after the January FOMC meeting, or even sooner. By comparing BTC to changes in factors that influence real yield trajectories, I assert that BTC’s latest rally has been running on borrowed time since September. Regulatory optimism and one-off positive events may support BTC in the short run, but they are unlikely to alter the broader trajectory. This article concludes a three-part BTC series examining dominance trends, money supply dynamics, and real yields—all of which collectively, and independently, point towards a BTC bear phase. Recently, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management increased exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which could be seen as an indication that the coin may rally further. While I believe in BTC’s long-term growth prospects, in line with Ms. Wood's target of $650,000 to $1.5M by 2030 , I don’t believe her recent BTC and related portfolio additions were to benefit from a short-term rally because my analysis of dominance numbers and money supply in previous articles indicated otherwise. Below is a summary of those two articles, which you may skip and move to the next section if you’ve been following my work. On December 18, 2025, my article titled “ Exit 200%+ Yield MSTY - And Don't Look Back ” argued that dominance numbers are signaling a crypto risk-off sentiment. Precisely, the dominance of BTC hasn’t changed since early November, whereas the dominance of altcoins has diminished. In that timeframe, though, stablecoin's dominance has shot up, indicating that many investors now prefer holding cash over crypto. Then, my article titled “ IBIT: The Risk Of Bitcoin's Decline To $30K ,” published on December 22, 2025, established that there’s a strong correlation between expected money supply changes and BTC. I advocated that the Fed may not embark on any meaningful quantitative easing in the coming years. In the absence of such M2 tailwinds, investors will likely rotate out of crypto. More Evidence In my view, those two articles should’ve been enough for readers to reconsider their BTC positions, especially if their entry price was more than $30,000—my price target. Even still, I’ll provide further evidence to support my assertion that BTC is headed south. To that end, please consider the chart below, which plots BTC prices against changes in real yields (referred to as RYC going forward). BTC-USD vs. 10-Year TIPS YoY % Change (Weekly, Sep 2014 – Dec 2025) (Author's Work - Data from Yahoo and FRED) From a surface-level view, the inverse relationship between BTC and RYC is quite evident: when RYC falls, BTC rallies, and vice versa. Also, BTC rallies usually lag RYCs. That inverse relationship exists because BTC is a non-yielding asset, and when yields are expected to rise, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets goes up, diminishing their attractiveness. The pertinent question then is: what drives RYC? Below is a quick rundown of every RYC directional pivot since the pandemic: RYC collapsed at the start of the pandemic due to the Fed’s zero rates and QE-until-necessary policies in response to the looming threat of a severe pandemic-induced recession and deflation. RYC started accelerating in early 2021, driven by rate hike expectations, which in turn were driven by inflation and growth expectations that had risen based on the possibility of vaccine rollouts. Inflation peaked in mid-2022, indicating that the Fed was approaching terminal rates. An expectation that gained further credence when the yield curve inverted in October 2022 , raising fears of an imminent recession. Consequently, RYC commenced a downward leg at the end of 2022, even though the Fed continued to hike rates until July 2023, because changes in both inflation and GDP trended downward. Inflation reached a point of stabilization at the start of 2024, when it fell to ~2.6%, quite close to the Fed's target—an event coupled with a flattening of the GDP change curve as well. But GDP had softened more than anticipated, raising fears and expectations of a weak economy, causing RYC to dive deeper. To manage that adverse situation, the Fed cut rates by 50 bps on September 18, 2024, and then delivered two more cuts in the same year. RYC changed direction in October 2024—when the market ascertained that the economy would be stable and GDP growth would normalize after the Fed's actions. Finally, RYC pivoted downward slightly at the end of 2024 when market participants believed the economy had digested the stimulatory effects of rate cuts. With all that information presented in this section, it is safe to assert that changes in expectations of long-term inflation and growth are among the primary drivers of RYC trajectories and thus, BTC cycles. Important Nuance Note that I have used the words “RYC trajectories” and “expectations of long-term inflation and growth” intentionally because trajectories and expectations are what matter, rather than singular events. If this nuance isn’t taken into consideration, investors may enter or exit positions at inopportune times. One such inopportune time was when rates were cut in October 2025, leading to only a slight drop in RYC but a big drawdown in BTC ($110,000 to roughly $85,000), i.e., the inverse relation between the two didn’t hold. That decoupling occurred because there were no changes in expectations of inflation and/or growth. Plus, Powell said that another rate cut in December is not a “foregone conclusion,” indicating a possible end to the rate cut cycle of 2025 and a stable economy going forward. In fact, it can be said that BTC’s long-haul price rally has been living on borrowed time since the September FOMC meeting, when Powell mentioned that cuts going forward would be more of a risk management initiative because the summary of economic projections hasn’t changed much (reference: Quote 1 in the appendix). Fed’s Path Forward Historically, the Fed has implemented insurance cuts multiple times, totaling 75 bps in all cases. (Source for rate cuts history: Federal Funds Rate History 1990 to 2026 ). In 2019, to manage the adverse effects of a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. In 2002, to further stimulate anemic economic recovery following the Dot-Com crisis. In 1998, to manage risks arising from the Asian Currency Crisis and the collapse of LTCM. In 1995, to stimulate a stagnant and weaker-than-expected labor market. Rates have already been cut by 75 bps since September 2025, which is why it's reasonable to assume that the Fed Funds rate won't change for the foreseeable future. An assertion further supported by the Fed’s latest economic projections , indicating a 2.4% PCE inflation, a GDP growth rate of 2.3%, and a Fed Funds rate of 3.4% for 2026. Moreover, Powell's statements from the October and December FOMC press conferences clearly indicate that if it weren’t for tariffs, inflation would be very close to the Fed’s target of 2% (reference: Quotes 2 and 3 in the appendix). Finally, he has said many times, and something I discussed in an article here , that tariff-induced inflation is a one-off event whose detrimental effects diminish over time. In summary, inflation is projected to subside in the coming months, GDP is projected to grow, and the Fed has delivered most of its rate cuts. Thus, RYC won’t experience any dramatic trajectory changes. Conclusion In my article on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) referenced/linked earlier, I stated that BTC will bottom between $30,000 and $20,000. To reach that level, however, it’ll experience multiple dramatic drawdowns. As mentioned before, I believe that BTC’s last strong sell-off, which caused it to drop from around $110,000 to roughly $85,000 within weeks, occurred because of normalization of growth and inflation, even though a rate cut was delivered. Therefore, I expect another drawdown, causing BTC to drop to its next resistance level of around $60,000, to occur after the next Fed meeting when an end to the current rate-cut cycle is officially announced—eliminating any doubts about the economy deteriorating further. Could the drop happen earlier? Yes, it depends on the payroll numbers and is quite tricky to understand. In my opinion, market participants, as of now, are quite convinced that there won't be any further rate cuts. But there's also some lingering doubt left along the lines of “What if things get worse in the labor market?” If, however, payroll numbers for December were to present a positive surprise, those doubts would be decisively eliminated, along with doubts about the end of the rate cuts cycle. In such a scenario, BTC may crash before the next FOMC meeting. The primary risk to my thesis is what I’ve already stated in other articles: singular events, such as regulatory changes and institutional participation, serving as tailwinds for BTC. I’d, however, like to further qualify that assertion by adding that such changes may only lead to ephemeral BTC rallies because its long-haul use as an extreme inflation hedge would be irrelevant in the coming economic environment. Lastly, it goes without saying that this ‘strong sell’ recommendation is not only for BTC but also for ETFs derived from it, such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), or corporations that are directly correlated to BTC prices, such as Strategy ( MSTR ). Appendix: Quotes From FOMC Press Conferences Quote 1: September press conference (pages 6 and 7): Yeah, I think you could think of this, in a way, as a risk-management cut, because if you look at the SEP, actually the projections for growth this year and next actually ticked up just a little bit and inflation and unemployment didn’t really move. So what’s different now? What’s different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market. You’ve seen—you know, we were looking at 150,000 jobs a month at the time of the last meeting, and now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers. And I didn’t—I don’t want to put too much emphasis on payroll job creation, but it’s just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off. And that tells you that it’s time to take that into account in our, you know, in our policy. Quote 2: October press conference (page 11): One is that inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2 percent goal. We estimate—people have different estimates of what that is, but it might be five- or six-tenths, and so if it’s 2.8, then core PCE, not including tariffs, might be 2.3 or 2.4, in that range, something like that. Quote 3: December press conference (page 23): And I think the evidence is kind of growing that what's happening here is services inflation coming down and that's offset by increases in goods, and that goods inflation is entirely in sectors where there are tariffs. So that does build on the story. And, so far, it's only a story that this is -- that the goods inflation, which is really the source of the excess at this point, that that -- almost more than half the source of the excess inflation is goods -- is tariffs.",BTC-USD|IBIT|BITO|FBTC|GBTC|MSTR|IBIT:CA|MSTR:CA|MSTY|MSTY:CA,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

However, despite its poor performance in Q4 last year, a crypto analyst has projected four new upside targets for BTC in 2026. The analyst has highlighted an emerging technical pattern and key resistance levels that traders and investors should closely monitor. Bitcoin Expected To Revisit $90,000 Levels In 2026 Market technician Jonathan Carter has shared four new price targets for Bitcoin this year, taking on a bullish stance despite the broader market downtrend and ongoing volatility. The analyst first highlighted a technical structure on BTC’s 8-hour chart that suggests a major price move is coming. Related Reading: People Are Not Ready For Bitcoin; Analyst Reveals What’s Coming Next According to his chart analysis, Bitcoin has been forming a symmetrical triangle since December last year and is now approaching a critical decision point as the pattern nears its apex. Notably, this triangle structure has often preceded aggressive directional moves, suggesting that the market may be gearing up for bullish turnover . For his first bullish target, the analyst expects Bitcoin to surge to $94,000, viewing this area as an initial reaction level following a complete breakout above the $80,000 region. Notably, the chart shows that the $94,000 target was a previous consolidation and minor rejection point during earlier market phases. A move into this area would signal that buyers are successfully pushing prices beyond short-term resistance. Closely following that level is the $97,500 target. The chart indicates that this region previously acted as a pivot where the price struggled to maintain momentum. If Bitcoin holds above $97,000, it could also indicate strengthening bullish control and increase the probability of continuation. Carter’s chart shows that both buyers and sellers have been active , but neither side has maintained dominance, resulting in narrower price swings. This balance suggests that the market is consolidating and may be waiting for a trigger to resolve the structure. Although BTC continues to trade around $88,000, Carter believes the cryptocurrency’s broader structure favors an upside continuation. However, he notes that a confirmation is required before the market can break out and recover from the downtrend. Analyst Sets BTC’s Next Two Targets Above $100,000 For his final two targets, Carter has forecasted a move above the $100,000 psychological level . If Bitcoin successfully clears the triangle resistance, the next major objective is the $100,500 level. Beyond that, the analyst has forecasted a final upside target of around $106,000, representing a roughly 19% surge from current levels. Carter has also marked $106,000 as a sell zone , suggesting that a move into this region would likely attract profit taking , but reaching it would confirm a strong bullish expansion from the triangle pattern. Notably, a clearly marked support zone sits near the lower boundary of the triangle around the $80,000 range. This area has been tested multiple times and continues to hold, reinforcing the validity of Bitcoin’s structure.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Jonathan Carter|Profit-taking|Symmetrical Triangle Formation,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56736664,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258031,1767372012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: A Historic Surge Past the $90,000 Milestone",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-surges-past-90000-milestone/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: A Historic Surge Past the $90,000 Milestone In a landmark moment for digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) has decisively broken through the $90,000 barrier, trading at $90,037 on the Binance USDT market as of today, March 21, 2025. This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling intense discussion among investors and analysts globally. Consequently, this price action prompts a deeper examination of the converging factors behind this rally and its potential implications for the broader financial landscape. Bitcoin Price Achieves a New Zenith The ascent past $90,000 marks Bitcoin’s highest valuation since its last major cycle peak. According to data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the move was characterized by strong buying volume and occurred during Asian and European trading hours. This price level consolidates gains from a multi-week uptrend that began in early 2025. Furthermore, the rally appears broad-based, with increased institutional activity noted across major regulated exchanges. Several immediate catalysts contributed to this bullish momentum. Firstly, recent regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has reduced market uncertainty. Secondly, continued adoption by traditional finance (TradFi) firms for treasury reserves has provided a steady demand baseline. Finally, macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns in several economies, have renewed interest in Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties. Analyzing the Drivers of the Cryptocurrency Rally This rally is not an isolated event but the result of sustained fundamental developments. The network’s underlying health metrics remain robust. For instance, the hash rate—a measure of computational security—continues to set new records, reinforcing network integrity. Simultaneously, development activity on scaling solutions like the Lightning Network has accelerated, improving transaction efficiency and utility. Market structure has also evolved significantly. The table below contrasts key metrics from the previous cycle peak to the current environment: Metric Previous Cycle (~$69k Peak) Current Environment (~$90k) Futures Open Interest Extremely High, Leveraged More Balanced, Less Speculative Spot ETF Flows Not Available Consistent Net Inflows On-Chain Holder Behavior High Exchange Inflows Increased Long-Term Holding (HODLing) Institutional Custody Growing Widespread and Mature This data suggests a more mature and structurally sound market foundation supporting current prices. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of macro-economic factors. “The breach of $90,000 is technically significant,” notes a market strategist from a major investment bank, citing on-chain data that shows a large volume of Bitcoin moved into wallets with no history of spending. “We are observing a fundamental shift where Bitcoin is increasingly treated as a strategic asset rather than a purely speculative one.” Meanwhile, blockchain data firms report that the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains near all-time highs. This metric, often called the “HODL wave,” indicates strong conviction among long-term investors. Such behavior typically reduces available sell-side pressure, a crucial factor for sustaining price advances. The Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to this point provides essential context. Each major cycle has been defined by a new wave of adoption and a re-rating of its fundamental value proposition. The 2020-2021 cycle was largely driven by institutional discovery and pandemic-era fiscal policy. The current cycle, however, seems intertwined with global monetary policy normalization and Bitcoin’s integration into legacy financial infrastructure through spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Looking forward, several key levels and factors will be watched closely: Technical Resistance: The $95,000 to $100,000 zone is viewed as the next major psychological hurdle. Macro Sensitivity: How Bitcoin correlates with traditional risk assets like tech stocks in a changing interest rate environment. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing policy frameworks in the EU, UK, and US will impact market access and stability. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements in privacy, scalability, and smart contract functionality via layers like Taproot and sidechains. Ultimately, the market’s ability to hold gains above previous all-time highs will be a critical test of this new valuation paradigm. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $90,000 represents a pivotal chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This milestone reflects a complex interplay of improved market structure, deepening institutional participation, and enduring macroeconomic narratives. While volatility remains an inherent feature, the current price discovery above previous cycle highs suggests a market maturing through successive phases of adoption. The focus for investors and observers now shifts to whether this **Bitcoin price** level can form a durable foundation for the next stage of growth in the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly caused Bitcoin to jump above $90,000? A1: The move resulted from a combination of factors: sustained inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, positive regulatory developments in several countries, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty driving demand for alternative assets. It was not a single event but a convergence of sustained bullish catalysts. Q2: How does the current market differ from when Bitcoin last hit a record high? A2: Key differences include significantly higher institutional custody, the presence of regulated spot ETFs creating constant buy-side pressure, lower leverage in derivatives markets, and a larger proportion of the supply being held long-term, indicating stronger investor conviction. Q3: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this rally? A3: Investment timing depends entirely on individual risk tolerance and goals. Financial advisors universally recommend that cryptocurrency should only constitute a small, allocated portion of a diversified portfolio, never funds needed for essentials. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Q4: What are the main risks to Bitcoin’s price at this level? A4: Primary risks include sudden, restrictive regulatory changes in a major economy, a sharp reversal in global liquidity conditions, a critical security flaw discovered in the protocol, or a prolonged downturn in traditional markets causing a “risk-off” sell-off across all asset classes. Q5: What is the significance of the $90,000 price point? A5: Beyond being a round number, breaking decisively above the previous all-time high (around $69,000) is a major technical and psychological achievement. It confirms a new bullish market cycle and shifts the entire historical price range, potentially attracting a new wave of institutional and retail interest.

Investors have begun aggressively buying the dip to start the new year, shaking off the stagnation that characterised the final weeks of December. Over the past 24 hours, the total crypto market cap regained its footing above the psychological $3 trillion mark, having rallied roughly 2% to $3.12 trillion at press time. Market sentiment showed signs of relief as well, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbing 8 points to 36. While this still sits in “Fear” territory, it marks a significant move out of the Extreme Fear doldrums that persisted throughout the holiday season. Altcoins were the biggest beneficiaries of this liquidity injection, with meme coins stealing the show throughout the day. Led by Pepe Coin (PEPE), which saw double-digit gains, the sector outperformed the broader market. Other major meme assets, including Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), were also trading firmly in the green at the time of publication, fueled by a renewed appetite for high-beta plays. Why is Bitcoin price and crypto market up today? Bitcoin and the overall crypto market’s rally today has been driven by a combination of seasonal trends and a resurgence in global risk appetite. One of the clearest factors at play is the “January Effect,” as investors who closed out loss-heavy positions in December for tax purposes are now redeploying capital into the market. This new-year reset has historically sparked inflows, but it’s been especially pronounced this time given the steep end-of-year selloffs. Bitcoin price, for instance, had pulled back nearly 30% from its October peak of $126,000, and many viewed the $85,000 to $87,000 zone as a compelling long-term support range. Today’s move suggests those dip-buying efforts are now materializing with more conviction, aided by whale activity. On-chain data over the past two days has shown a notable uptick in large-holder accumulation, adding weight behind the bounce. At the same time, open interest in futures has risen more than 2%, topping $130 billion, which is a clear nod that leveraged traders are entering the market with bullish bets. This kind of futures-led growth alongside spot price movement tends to confirm underlying momentum. Beyond the crypto-native catalysts, global risk appetite has also returned. Equity futures for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have pointed to a positive 2026 open, as traders begin to price in the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts by March. The ongoing wave of IPOs and improving macro outlook have pulled traditional investors back into high-growth sectors, and crypto often sits high on that list when risk sentiment turns favorable. There’s also a structural tailwind from regulatory clarity that began to take shape late last year. With the GENIUS Act setting clearer guidelines for digital assets and stablecoin frameworks becoming more predictable, institutional participants have more confidence navigating the space. This is already playing out in spot ETF flows, where selling pressure in both Bitcoin and Ethereum has begun to subside. Even meme coins have helped drive sentiment, as traders rotate into riskier assets in search of higher short-term upside. The rally across tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB has added to the sense that capital is flowing more freely again. What’s next for Bitcoin price? For Bitcoin bulls, reclaiming the psychological support level at $90,000 would be a strong validation point that could open the door to further upside. Since mid-December, this zone has acted as a key ceiling, with each rally attempt falling short of a clean break. A decisive push above it could reset the narrative and give traders confidence to begin positioning for a potential return to six-figure territory in the months ahead. Per the 24-hour liquidation heatmap, Bitcoin’s latest rally has clearly forced a large wave of short liquidations, particularly clustered near the $88,000 to $90,000 range. See below: Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The visual density in these upper bands, coupled with real-time data showing $271.65 million in total liquidations, of which $217.82 million were shorts, points to how this move has caught bearish traders off guard. Ethereum bore the brunt with $29.73 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $23.97 million, highlighting the scale of pain for leveraged shorts across majors. At the same time, the BTC liquidation heatmap suggests that if the price can close and hold above $90,000, there is a thin layer of resistance in the immediate range, with fewer liquidation clusters between $91,000 and $94,000. This opens a clean short-term path for bulls to test higher territory, particularly if spot bids continue to rise and ETF inflows stabilise. On the downside, the chart shows a heavy liquidation build-up just below $88,000, followed by more intense bands near $86,000 and $84,500. This area is also where a new CME futures gap has emerged between roughly $87,800 and $88,000, a zone many traders are now watching closely as a potential downside magnet. CME gaps have a long track record of attracting price action, and with the rally unfolding into the weekend, some expect Bitcoin to drift back toward this region before attempting any sustained move higher next week. Market participants have already flagged this risk, noting that weekend trading conditions often produce choppier price action and additional gaps that can complicate early-week structure. “Good one to keep an eye on in the week ahead,” trading account Daan Crypto Trades wrote on X, adding that with the market heading into the weekend, traders could see a few gaps and a messier chart to start the year. If Bitcoin does revisit the $88,000 area, the dense liquidation clusters below could provide short-term support as shorts are forced to cover and dip buyers step in once again. A deeper pullback toward $86,000 or even $84,500 would likely test broader market conviction, but those zones also align with strong liquidation liquidity that could help cushion downside moves. For now, the near-term outlook hinges on whether bulls can maintain pressure above $90,000. At press time, Bitcoin price was trading at $89,598, holding on to gains of roughly 2% on the day. Top altcoin gainers for the day The altcoin market cap rose 3% to nearly $1.36 trillion earlier in the day before settling at $1.34 trillion at press time. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market cap, rose 3.3% over the day, recovering back above $3,000, and was perched at $3,075 when writing. Other large-cap altcoins such as BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) saw similar gains between 2-3% respectively. Nearly all of the top 100 altcoins in terms of market capitalization were in the green. Sector-wise, the meme coin market saw some of the leading gainers of the day as the total tally of all combined went up 12% over the past 24 hours. Among them were Pepe (PEPE), outpacing the rest with gains of 32%, largely boosted by improved community sentiment after a well-followed trader who previously predicted the memecoin move to billions when it was trading at $600k, made a fresh prediction that it would go up by as much as $69 billion by the end of this year. As Pepe rallied, momentum quickly spilled over into other speculative assets, which are often backed by large cult-like followings that tend to eat into the hype. Floki (FLOKI) and SPX6900 (SPX) caught the slipstream of Pepe’s rally to post gains of over 17%, respectively. Other leading memecoins were also hovering in the green at press time.

The Yearly Dogecoin Chart On the yearly view, Cantonese Cat’s chart frames 2025 as a hold of the 0.786 log Fibonacci support at roughly $0.10879, with the market printing an inside candle into year-end. In that construction, the key takeaway is not momentum but structure: price respected a major retracement line on a log scale and stayed boxed inside the prior year’s range: “DOGE ended 2025 holding 0.786 log fib as support, forming an inside candle, favors bullish continuation,” the analyst writes. The same yearly chart also contextualizes what “continuation” on the yearly view means: the next major reference level is the 1.0 fib line up near $0.73905. That is not being presented as an imminent target, but it does underscore why analysts care about this zone, if the 0.786 level holds on higher timeframes, the chart’s mapped upside is structurally open, even if the path is not linear. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mirrors AMD’s Setup From Last Year, Analyst Claims The Monthly DOGE Chart Matt Hughes aka “The Great Mattsby’s” monthly chart tightens the focus to a single, precise level: the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.11778. Price is shown holding that line while carving out what the chart labels as a higher low, and the analyst is explicit about what that would mean in market-structure terms. “To me, this looks like the higher low needed to start the bottoming process, especially with price holding the 0.382 Fib retracement at 0.11778,” Mattsby wrote, adding that he views the “.11–.12 zone” as compelling on a risk/reward basis. In this framing, the thesis is conditional: the market is not “bullish” because it bounced, it’s constructive because it is attempting to stop making lower lows while defending a defined retracement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario If that $0.11778 level gives way on a monthly basis, the same fib ladder shown on the chart highlights lower references beneath it, including the 0.236 retracement around $0.08433. On the upside, the next retracement markers visible are $0.15428 (0.5) and $0.20210 (0.618), which would be the nearby “prove it” areas if this is, in fact, a basing process rather than a dead-cat bounce. The Weekly Dogecoin Chart Kevin (Kev_Capital_TA) shifts the emphasis to the weekly. Via X, he posted: “Still early but Dogecoin is currently printing a really nice weekly reversal demand candle within a major demand zone.” His conditions are tight and time-bound: “If you can confirm that weekly candle by Sunday close, reclaim the 4HR 200 sma/ema on both Doge and BTC then you could see the low put in for this major correctional phase and the counter trend move higher occuring. All eyes on 88K-91K on BTC.” For Dogecoin traders, the immediate calls are straightforward: Dogecoin needs to keep defending the $0.11–$0.12 area, while the weekly close either validates or negates Kevin’s reversal-candle thesis. If price loses the $0.11778 monthly retracement, the “bottoming” narrative weakens quickly; if it holds and begins reclaiming nearby resistance levels, the charts collectively argue the market may be transitioning from correction to base-building, one confirmed close at a time. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13242.

This is the worst performance for ETH since the 2018 bear market. The past year saw ETH close nine months in the red, its worst losing streak since 2018. Despite the overall positive performance of the Ethereum network, the underlying token lagged, only briefly making a new all-time high. In 2025, ETH did not suffer a big crisis, yet its performance was worse in comparison to 2022, when only seven months ended in the red. ETH crashed despite the lack of a major catastrophic event or bankruptcy in the crypto space, and in the midst of record wallet activity. While the Ethereum ecosystem showed signs of health, including address activity, stablecoin inflows , and DeFi expansion, the ETH token failed to fulfill expectations for a higher price range. ETH lagged in dollar terms despite a climb against BTC In 2025, ETH lost the faith of retail investors and instead became a playground for whales and institutions. ETH whales attempted to achieve a more favorable average price by buying the dip, but the token did not have enough momentum to break out. ETH failed to fulfill the prediction of Bitmine’s Tom Lee for a hike to $7,500 or even $10,000 at the end of the year. The token ended the year with 11.9% in market cap dominance. Over the course of 2025, ETH managed to recover from lows of 0.019 BTC to end the year at 0.034 BTC. Despite this, the token did not fulfill the expectations of expanding to $10,000. The weak ETH performance also coincided with the failure to launch a more lasting altcoin season. The weakness of L2 performance also affected Ethereum, as liquidity left even top networks like Arbitrum. Treasury companies only had a brief effect on the price of ETH. Unlike BTC treasuries, building up ETH reserves was viewed as a means to earn passive income through staking. Even DAT companies did not show conviction in the climb of ETH, but instead on the token’s DeFi and staking ecosystem. ETH recovered the $3,000 range Despite the downturn, ETH managed to recover the $3,000 range. The token mostly traded above the acquisition price of whales at $2,800, bouncing from this support level. The asset ended 2025 with a net loss of 11% after turbulent shifts each quarter. ETH ended 2025 with a net loss of close to 11%, despite the mid-year relief rally. Even with DeFi recovery, ETH had its worst year since 2018. | Source: Coingecko The token had its worst quarterly performance at the start of 2025, losing over 45%. Later, ETH managed to bounce off the mid-year slump and spend several weeks above $4,000. ETH moved to $3,079.92 as of January 2, following a market-wide recovery. The token ended 2025 with a neutral market sentiment, following weeks of relatively subdued derivative trading. Following the October 11 liquidation, ETH open interest declined to a low of $16.2B, recovering to $18B by the end of 2025. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The 35-year-old hacker thanked Trump’s First Step Act in a Friday post on X, expressing his commitment to making a positive impact in cybersecurity while looking forward to proving his doubters wrong. Thanks to President Trump's First Step Act, I have been released from prison early. I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can. To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong. — Ilya Lichtenstein (@cipherstein) January 2, 2026 The First Step Act , signed by Trump in 2018, allows prisoners to earn early release through rehabilitation programs and productive activities. From Tech Entrepreneur to Federal Criminal Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, were arrested in New York in February 2022 after authorities traced their wealth to the crypto heist. Morgan had cultivated a public persona as a successful tech businesswoman, describing herself in Forbes articles as an “economist, serial entrepreneur, software investor and rapper” while secretly helping her computer programmer husband launder the stolen fortune from Bitfinex. Both pleaded guilty to money laundering, with Morgan facing an additional conspiracy to defraud charge. Court records reveal the couple used fake identities and transferred crypto in small increments to evade detection, employing sophisticated methods to obscure the digital trail of their ill-gotten assets. Source: BBC Cooperation Secures Lighter Sentences Morgan’s attorneys successfully argued for time served in a Washington, DC federal court, citing harsh pretrial detention conditions, including surgery recovery and contracting COVID-19. She stayed free on personal recognizance, which allowed her release without bail, up until her sentencing hearing last year. Morgan received an 18-month sentence and was released in October 2024 after serving approximately eight months. Their cooperation with U.S. authorities on other crypto prosecutions reduced their potential prison time from what could have been decades behind bars for orchestrating one of the largest crypto heists in history. In a video posted to X following the conclusion of their case, Morgan said: “It’s over, and I’m very excited that I will soon be telling my story, sharing my thoughts, and telling you more about the creative and other endeavors I’ve been working on.” My statement #razzlekhan pic.twitter.com/janr9RD1Q2 — Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan (@HeatherReyhan) November 18, 2024 Trump’s Crypto Clemency Wave Draws Political Fire Lichtenstein’s release comes during a broader pattern of leniency toward crypto offenders under Trump’s administration. In March 2025, Trump pardoned BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed, and employee Greg Dwyer, all of whom pleaded guilty in 2022 to Bank Secrecy Act violations for failing to implement anti-money-laundering controls at their crypto derivatives exchange. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao received a presidential pardon in October after pleading guilty to similar violations for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at his exchange, the world’s biggest crypto platform. Trump has also expressed willingness to consider pardoning Keonne Rodriguez, CEO of privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Samourai, who was sentenced to five years for money laundering in December. During an Oval Office event on December 16, Trump told reporters: “I’ve heard about it, I’ll look at it. It sounds like, based on your question, Rodriguez. We’ll look at that, Pam,” addressing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present during the session. California Governor Gavin Newsom has intensified criticism of Trump’s pardon strategy, launching a state-backed website in December tracking what his office calls Trump’s “top criminal cronies.” California Governor Newsom slams Trump’s crypto pardons, calling @binance 's CZ and Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht “criminal cronies” in a new state tracker highlighting controversial pardons. #GavinNewsom #TrumpPardons https://t.co/j9Sac1g4Th — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 The site references Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road’s founder, sentenced to life for narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy involving over $214 million in illegal Bitcoin-facilitated drug sales, alongside newly released crime data showing continued declines across California’s major cities. This series of pardons and appeals has triggered significant political backlash, framing crypto clemency as part of a wider debate over corruption, public safety, and the expanding role of digital assets in American politics.

56738010,651787,1767375008,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Turns Negative, But History Says This Phase Could Be Significant",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharpe-ratio-turns-negative/,bitcoinist,"With Bitcoin ‘s waning price action extending and its value still below the $90,000 mark, many key metrics and indicators are starting to enter into negative territory in this new year. One of the major metrics that has turned negative as the year begins is the BTC Sharpe Ratio, which measures the risk level of the flagship cryptocurrency asset. A Rare Bitcoin Risk-Low Opportunity Has Emerged Ongoing volatility has hampered Bitcoin’s price action despite several attempts at an upward move, keeping the asset stuck below the $100,000 mark. Although the Bitcoin market appears vulnerable at first glance, a closer examination of risk-adjusted returns reveals a more complex picture. Darkfost, a market expert and author at CryptoQuant, has delved into BTC’s risk performance via the Sharpe Ratio, revealing a major shift in the market. According to Darkfost, it is a tool for evaluating risk based on the volatility and returns of an asset. By comparing these two variables, analysts are able to determine periods when exposure is more or less risky. Following his analysis of the Sharpe Ratio, the expert has disclosed that the metric has flipped into a negative territory after falling to -0.5, a move that typically unfolds during periods of market stress or transition. As seen in the chart shared by Darkfost, the metric is now approaching a historical low-risk zone. Typically, when the Sharpe ratio falls to low levels, it is accompanied by high-risk periods. However, this implies that returns have been low for Bitcoin, which is volatile by nature. In other words, investors have experienced a series of losses while volatility stays elevated. This shift may be a sign of weakness in Bitcoin market dynamics. However, it brings Bitcoin closer to areas that have historically been associated with lower downside risk and longer-term opportunities. Darkfost highlighted that the best opportunities on Bitcoin typically appear after losses have already been realized and the correction has been intensified by volatility. The trend leads to significant drawdowns and negative returns. For this reason, a negative Sharpe ratio, such as the current drop to -0.5, may indicate a favorable Bitcoin opportunity. In the past, the best purchasing opportunities have appeared whenever this ratio has reached the extremely low-risk zone indicated on the chart. Are Long-Term Holders Now Buying More BTC? A report from Axel Adler Jr., a researcher and author, shows that Bitcoin long-term holders are demonstrating resilience despite current price fluctuations. Adler’s analysis focuses on the BTC LTH Distribution Pressure metric, which has undergone a key shift that could shape the market’s trajectory. Data tells that the LTH Distribution Pressure Index has fallen to -1.628, which implies that the metric has transitioned into the Accumulation zone. The shift points to minimal selling pressure from BTC’s long-term holders, indicating renewed confidence among the cohort in the asset’s prospects. Currently, the average daily LTH spending for Bitcoin is at 221 BTC, marking one of the lowest levels in months. Darkfost also indicated the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is positioned at 1.13, confirming that BTC holders remain in profit levels. With the key metrics positioned at these critical levels, the market structure seems favorable.",Bitcoin News|Axel Adler Jr|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|LTH Distribution Pressure Index|sopr|Spent Output Profit Ratio,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

While both Bitcoin and Dogecoin remain established assets, the attention is largely centered around the accomplishment of a new player called Mutuum Finance . This initiative has recently seen its V1 lending and borrowing protocol thoroughly examined by Halborn Security. The feedback from the examination has also been incorporated, and the smart contracts have been perfected. As investors take a look at the cryptocurrencies to purchase now in light of genuine readiness and not hype, Mutuum Finance, at the current presale stage of 7, seems to slowly emerge as the best crypto. Bitcoin Remains Stable But Has Limited Potential Bitcoin is currently priced around $88,410 as it ends the year 2025 down 5% and has seen limited price action as trading volume has reduced and sellers continue to unload the asset even at a loss. The realized loss for Bitcoin currently stands at $300 million per day. Though it retains the dominant market, the immediate profit potential for Bitcoin appears to be limited. Thus, for instance, if one chooses to purchase a $5,000 Bitcoin today, it may have to perform a strong breakout to gain only a few hundred dollars. It is for this reason that investors are presently looking to other options when it comes to what to purchase for the next cycle. Dogecoin Remains Pinned By Hype Dogecoin remains very much dependent on market sentiment and trends. Although Dogecoin does make rapid movements during a bullish phase, the cryptocurrency does not have much use value and revenue-generating factors. A Dogecoin investment of $1,500 would require a significant lift in price in order for this cryptocurrency to even double in value, which has traditionally happened when viral hype catches up with a particular cryptocurrency, and not because of its fundamental factors. Mutuum Finance Audit Changes The Narrative The main reason for the rapid popularity of Mutuum Finance lies in the fact that the security review has been completed. Halborn Security has conducted a full audit of the V1 protocol, including the lending and borrowing contracts. The audit has been completed, and the recommendations have been implemented. The team is now working on the timing of the V1 launch, and Mutuum has entered the execution phase. This is an important step for those investors searching for the best cryptocurrency to buy today. Presale Growth And Pricing Mutuum Finance has managed to raise $19,550,000 since the presale began and currently has 18,650 holders. It is currently in Phase 7 at $0.04, which is up 300% from the initial phase price of $0.01. Phase 7 is selling out quickly, and this is the last opportunity to get in at $0.04. An example of the value of getting in early is shown in this scenario. Purchasing $250 worth of tokens at $0.04 will get 6,250 tokens. If demand goes up after the launch, and MUTM hits $0.20, it will be worth $1,250. However, waiting until launch at $0.06 will only buy 4166 tokens and deliver a tiny $583 profit when MUTM touches $0.20 Mutuum Finance is creating a DeFi platform that will allow users to borrow or lend their assets with much ease. The platform will have continuous activity rather than being known for one-time hype.

(NASDAQ: BMNR) today announced the release of a new Chairman’s message ( link ) outlining why shareholders are being asked to vote YES on a proposal to increase the Company’s authorized shares. The message is now available on the Bitmine website and is intended to provide additional context ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. The voting deadline is January 14, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET. In the video, Chairman Tom Lee explains the rationale behind Proposal 2, which seeks shareholder approval to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. There are three reasons the Company needs to increase authorized shares: It would allow Bitmine to conduct capital markets activities, including at-the-market offerings, convertibles, and warrants. It would provide flexibility to pursue opportunistic deals, including potential mergers or acquisitions. Most importantly, it would enable the Company to implement future stock splits as needed. Since pivoting in July to make Ethereum (ETH) its primary treasury asset, Bitmine has observed that its share price has closely tracked movements in ETH. *Coefficient (per Bloomberg) is 0.015 ETH price plus accretion of ETH/share The scatter chart in the gallery above shows the clear linkage (x-axis is ETH, y-axis is BMNR). The Company believes Ethereum represents the future of finance, a supercycle driven by Wall Street reengineering on the blockchain. Major industry leaders agree, including Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who said that tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum. Previously, Bitmine noted its view that tokenization will drive ETH/BTC to reach all-time highs (0.0873). Targeting 0.25 as Ethereum proves to be the future of finance This implies future ETH prices of: $12k $22k (prior high) $62k (0.25, “payment rails”) $250k (if BTC reaches $1mm) These potential future ETH prices can be used to calculate “implied” future BMNR prices** $22k ETH → $500 BMNR $62.5k ETH → $1,500 BMNR $250k ETH → $5,000 BMNR **These are using the coefficient 0.15* ETH plus assumed accretion ETH/share of 33%. These are for illustrative purposes only. Not a forecast. To keep shares “accessible” to the public, the Company would want to split the shares, to reset the share price back towards $25. If BMNR shares are: $500, needs 20:1 split $1,500, needs 60:1 $5,000 needs 100:1 These splits will increase total shares outstanding. Thus, Bitmine can only split shares in the future if the total authorized shares is increased.

The reversal reflects the end of end-of-year tax-loss harvesting that drove Bitcoin down 23% in Q4. Buying volume accelerated at 09:30 ET, contrasting sharply with the “4 p.m. sell-off” pattern observed throughout December. CoinGlass data show futures open interest jumped 2.16% to $130 billion in the last 24 hours, indicating renewed leverage appetite. The Floor & The Flows MicroStrategy (MSTR) likely established the local floor. The firm disclosed on Dec. 29 that it had purchased 1,229 BTC at an average price of $88,568 , defending the range ahead of the New Year. Strategy has acquired 1,229 BTC for ~$108.8 million at ~$88,568 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 23.2% YTD 2025. As of 12/28/2025, we hodl 672,497 $BTC acquired for ~$50.44 billion at ~$74,997 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD $STRE https://t.co/UGvjHj5WPg — Strategy (@Strategy) December 29, 2025 Miners are front-running the risk-on shift. Hut 8 outperformed the spot market, rallying nearly 15% to $50.73. “The crypto market opens 2026 on a balanced note, driven by renewed institutional interest, clearer regulations, faster ETF approvals by the SEC, and the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin framework, which have boosted confidence, even as most inflows remain concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, noted in an article from The Economic Times . That dynamic flipped on Friday as U.S. spot ETFs and proxies, such as Coinbase (+3%), caught a bid. Market Outlook Despite the rally, prediction markets remain cautious. Polymarket bettors currently assign only 26% odds to Bitcoin exceeding $150,000 in 2026, favoring a consolidation year. Immediate resistance sits at the Q4 2025 breakdown level of $92,500. The headline isn’t the price; it’s the timing . Throughout Q4 2025, U.S. liquidity was the exit liquidity—consistent selling during NY hours to harvest losses. Friday’s price action confirms that the “tax drag” is gone. Desks should monitor the ETH/BTC ratio ($0.034); if U.S. institutions are truly risk-on, expect rotation into high-beta alts and miner equity to outpace spot BTC in the short term.

According to market data that tracks the TOTAL3/BTC ratio — which measures all altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum against Bitcoin — the ratio finished lower for calendar years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. That streak has left traders and fund managers rethinking the old pattern where smaller tokens would often surge after Bitcoin rallies. Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash Altcoins Underperform Bitcoin Market watchers say Bitcoin’s share of the overall crypto market has grown. Bitcoin dominance was reported at roughly 59–60% during the late 2025 selloff, a level that squeezed room for other tokens. Based on reports, small-cap tokens hit their lowest point in four years as money flowed into larger, more liquid assets. Bitcoin itself slipped from an October peak and ended the year in negative territory, a development covered by major outlets that noted it was the first yearly loss for Bitcoin since 2022. Altcoins have now dropped against Bitcoin for 4 years in a row pic.twitter.com/K3rJhSh1tM — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) January 1, 2026 Widespread Losses And Heavy Market Moves Several data providers found the median performance among the top 30 altcoins was negative for the year. Market value across the crypto sector fell sharply in late 2025, with some estimates saying more than $1 trillion was erased from total market capitalization during the downturn. Traders described 2025 as a year that began with optimism but closed with broad losses, and many small tokens that rose earlier in the year gave those gains back when risk appetite faded. What Analysts Are Saying Some analysts argue that institutional flows and investor preference for liquidity were important drivers of this trend. Others point to macro pressures in the US and global markets that reduced appetite for speculative positions. Reports note that for an altcoin rebound to beat Bitcoin again, fresh capital would need to rotate specifically into smaller tokens, rather than simply following Bitcoin’s moves. That shift has not been evident so far as 2026 unfurls. The TOTAL3/BTC measure is being used by many traders to gauge altcoin strength versus Bitcoin. When that ratio falls year after year, it means a unit of Bitcoin buys more altcoin market cap than before. Market trackers used by exchanges and analytics firms flagged the persistent downward trend across the last four calendar years, which is an unusual run relative to prior cycles when altcoins sometimes outpaced Bitcoin for parts of a market cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Cautious Stance Investors are staying cautious. Volatility remains high and liquidity can dry up fast in smaller tokens, which makes large moves possible both ways. Based on reports, any meaningful restoration of altcoin gains will likely require clear, sustained capital flows and improved market sentiment. Until that happens, Bitcoin’s share of market capital will probably remain elevated, keeping pressure on smaller tokens.

The directive, delivered on Friday, gives the social media giant just 72 hours to submit an action-taken report and implement safeguards, directly threatening X’s legal immunity under Indian law and setting a precedent for AI regulation in one of the world’s largest digital markets. India’s Grok AI Order: The Compliance Ultimatum The Indian government’s order specifically targets Grok’s ability to generate content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. According to documents reviewed by Bitcoin World, the ministry has mandated that X restrict such content generation capabilities immediately. Furthermore, the platform must detail steps taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” This directive follows a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi, who highlighted instances where users prompted Grok to alter images of women to make them appear to be wearing bikinis. Concurrently, separate reports have flagged more disturbing instances where the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors. X acknowledged these lapses in safeguards earlier on Friday, stating that the problematic images had been taken down. However, investigations by Bitcoin World revealed that AI-altered images of women in bikinis remained accessible on the platform at the time of publication. The ministry’s warning carries significant weight: failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections under Section 79 of India’s Information Technology Act, which provides legal immunity from liability for user-generated content. Broader Regulatory Context and Legal Implications This specific order against X and Grok arrives just days after India’s IT ministry issued a broader advisory to all social media platforms on Monday. That advisory reminded companies that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content remains a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity. The government explicitly warned that “non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice.” Expert Analysis: The Safe Harbor Precedent Legal experts specializing in technology law note that India’s action represents a critical test case for global AI governance. “The conditional nature of safe harbor protections is being tested here,” explains Dr. Ananya Sharma, a professor of cyber law at the National Law University. “Platforms traditionally received immunity because they were intermediaries, not publishers. However, when a platform provides a tool like Grok that actively generates content, the lines blur significantly. Governments worldwide are watching how India navigates this new terrain.” Sharma further notes that any tightening of enforcement in India could create ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions, potentially forcing them to adopt the strictest regulatory standards globally. The table below outlines the key components of India’s compliance order to X: Requirement Deadline Potential Consequence Implement technical changes to restrict obscene content generation Immediate Loss of safe harbor protection Submit detailed action-taken report 72 hours from order Legal action under IT Act and criminal statutes Strengthen internal safeguards and moderation Ongoing compliance Fines and potential platform blocking The Political and Market Dynamics at Play India, with its nearly 900 million internet users, has emerged as a crucial battleground for technology regulation. The government’s assertive stance comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court. The platform argues that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even while complying with a majority of blocking directives. This creates a complex backdrop where X simultaneously contests broader regulations while facing specific, urgent demands regarding its AI product. Simultaneously, Grok’s integration into X has increased its visibility and political sensitivity. Unlike standalone AI tools, Grok is increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs part of the platform’s public discourse. This integration means that any flaws in Grok’s content filters have immediate and widespread public impact. The platform’s response to this order will be closely monitored, not just by Indian regulators, but by governments worldwide grappling with similar AI content challenges. Global Implications for AI Governance India’s action represents a significant development in the global struggle to regulate generative AI. Several key factors make this case particularly noteworthy: Market Scale: As one of the world’s largest digital markets, India’s regulatory decisions influence global corporate policies. Legal Framework Test: This case tests the applicability of existing intermediary liability laws to AI-generated content. Technical Enforcement: The order demands “technical changes,” pushing platforms toward proactive content filtering at the generation stage. Cross-Jurisdictional Impact: Compliance measures implemented for India may become de facto global standards for companies. Conclusion India’s critical Grok AI order to Elon Musk’s X platform represents a watershed moment in the regulation of generative artificial intelligence. By directly linking AI content generation to safe harbor protections, the Indian government has established a clear precedent: platforms that provide content-creation tools bear responsibility for their outputs. The 72-hour compliance deadline underscores the urgency with which regulators view these issues, particularly concerning sexually explicit and potentially unlawful material. As X navigates this compliance challenge while simultaneously contesting broader regulations in court, the outcome will undoubtedly shape not only the future of Grok in India but also the global conversation about platform liability, AI governance, and the boundaries of digital free expression in the age of generative artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What exactly did India order X to do regarding Grok? The Indian IT Ministry ordered X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to restrict Grok’s ability to generate obscene, sexually explicit, or unlawful content. The platform has 72 hours to submit a report detailing the steps taken. Q2: What are the “safe harbor” protections mentioned in the order? Under Section 79 of India’s IT Act, intermediaries (like social media platforms) enjoy legal immunity from liability for user-generated content, provided they comply with certain due diligence requirements. The order warns that non-compliance could cause X to lose this protection. Q3: What specific content triggered this government action? The action was prompted by user reports and a formal complaint from an MP regarding Grok generating AI-altered images of women in bikinis and, separately, instances of the chatbot creating sexualized images involving minors. Q4: How does this order fit into India’s broader tech regulation strategy? This is part of a consistent push by Indian regulators to ensure global tech platforms comply with local laws. It follows a broader advisory sent days earlier to all social media companies reminding them of their obligations regarding prohibited content. Q5: What happens if X does not comply within the 72-hour deadline? The government has warned of “strict legal consequences,” which could include action under India’s IT law and criminal statutes against the platform, its officers, and offending users. This could mean fines, prosecution, or even the potential loss of legal immunity for user content.

Together, the claims and charts framed a split market view, with supporters pointing to balance sheet backing while traders priced heavier risk around MSTR’s index status and recent drawdown. Saylor Linked STRC Dividend Pitch Draws Skepticism Adam Livingston said Strategy founder Michael Saylor now offers an “income vehicle” called STRC that pays an 11% cash dividend each month, and he framed the yield as a test of whether traditional finance is misreading the product’s risk. In a post on X, Livingston said critics have questioned whether an 11% monthly paid cash dividend can be legitimate. He also said skeptics have asked where the cash flow comes from, while, in his view, they still accept lower yields from government bonds despite persistent deficit spending. Livingston argued STRC differs from typical high yield products because, he said, it has balance sheet coverage that can support dividends for years, does not rely on refinancing windows to survive, and does not depend on consumer demand or economic growth to keep paying. He added that STRC is being valued like junk credit even though he claims its structure and backing do not match that profile. He also said the debate reflects a larger mismatch in how markets define safety, contrasting STRC with governments running structural deficits, companies that repeatedly roll debt, and pensions dependent on optimistic return assumptions. Saylor Links Bitcoin to MSTR’s Outsize Derivatives Bet Meanwhile, Michael Saylor said “Bitcoin makes $MSTR interesting” in a short post on X, tying Strategy’s stock story to its Bitcoin exposure rather than its legacy software business. MSTR Open Interest vs Market Cap. Source: Strategy / X A graphic shared alongside the message compared “Open Interest / Mkt Cap” across large U.S. stocks and showed MSTR far ahead of peers. The chart put MSTR at 86.2%, while Tesla followed at 22% and Meta at 10.4%. Nvidia registered 7.2% on the same measure, while Alphabet stood at 4.1% and Amazon at 4%. Apple and Microsoft appeared lowest in the group, at 3.4% and 3%, respectively. Polymarket Prices Higher Odds of MSTR MSCI Removal A market tracked by Polymarket showed a sharp rise in the perceived risk that Strategy’s stock, MSTR, could be removed from the MSCI index by March 31. As of the latest reading, the contract implied a 76% probability, up about 40 percentage points from earlier levels. The probability line climbed quickly in early December and then fluctuated between the mid-60% and mid-70% range before settling near 76% late in the month. The chart reflects shifting expectations among traders rather than an official decision by MSCI. The surge in delisting odds has coincided with a steep decline in MSTR’s share price. According to data cited alongside the chart, the stock has fallen about 66% over the past six months, dropping from roughly $457 to around $152.",News|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Price action remains choppy, reflecting a market that has yet to commit to a clear trend. After sharp swings earlier in the quarter, Bitcoin now sits in a compressed range, drawing attention to on-chain data for clues. Traders appear cautious as 2026 begins. Source: CoinCodex Is the market preparing for resolution, or is patience still required? Exchange Netflows Signal Measured Risk Bitcoin’s exchange netflow data shows persistent outflows across most sessions, indicating that more BTC continues to leave exchanges than enter them. This pattern often reflects reduced immediate selling pressure. However, the magnitude of outflows has moderated compared with earlier rally phases. Source: Cryptoquant Large spikes remain sporadic, suggesting selective positioning rather than broad accumulation. Price has responded with sideways movement rather than expansion and the signal aligns with a high-volatility range environment instead of a breakout phase. Coinbase Premium Shows Cooling U.S. Demand The Coinbase Premium Index has remained mostly negative in recent weeks, highlighting softer spot demand from U.S based investors. Periods of positive premium earlier in the year coincided with stronger price advances, yet that momentum has faded. Source: Cryptoquant The sustained discount suggests buyers hesitate to chase higher prices. While not signaling panic, the data points to restrained conviction. Without consistent premium support, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim higher resistance levels. SOPR Reflects Fragile Profit-Taking The Spent Output Profit Ratio currently hovers slightly below 1.0, indicating that coins move on-chain at breakeven levels. This reading suggests holders neither rush to realize large profits nor capitulate at losses. During strong bull phases, SOPR often sustains levels well above 1.0. That condition has not emerged. Instead, price reactions remain sensitive to small shifts in sentiment. On the side note, this behavior supports the view of a market waiting for confirmation. Scenarios Shape the 2026 Outlook Analysts outline three scenarios for Bitcoin in 2026. The highest-probability path remains a twisted range . Rate-cut expectations persist, yet economic recovery lacks strength. ETF flows appear intermittent and short-term in nature. Under this setup, Bitcoin could oscillate between $80K and $140K, with $90K to $120K forming the core zone. Concerns around Federal Reserve independence under President Donald Trump have added uncertainty to the dollar outlook. Goldman Sachs strategists have noted a dovish skew to rate forecasts as leadership changes approach at the Fed. A medium-probability scenario involves a macro shock. If recession risks intensify, deleveraging and ETF outflows could push Bitcoin below $80,000, with downside extending toward $50,000 . The lowest-probability scenario reflects a risk-on revival. Early easing, stabilized ETF inflows, and supportive liquidity could open a path toward $120,000 to $170,000. Such an outcome would require multiple favorable conditions aligning. Eyes Turn to Next Week’s Data Attention now shifts to upcoming U.S. economic data, including Nonfarm Payrolls and the unemployment rate. These releases may influence near-term dollar direction and rate expectations . Strong labor data could limit dollar weakness and cap Bitcoin’s upside. Weaker figures could reignite easing bets and volatility.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56741165,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258055,1767381911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: The Block Research Reveals Stunning Predictions for Bullish BTC, $500B Stablecoin Boom, and Prediction Market Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-2025-outlook-stablecoin-prediction-markets/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: The Block Research Reveals Stunning Predictions for Bullish BTC, $500B Stablecoin Boom, and Prediction Market Dominance NEW YORK, January 2025 – The Block Research has released its comprehensive 2025 cryptocurrency market outlook, revealing significant predictions about Bitcoin’s trajectory, stablecoin expansion, and emerging sector dominance. Analysts present a detailed examination of market forces that could shape digital asset performance throughout the coming year, combining institutional data with macroeconomic analysis. Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: ETF Inflows and Dominance Projections The Block Research analysts project Bitcoin will maintain market dominance exceeding 50% throughout 2025. This forecast relies heavily on continued net inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have fundamentally altered institutional participation since their 2024 approval. According to historical data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated approximately $50 billion in assets under management during their first year of operation. Market timing remains a crucial consideration for investors. Some analysts anticipate sideways price movement during the first half of 2025, followed by a bullish reversal in the second half. This pattern mirrors historical Bitcoin cycles where consolidation periods precede significant upward movements. However, geopolitical tensions and regulatory developments could potentially limit new all-time highs despite favorable structural conditions. Institutional Perspectives on Bitcoin Performance Financial institutions have developed increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin valuation models. The stock-to-flow model, while controversial, continues to influence market expectations. More traditional analysts examine Bitcoin through multiple lenses including: Macroeconomic correlations with inflation data and currency devaluation Network fundamentals including hash rate and active address metrics Regulatory developments across major economies and trading jurisdictions Technological advancements in layer-2 solutions and smart contract capabilities Historical data from CoinMetrics indicates Bitcoin’s 60-day correlation with traditional risk assets has decreased from 0.7 in 2022 to approximately 0.3 in late 2024. This decoupling suggests Bitcoin may be developing more independent price discovery mechanisms as institutional adoption matures. Stablecoin Sector Expansion Toward $500 Billion Threshold The stablecoin market demonstrates remarkable growth potential according to The Block Research analysis. Total stablecoin supply could surpass $500 billion during 2025, representing a substantial increase from the approximately $160 billion circulating at the end of 2024. This expansion correlates directly with several key adoption drivers. Corporate payment integration represents the most significant growth vector. Major payment processors including PayPal and Stripe have expanded stablecoin support throughout 2024. Cross-border settlement efficiency provides compelling cost savings compared to traditional correspondent banking networks. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) reported in late 2024 that blockchain-based settlements reduced average transaction times from 3-5 days to under 24 hours. Stablecoin Market Share Projections 2025 Stablecoin 2024 Market Share 2025 Projected Share Primary Use Case USDT (Tether) 68% 55-60% Exchange trading pairs USDC (Circle) 22% 30-35% Corporate payments & bridging DAI (MakerDAO) 5% 7-9% DeFi collateral Other Stablecoins 5% 4-6% Niche applications Market share redistribution represents another critical trend. USDT’s dominance may decline as USDC emerges as a preferred neutral bridging asset. Regulatory clarity from the United States Treasury Department regarding stablecoin issuance has accelerated institutional adoption of compliant alternatives. European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, fully implemented in December 2024, establish additional compliance requirements favoring transparent stablecoin operators. Prediction Markets Emerge as Dominant Narrative Prediction markets represent one of 2025’s strongest cryptocurrency narratives according to The Block Research. These decentralized platforms enable users to speculate on real-world events using blockchain-based contracts. Growth drivers include increasing geopolitical uncertainty, election cycles in major economies, and technological maturation of oracle networks. Platforms like Polymarket and Augur have demonstrated substantial volume growth throughout 2024. The U.S. presidential election generated over $200 million in prediction market volume across decentralized platforms. This represents a 400% increase compared to the 2020 election cycle according to Dune Analytics data. Market structure improvements including lower fees and enhanced liquidity mechanisms should accelerate adoption throughout 2025. Complementary Sector Growth: Perp DEXs and RWAs Perpetual decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) continue gaining market share against centralized counterparts. dYdX, GMX, and Gains Network collectively processed over $500 billion in volume during 2024. These platforms offer non-custodial trading with leverage up to 100x in some cases. Regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges throughout 2024 has accelerated migration toward decentralized alternatives. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization represents another growth sector. Financial institutions including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have launched blockchain-based tokenization platforms. These enable fractional ownership of traditionally illiquid assets including real estate, private equity, and fine art. The total value of tokenized RWAs exceeded $15 billion by December 2024 according to RWA.xyz data. Market Risks and Potential Headwinds The Block Research identifies several potential headwinds that could impact 2025 cryptocurrency performance. Corporate treasury selling represents a significant concern. Companies holding substantial digital asset reserves may implement profit-taking strategies. Bitmain, the cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturer, reportedly holds approximately 50,000 ETH worth roughly $200 million at current prices. Analysts suggest the company may begin selling these holdings during the first quarter of 2025. Venture capital valuations present additional concerns. Private market cryptocurrency company valuations reached unprecedented levels during the 2021-2022 bull market. Many of these investments face dilution or down rounds as companies require additional funding. Token unlock schedules exacerbate selling pressure. Approximately $50 billion worth of previously locked tokens will become liquid throughout 2025 according to TokenUnlocks.app data. Altcoin performance may demonstrate sustained weakness according to analyst consensus. Only projects with verifiable real-world use cases and sustainable tokenomics will likely maintain valuation. The altcoin market capitalization relative to Bitcoin has declined throughout 2024, continuing a trend that began in early 2022. This suggests capital rotation toward established assets with clearer regulatory pathways. Conclusion The Block Research 2025 cryptocurrency outlook presents a nuanced perspective on market development. Bitcoin dominance appears sustainable given institutional adoption through ETF vehicles. Stablecoin expansion toward $500 billion reflects broader financial system integration. Prediction markets emerge as a dominant narrative alongside complementary sectors including perp DEXs and RWA tokenization. However, investors must remain cognizant of potential headwinds including corporate selling and token unlock schedules. The Bitcoin 2025 outlook ultimately depends on macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and technological innovation across the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason The Block Research expects Bitcoin to maintain over 50% market dominance? A1: Analysts cite continued net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as the primary driver. Institutional adoption through these regulated vehicles provides sustained buying pressure that supports Bitcoin’s market position relative to altcoins. Q2: How could stablecoin supply realistically reach $500 billion in 2025? A2: Corporate payment integration represents the largest growth vector. As more businesses adopt stablecoins for cross-border settlements and supply chain payments, demand for dollar-pegged digital assets increases substantially beyond current trading-focused usage. Q3: Why are prediction markets considered a strong narrative for 2025? A3: Prediction markets benefit from multiple catalysts including global election cycles, geopolitical uncertainty, and technological maturation. These platforms offer transparent event resolution that traditional betting markets cannot match, creating unique utility. Q4: What risks could limit Bitcoin’s potential for new all-time highs? A4: Geopolitical tensions, regulatory crackdowns in major economies, and macroeconomic factors like sustained high interest rates could suppress price appreciation. Additionally, large-scale token unlocks and corporate treasury selling create technical selling pressure. Q5: Why might USDC gain market share against USDT in 2025? A5: USDC benefits from regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions and its perception as a more compliant, transparent stablecoin. As institutional adoption increases, particularly for corporate payments, entities prefer assets with clearer regulatory standing and auditing practices.

He once called it “a feature, not a bug” while pitching Strategy as the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin holder in the public market. That pitch is about to meet its biggest test yet, as the company prepares to report a multibillion‑dollar loss for Q4 after Bitcoin saw a 24% crash. The expected hit marks a sharp reversal from the prior quarter, when Strategy booked a $2.8 billion profit. This time, the numbers move the other way. The loss is tied to an unrealized markdown on the company’s roughly $60 billion Bitcoin stash, whose value dropped fast as crypto prices fell late in the year. The swing is large, and investors are already bracing for it. Strategy’s accounting change exposes the full effect of Bitcoin’s drop Cryptopolitan previously reported that Strategy changed how it logged its crypto holdings in Q1 2024 when the company began valuing its Bitcoin at current market prices, rather than keeping it at cost. That naturally makes earnings far more sensitive to price moves, especially during sharp selloffs like the one seen in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin fell 24% over that period. That single move explains why the coming loss looks so heavy. Aaron Jacob, an associate professor at Brigham Young University and a senior adviser at Taxbit, put it plainly. “There was this one-time pop, but that is a different story in this quarter,” Jacob said. “It is going to be a sizable loss.” The timing matters. Strategy, once known as MicroStrategy, reinvented itself years ago as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy. That approach paid off for a while. The stock beat major indexes after the shift. But sentiment turned in 2025. The shares fell 48% during the year, signaling growing doubts about the treasury‑heavy model Saylor built more than five years ago. Falling equity prices also raised practical concerns. Bitcoin produces no income. The company’s software unit brings in limited positive cash flow. Investors began to question how Strategy would cover future costs like dividends and interest payments without selling Bitcoin. To ease that pressure, the company raised cash on Dec. 1 by selling common shares and building a reserve. Strategy juggles guidance, balance sheet pressure, and fading premium At the start of last month, Strategy updated its full‑year outlook using a Bitcoin price range of $85,000 to $110,000 by year‑end. Based on that range, the company projected operating income anywhere from a $7 billion loss to a $9.5 billion profit. Bitcoin finished the year down 6.5%, closing at $87,648, pushing expectations closer to the lower end of that range. Saylor’s crypto movement is no longer unique, as you should know, because in 2024, many public companies copied the Strategy playbook to attract investors seeking stock‑based crypto exposure. Some surged early, then sank as prices rolled over. Tommy Lee‑backed BitMine Immersion Technologies followed that path and now faces the same fair‑value accounting rules. Bitcoin’s crash also hit Saylor personally, as his net worth fell about 40% in 2025 to roughly $3.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Another pressure point is Strategy’s enterprise value, which includes debt and perpetual preferred stock, stood at $61 billion, which is close to the value of its Bitcoin holdings and risks slipping below it for the first time in more than two years. The stock has dropped by nearly 70% from its November 2024 peak, dragging the company’s mNAV to just above 1 and wiping out most of the premium investors once paid for Strategy exposure. But on the first trading day of 2026, Strategy stock has surged by 5.2% as of press time to around $160, while Bitcoin has rallied 2.6% to $90,549.

With market cap holding around 1.79 tn and 24-hour trading volume jumping above 44 bn, momentum is quietly rebuilding even as broader sentiment remains cautious. The world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to lead the market, accounting for a large share of the total crypto market cap of roughly 3.06 tn. Circulating supply is now just under 20 mn BTC, leaving limited room before the 21 mn hard cap—an ongoing structural factor supporting long-term valuation. Why Bitcoin Is Rising Today Bitcoin’s latest move higher isn’t driven by hype. Instead, it reflects improving market participation and steady accumulation. Trading volume has surged more than 120% day on day, a sign that buyers are stepping in with conviction rather than chasing short-term moves. At the same time, the Fear and Greed Index remains in “fear” territory near 34, suggesting positioning is still cautious. Historically, that combination—rising price with restrained sentiment—often supports sustained trends rather than blow-off rallies. Altcoin participation remains selective, with the Altcoin Season Index near 24, firmly keeping the market in Bitcoin-led mode. Bitcoin Price Price Prediction: Triangle Breakout to Drive Bullish Price Action Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC is trading near $89,900 on the 2-hour chart, and the structure looks increasingly constructive. Price has been compressing inside a symmetrical triangle, defined by lower highs from the $93,500 area and a rising base formed between $85,800 and $87,000. This pattern reflects balance and declining volatility, not weakness. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The broader trend remains intact. Bitcoin continues to post higher lows, supported by an ascending trendline from mid-December. Price is holding above the 50-EMA and 100-EMA cluster near $88,500–$89,000, where both averages have flattened and started to curl higher. This type of EMA compression often precedes directional expansion when paired with structural support. Candlestick behavior supports that view. Recent pullbacks have produced small-bodied candles with limited lower wicks, showing dips are being absorbed rather than sold. There’s no evidence of distribution patterns or aggressive bearish follow-through. RSI has pushed into the high-60s, breaking above its prior range and signaling building upside pressure without reaching stretched conditions. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Key Levels and Forward View From a projection standpoint, a confirmed close above triangle resistance near $90,500–$90,900 would likely trigger a measured move toward $93,500, followed by the $96,000 region if momentum accelerates. On the downside, the structure weakens only on sustained acceptance below 87,000, which would expose the 85,800 support zone. From a forward-looking lens, this setup resembles consolidation before continuation rather than exhaustion. Acceptance above 90,500 would favor a move toward 95,000 and beyond, reinforcing optimism around the next phase of the crypto cycle as liquidity gradually returns. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Julia Goodwin learned this twice. First, she and her husband Glenn were asleep in their Delray Beach home when tapping at the sliding glass door pulled them into the living room. They thought it was a bird. The light flipped on. The noise stopped. Then the glass exploded. All of a sudden, there were guns pressed into her head and neck while demands came fast for her phone, laptop, and wallet access. Since 2020, more than 215 physical crypto attacks have been recorded worldwide, with 2025 nearly doubling the prior year. Security tracker Jameson Lopp has said the real number is higher because many victims stay silent. According to Bloomberg, the organizer of these crimes is a dude named Jarod Seemungal, better known as Meow, who was a genius at 14, basically living online, coding for games, and getting paid in Bitcoin. But Jarod was robbed himself at gunpoint months later and decided to hire muscle. The Goodwin attack was meant to grab at least $200,000, believed to sit on Gemini. Three days later, the crew abducted a 20-year-old hacker, forced him to open empty Coinbase accounts, beat him, sent ransom videos, and then dumped him near I-95. In Texas, associates burned a man with a hot iron and jammed utensils under his mother’s fingernails. He fled while they searched the yard for a hardware wallet. In another miss, Remy broke into an empty Airbnb wearing a delivery uniform, according to Bloomberg. In July, as the goons staked out a retired New York firefighter believed to hold $200,000 across Coinbase and a Ledger device, the FBI moved. Agents arrested Remy at a turnpike McDonald’s. In his trunk sat zip ties and an AK-style rifle. Sentencing was severe, though. Remy received 47 years for kidnapping conspiracy and wire fraud. Matt, a lookout who earned only $4,000 in seven months, got 12 years. Jarod is due for release in 2040. US largest exchange limits protection as physical crypto attacks rise Meanwhile, Coinbase (the largest crypto exchange in America) says its platform insurance mainly covers server breaches, not coercion. Allegedly , in one instance, machine-learning systems flagged irregular activity and stopped the final $9,145 transfer, not the prior $156,853. Coinbase says it balances stopping bad actors with customer access. Julia still believes in crypto and blockchain, even after two attacks. Travel costs more now. Glenn’s health worsens. She told Jarod in court, “You’ve squandered everything that I worked so hard for.” Meanwhile, Russian hackers are still draining crypto wallets linked to the massive LastPass breach in 2022, according to analysis from TRM Labs. Back then, LastPass had admitted that attackers got into its systems by hacking a developer account. They stole parts of the company’s source code and technical tools. Later, the same hackers hit GoTo, the cloud provider where LastPass had stored encrypted vault backups. Those vaults held not just passwords, but in many cases, crypto wallet seed phrases and private keys. “Depending on the length and complexity of your master password and iteration count setting, you may want to reset your master password,” warned LastPass.

The unlock arrived at a sensitive moment for price action, coming just after XRP closed December 2025 in the red. Large escrow releases often lead to concerns about sell pressure , but early on-chain activity suggests the usual Ripple pattern is already unfolding, with a significant portion of the unlocked supply being prepared for relocking. How The 1 Billion XRP Escrow Release Unfolded Blockchain data shows the release occurred in three major transactions, all settled within a narrow time window on January 1. Immediately the year started, 300 million XRP, valued at about $552 million, was unlocked and sent to the address rMhkqz, identified as the Ripple (28) wallet. Shortly after, another 200 million XRP, worth about $368 million, followed into the same wallet, bringing Ripple (28)’s intake to half a billion XRP within seconds. The final and largest portion arrived into a third wallet during which 500 million XRP, valued at approximately $920 million, was released to the r9NpyV address, designated as the Ripple (9) wallet. Together, these transactions completed the scheduled 1 billion XRP escrow release, immediately increasing the circulating supply on paper. The timing of the escrow release adds complexity to XRP’s near-term outlook. XRP ended December 2025 with a red monthly close of negative 14.8%. Notably, this was the first time XRP closed December in the red since 2022. An influx of unlocked tokens during such a period can increase bearish sentiment, particularly among short-term traders sensitive to supply changes. Relocking Activity As Ripple Repeats Its Playbook History shows Ripple always relocks between 70% and 80% of each monthly escrow release, a practice that has helped soften long-term supply shocks. Interestingly, activity after the unlocks indicates this approach was repeated within 24 hours of the unlocks. Transaction records from XRPScan reveal that funds exiting the Ripple (9) wallet were quickly routed toward new escrow arrangements, and a substantial share of the newly released supply was removed from immediate circulation. Millions of tokens were sent out from both Ripple (9) and Ripple (28) simultaneously. At 17:17 UTC, an escrow creation transaction locked 500 million XRP into the Ripple (15) address, followed by another escrow creation at 17:21 UTC that secured an additional 100 million XRP in the same wallet. Related Reading: Ripple’s XRP Ledger Just Did Something Bitcoin Has Never Done Parallel activity was also observed from Ripple (14), where a separate escrow creation locked 100 million XRP at 17:19 UTC. Combined, these transactions accounted for 700 million XRP already placed back into escrow. The appearance of escrow creation transactions changes the narrative of a supply dump. Instead of a full-scale sell-off, the data points to controlled relocking consistent with Ripple’s strategy of escrow management. XRP’s price response will likely depend less on the headline escrow release itself and more on how much of the remaining unlocked supply reaches crypto exchanges.",Ripple|blockchain|escrow|ripple|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In early trading on January 2, Strategy shares rose modestly, offering brief relief after months of pressure. Even with the bounce, the stock remains down roughly 66% from its July peak. The company’s mNAV, a measure comparing its market valuation to the value of its Bitcoin holdings, stood near 1.02, leaving little margin before slipping below 1.0. A move beneath that level would mean the market is valuing Strategy at less than the Bitcoin it owns. Why Strategy’s Bitcoin Discount Is Raising Red Flags The distinction matters because Strategy’s equity appeal has long rested on trading at a premium to its Bitcoin reserves. When mNAV falls below 1.0, investors can theoretically buy Bitcoin more cheaply by purchasing the asset directly rather than holding a stock that represents it. Historically, such conditions have triggered selling pressure, as the rationale for paying corporate risk, dilution, and management costs weakens. The company’s balance sheet reflects the tension. Strategy holds 672,497 bitcoin, the largest corporate stash in the world, accumulated since August 2020 at an average cost of about $75,000 per coin. With Bitcoin trading around $90,000, those holdings are worth roughly $60.7 billion, leaving the company with an unrealized gain of about 20%. Despite that, Strategy’s basic market capitalization sits closer to $45 billion, and its diluted valuation is around $50 billion, already implying a discount to the underlying assets. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries On an enterprise value basis, which accounts for debt and cash, Strategy’s mNAV is estimated just under 1.0. That proximity has sharpened scrutiny because the company relies on issuing equity at a premium to fund further Bitcoin purchases. If the stock trades persistently below the value of its reserves, raising capital through share sales becomes more difficult and potentially dilutive. Management has taken steps to reduce near-term funding risk. In recent weeks, Strategy raised $747.8 million through stock sales under its ATM program. Billionaire Michael Saylor’s Strategy boosts USD reserves by $748M to $2.19B via its ATM program, while holding 671,268 BTC unchanged. #BTC #Bitcoin https://t.co/gOqBzbzzXy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 The company says the reserve now covers roughly 21 months of dividend and interest obligations, easing pressure to liquidate Bitcoin during periods of market stress. Executives have described selling Bitcoin as a last resort , to be considered only if other financing options close and the firm’s valuation falls below its asset base. Bitcoin Premium Shrinks as Strategy Stock Struggles Still, another threshold looms below the mNAV line. If Bitcoin were to fall under Strategy’s average acquisition price near $74,000, the company’s holdings would drop below cost, potentially testing investor confidence. While some shareholders view such scenarios as long-term buying opportunities, they can also amplify volatility among traders less committed to the strategy. The stock’s recent performance reflects that uncertainty, with Strategy shares having fallen more than 60% over the past six months and ending 2025 down nearly 50%, making it the worst performer in the Nasdaq-100 last year. Source: Google Finance The decline followed a sharp rally earlier in 2025, when the stock surged alongside Bitcoin before reversing as risk sentiment shifted in the second half. Bitcoin itself remains elevated, trading about 28% below its all-time high but up sharply in recent sessions on rising volume. That divergence between Bitcoin’s resilience and Strategy’s equity weakness has fueled debate over whether the company now resembles an investment vehicle rather than an operating business. Critics, including economist Peter Schiff, have pointed to the stock’s drawdown as evidence that aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has weighed on shareholders.

That sharp month-to-month decline was driven by fewer large-scale heists, but the damage that did occur was still significant. Reports have disclosed a mix of scams and technical failures that together made December anything but risk-free. December Losses Fall 60% PeckShield tracked roughly 26 major exploits during the month. The largest single hit was an address poisoning scam that took about $50 million. In that scheme, victims were tricked into sending funds to an address that looked almost identical to a legitimate one. Other large losses included a $27 million drain from a multi-signature wallet tied to a private key leak, about $7 million tied to a Trust Wallet exploit, and roughly $3.9 million linked to issues involving the Flow protocol. These figures were reported across multiple outlets and match the totals PeckShield compiled. #PeckShieldAlert December 2025 witnessed ~26 major crypto exploits, resulting in total losses of ~$76M. This figure represents a decrease of over 60% from November’s total of $194.27M, marking a significant reduction in monthly losses. Notably: Wallet 0xcB80…819 lost $50M… pic.twitter.com/CNW3R6646j — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) January 1, 2026 Major Scams Still Cause Big Damage Address poisoning stood out because it relies on human error rather than a broken protocol. A small mistake — copying the wrong address — could wipe out a large transfer. Trust Wallet’s loss was linked to a browser extension weakness that allowed attackers to move funds. In some cases, reimbursements were being discussed by affected services. Reports have disclosed that private key exposure, even in wallets meant to be secure, continues to be a common root cause of big losses. Some experts say the fall in dollar losses reflects fewer massive breaches, not a vanishing of threats. Security teams have been more active, and some wallets tightened checks. But the methods used by attackers did not disappear. Scams that prey on mistakes, like the address trick, are still in play, and sophisticated intrusions remain possible. It was observed that a handful of incidents accounted for the bulk of December’s total, which helps explain the large swing in monthly totals. Close monitoring into these trends by regulators and other stakeholders like platform operators will continue as well. There have been growing pressures to provide better protections for exchanges and other wallets when there has been a breach; and for more timely actions after the compromise has been identified.

His exit from federal custody was made possible through the First Step Act, a prison reform law signed by Donald Trump during his first term in office. The news broke Thursday night after Ilya posted the announcement himself on X, saying, “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.” Ilya had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years behind bars. That came after he pleaded guilty to helping move billions of dollars in stolen crypto and confessed to the Bitfinex hack, which at current market prices totals more than $4 billion. His prison term factored in time already served after his 2022 arrest, giving him credit that slashed down his time inside. Trump’s First Step Act reduces sentences and puts crypto offenders on home confinement The First Step Act, passed in December 2018, was introduced as a bipartisan attempt to reduce the size of the U.S. federal prison system. It allowed inmates to earn early release or home confinement if they met certain behavior requirements and were deemed low risk under a federal assessment system. Ilya appears to have qualified, and as of Friday morning, a federal inmate search showed him set for official release on February 9. According to CNBC, a Trump administration official confirmed that Ilya “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” Heather Morgan, Ilya’s wife, also confirmed his early return in her own X post, two minutes after his, writing that,“The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart,” and attached a photo of them smiling together. The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart. 💜🙏🪬 https://t.co/toUJ0Bz70h pic.twitter.com/plsnktmJ5l — Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan (@HeatherReyhan) January 2, 2026 Heather had pleaded guilty alongside Ilya in the same case for helping launder the stolen funds and was sentenced to 18 months in February 2025, only to announce her early release in October. In a video posted on October 26, Heather appeared in a bathtub wearing just a towel and addressed her followers: “Why hello Razzlers, I have missed you,” using her rap alias, Razzlekhan. She ended with a nod to Trump: “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter.” The timing of his release lines up with the White House’s expanded use of the law in 2025 under Trump’s second term. On his first day back in office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who had been serving a life sentence. Then, in October, he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, the founder of Binance. CZ had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.

Below is a breakdown of Qwen3-MAX’s two-sided forecasts, covering both bullish upside targets and bearish downside risks for each asset as 2026 gets underway. Ripple (XRP): Alibaba AI Predicts Rally Toward $5 by Year-End Under its bearish scenario, Alibaba’s AI projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could slide from its current price near $1.90 to roughly $1.50 and stay in that range as a worst-case outcome. You can already hear the loudest “I would take it” from XRP holders if that is truly the worst-case scenario. Source: Ailbaba AI Prediction On the optimistic side, Alibaba’s model envisions a powerful breakout, with XRP potentially jumping 82% to reach $3.50 or even $5 before the end of the year, nearly two times its previous all-time high. The launch of U.S.-listed spot XRP ETFs could act as a catalyst for fresh institutional inflows during the new year, mirroring early demand patterns seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Solana (SOL): Alibaba AI Forecasts a 400% Upside Move Alibaba AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 is to target $300 to $400 price range. That is almost 400% from the current price. Solana still looks like the coin of the cycle. Alibaba’s AI outlook points to Solana’s unmatched speed, booming DeFi activity, and growing institutional interest as the main drivers. With all of that happening while price continues to hold above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for a big move heading into 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. If it fails to rally, Alibaba AI predicts the price could drop below the $100 mark in the bearish scenario. Bitcoin (BTC): Alibaba AI Says Bitcoin Could Surge Past $150K After closing 2025 in the red and breaking the classic four-year cycle, Alibaba’s AI expects Bitcoin to come back swinging and push past $150K by the end of the year. The call is driven by accelerating spot ETF inflows and macro conditions that favor hard assets. In a stronger scenario, the model even sees Bitcoin peaking around $175K. Bitcoin is heading into 2026 at a pretty critical point. Price is getting squeezed, RSI is starting to curl up, and institutions keep stacking, even though prediction markets are not convinced a fast six-figure breakout is coming. On Polymarket, $120,000 is still seen as the most likely outcome, while BTC continues to coil inside a tight range around $89,000. Whatever move comes next is likely going to set the mood for the rest of the year. If Bitcoin can get a clean close above $90,500, that would break the triangle to the upside and likely send the price toward $92,800 first, then $95,000. A break below $87,000 would hurt the setup and open the door to a move down toward $85,800. For now, though, the structure still slightly favors the upside. Maxi Doge Is Built For Moments Like This When the market is having violent swings, uncertainty, and two-sided chaos across majors like XRP and Solana. History shows one thing clearly: memecoins thrive when conviction disappears. This is where Maxi Doge stands out. Maxi Doge is not trying to compete with Layer 1 narratives, ETF headlines, or institutional timelines. It exists for pure momentum, community-driven upside. It also reflexive moves when traders rotate out of crowded trades and into asymmetric bets. Every cycle, when majors stall or chop, capital looks for something louder, faster, and unapologetically speculative. That is exactly where Doge-style assets explode, and Maxi Doge is positioned as a high-beta expression of that rotation. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 71% APY through staking rewards. No promises of revolution. No overengineered roadmap. Just liquidity, attention, and crowd psychology. If 2026 starts with volatility, indecision, and sharp rotations, Maxi Doge is designed for that environment, not despite it.

Right now, XRP, Solana, and PEPE are standing out as some of the more interesting picks to watch as potential best crypto to buy. Even with Bitcoin bouncing back toward $89.5K, most altcoins are still down more than 50% from their all-time highs. Bitcoin has pretty much broken the classic four-year cycle narrative, so nobody can say with confidence what comes next. Still, when you look at fundamentals, SOL, XRP, and PEPE remain some of the most compelling names going into the new year, and here is why. Ripple (XRP) Could Head To $8 In 2026: Bank Analyst Predicts XRP just hit an eight-year low in exchange supply, which usually points to accumulation happening while price sits near lows. A big part of that is coming from ETFs, which have already pulled in over $1.4B since launch. That is close to 0.75% of the total XRP supply in just a couple of months. On top of that, analysts at Standard Chartered think XRP could rip more than 300% and push past $8 in 2026, fueled by spot ETF demand and the regulatory clarity XRP finally has.. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Solana (SOL) is The Top Chain In 2025 And Could Do It Again In 2026 Solana is not an emerging chain anymore. It closed 2025 as the top blockchain by revenue, bringing in over $1.4B and even beating Hyperliquid, which came in second. It also led all chains in DEX volume and ranked second only to Binance Smart Chain in active addresses back in November, and that was during one of the weakest periods for the network. Source: Cryptorank Another big milestone that cannot be overlooked is the approval of Solana ETFs. These are expected to bring fresh demand into the ecosystem, similar to the launch period when SOL logged 21 straight days of inflows. With all of this happening while price is still holding above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for an explosive move in 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. PEPE Could Do It Again And Start Memecoin Season PEPE is already up nearly 50% since the start of 2026. Last bear market, PEPE came out of nowhere and was one of the sparks that helped kick off the bull run. It basically created the memecoin season everyone still remembers. With the way it is moving now, a lot of people are starting to think it could pull that off again and bring memecoins back to life. That candle just smashed through a resistance that held for months around $0.000005, but there is still a long road ahead. After this push, RSI is sitting around 89, which is clearly overbought, not oversold. That means a pullback would be normal here. If PEPE manages to flip that old resistance into support on a dip, it could be setting up for a very strong year. It could end up recreating the same kind of rally it pulled off earlier in 2025. If that happens, the coin below stands out as one of the strongest candidates to follow that move. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Be The Next Coin To Follow This Move While large caps like XRP and Solana grind through key levels, early-stage capital is already rotating into higher-upside plays. One project pulling attention right now is Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2 focused on speed, scalability, and real utility. Something many investors feel Bitcoin itself lacks today. The project has already crossed the $30M raised milestone. This is notable given the current market environment and risk-off sentiment across altcoins. What stands out is timing. Bitcoin Hyper is gaining traction. While most speculative assets are still deeply discounted, the same setup that historically produced outsized returns once momentum returned. If 2026 turns into a broader risk-on year, Bitcoin Hyper sits in a strong position to benefit from that rotation. As always, high-upside plays come with higher risk. But for traders looking beyond large caps, Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up as one of the more watched narratives going into the year.

This surge in accumulation could be a strong signal, raising the odds of a bullish XRP price prediction in the near term. January has often been a favorable month for altcoins. Data from CoinGlass shows that Ethereum (ETH) , the top altcoin, has closed the month with gains in 5 of the past 9 years, hinting at a possible repeat performance across the market. Deep-pocketed participants may be positioning their portfolios to benefit from this trend if history repeats. According to data from Santiment, whales holding over 1 billion tokens added $3.6 billion worth of XRP between December 31 and January, pushing the total of XRP they own to 27.47 billion tokens. Although smaller whales have been progressively dumping the asset, bigger ones are accumulating, signaling a strong shift in sentiment. XRP Price Prediction: Crossing $1.90 Could Set the Stage for an Explosive Move Upwards XRP has increased by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. Trading volumes are still relatively low, accounting for just 1.5% of the token’s circulating market cap. Source: TradingView The $1.90 level is the key resistance to watch as a move above would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure. Such a trend reversal could mark the beginning of a strong move to $3. Since seasonality favors a bullish outlook, this could be a strong month for XRP from a statistical standpoint. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index has just flipped bullish by moving above its 14-day average, a signal that often marks the start of broader altcoin recoveries. If that momentum carries through, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could move first, especially as it brings Solana’s speed and low costs to Bitcoin’s secure network, while the window to get in early is still open. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $30M as Investors Bet on the Future of a Scalable Bitcoin The Bitcoin network has long struggled to grow beyond simple transactions, limited by slow speeds and high costs. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is breaking that barrier, raising over $30 million to build the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, one that can handle thousands of transactions at lightning speed and minimal cost. Powered by Solana’s high-performance tech, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers launch advanced dApps directly connected to Bitcoin, without forcing users to move their assets off the original chain. It’s a massive leap for Bitcoin utility, and investors are rushing in before it goes live. The Hyper Bridge is designed to receive BTC tokens in a designated Bitcoin wallet and mint the corresponding amount in the Hyper L2 almost instantly. Once in there, investors can earn yield, stake, and lend their assets. They will also get access to a growing list of DeFi apps, payment platforms, and even meme coin launchpads. The demand for $HYPER, the protocol’s native asset, should skyrocket as adoption accelerates. To buy $HYPER and seize this opportunity, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL for this token or use a bank card to invest in seconds.

SOL remains capped below stacked EMAs, with the 50-day near $136 as key resistance. Spot flows show early stabilization, but conviction remains limited. By Parshwa Turakhiya Solana (SOL-USD) is starting the new year locked in an uneasy balance, trading near the $127 to $128 area on Friday after months of steady compression. Price is no longer in free fall, but it has not reclaimed trend control either What is driving the tape is hesitation rather than fear. Selling pressure that dominated November and December has largely burned off, yet buyers remain selective, stepping in on dips instead of chasing upside. That dynamic explains why the opening sessions of 2026 have been defined by sideways trade rather than a sharp rebound. The tone feels defensive but calmer. Volatility has compressed, intraday swings have narrowed, and price has gravitated toward equilibrium. This is the market pausing to reassess after a difficult second half of 2025, not one bracing for immediate capitulation. The tension heading into January is clear. Sellers no longer appear urgent, but buyers are not confident enough to force a breakout. Until one side gains conviction, Solana is likely to remain range-bound, with rallies sold and dips bought selectively rather than aggressively. Daily structure remains defensive despite stabilization On the daily chart, the broader structure still leans bearish. Solana remains below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, which are stacked bearishly from roughly $126 through the mid-$160s. The 20-day EMA has flattened near the current price, a sign that downside momentum has slowed. However, the 50-day near $136 and the 100-day around $152 continue to represent heavy overhead supply. Until price can reclaim at least the 50-day on a closing basis, upside attempts are likely to be treated as corrective rather than the start of a new trend. SOL price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum confirms that assessment. The daily RSI is hovering just below 50, reflecting balance rather than strength. Strong reversals typically require RSI to push decisively back above the mid-50s. Solana has not done that yet. The market has neutralized oversold conditions, but it has not flipped into accumulation mode. Short-term structure offers a more constructive, though still cautious, view. On the 30-minute chart, Solana has reclaimed short-term trend support, with Supertrend flipping positive and price holding above SAR dots near $126. This favors dip-buying over selling rallies, but the advances have been choppy and incremental. Each push toward $128-$129 has met supply, suggesting short-term traders are fading range edges rather than positioning for continuation. As long as the price holds above the $125-$126 zone, near-term bias remains mildly constructive. A clean loss of that area would likely invite another sweep toward $122. Flows and positioning hint at stabilization, not conviction On-chain flow data adds important context. Spot netflows have been largely negative for months, reflecting steady distribution during the second half of 2025. That trend has recently eased. The latest readings show modest net inflows of around $3M as price stabilizes near $127. This is not aggressive accumulation, but it does suggest forced selling pressure has cooled. Historically, Solana has required sustained positive inflows to support durable rallies. For now, the data points to stabilization rather than a shift in behavior. Derivatives positioning tells a similar story. Futures open interest has ticked higher even as price moved sideways, sitting near $7.5B. That combination often signals traders rebuilding exposure after a washout, but it also raises the risk of volatility if price breaks out of its range. Long-short ratios show retail accounts leaning modestly long, while top traders remain heavily skewed long by account count. That divergence implies professional traders are positioning for upside, but cautiously, likely hedged and size-managed. Recent liquidation data supports that view, with shorts absorbing most losses during minor rallies while long liquidations remain contained. From a bullish perspective, the roadmap is defined but demanding. Solana needs to hold above $125 and reclaim $130 with authority. A daily close above the $136–$138 zone, aligned with the 50-day EMA, would be the first meaningful signal that trend control is shifting. If that occurs alongside improving spot inflows and expanding volume, a move toward $150 becomes plausible, reframing Solana as a recovery trade rather than a laggard. The bearish scenario remains straightforward. Failure to defend $125 would expose the lower end of the recent range near $122. A breakdown there risks reopening the path toward the psychological $110 level, especially if broader crypto sentiment weakens or Bitcoin rolls over. With the 200-day EMA still far overhead, macro shocks could quickly turn this quiet consolidation into another leg lower. Previously, we noted that Solana’s late-2025 declines were marked by persistent distribution and repeated failures at key moving averages. While selling pressure has eased, that structural backdrop has not yet changed. Confirmation is still missing. For now, Solana is no longer collapsing, but it is not trending either. Until price reclaims higher-time-frame resistance and spot flows turn decisively constructive, this remains a market defined by patience rather than momentum.

SOL is now up by 4% in a week, although it does remain down by 9.5% in a month and by 38% in the past year. These percentages may be disappointing, but there are strong reasons to believe that the Solana price is on the brink of a strong and sustained recovery. Not only do its fundamentals remain as strong as ever, but high-profile investors are also tipping the coin for big things, with Skybridge Capital founder and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci picking Solana as one of his top 3 alts to watch in 2026. Solana Price Prediction: Wall Street Investor Scaramucci Picks SOL as Top Altcoin for 2026 – $1,000 SOL Incoming? Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci picked Solana, Avalanche, and Toncoin as his 3 cryptocurrencies that could outperform the market this year. Explaining why he chose Solana, the entrepreneur and former lawyer said that SOL is “cheap, low cost, very fast, easy to use, easy to develop on.” And while clarifying that he believes in a “multi-coin world,” Scaramucci explained that he’s singling out Solana because it has all the key attributes a layer-one platform would need to succeed. Of course, one investor’s remarks on their own aren’t enough to move a major token such as Solana, yet we can see from its chart today that it may be very close to a breakout. Not only has a bullish pennant been forming over the past few months, but also SOL’s two primary indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are about to turn positive after weeks of negativity. Source: TradingView Indeed, Solana has been in an oversold position for so long now that a major rally is overdue, and it looks like such a rally could be beginning. Solana’s fundamentals also point towards strong growth this year, given that Solana remains the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of total value locked, at $9.3 billion. It’s also worth pointing out that its DEX volume, at $2.97 billion, is higher than Ethereum’s, which stands at a less impressive $1 billion. We’ve also seen the launch of several SOL ETFs in recent weeks , with 2026 likely to bring many more, pushing up the Solana price even higher. Based on this, we could see SOL hit $150 by the end of January, $250 by Q2, and then $1,000 by the end of 2026. Solana-Based Bitcoin Hyper is Ready to Launch Bitcoin’s First Ever Layer-Two Network: Next 100x Alt? As strong as Solana looks right now, traders may want to maintain a diversified portfolio in order to increase their exposure to potential gains. One way of doing this is to allocate some funds to presale coins, which, under the right conditions, can rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is what Solana-based layer-two network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is hoping to do, with its sale now having raised $30 million so far. Ringing in 2026 in style. 30M Raised! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/dZ4WkGMSvv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) January 1, 2026 This makes Bitcoin Hyper’s one of the biggest presales of the last 12 months, and indicates that it could become very popular once it launches. What’s interesting about Bitcoin Hyper is that it’s in the process of launching an L2 network for Bitcoin, one that is aiming to provide investors with a whole DeFi ecosystem in which to put their BTC to work. It harnesses Solana’s Virtual Machine, giving it a level of speed and scalability that will make it one of the fastest L2s around, while also making it compatible with Solana-based dapps. By depositing BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, users will receive a corresponding amount of HYPER, which they can then use with the L2’s growing range of dapps and protocols. In other words, they will be able to lend out the value of their Bitcoin, or they could stake their tokens and earn a yield, which currently stands at 39% APY. This is why Bitcoin Hyper has performed so well during its sale, which investors can join by going to the project’s official website . HYPER currently costs $0.013515, although this price will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts.

Instead of a broad-based rally, most altcoins suffered deep and prolonged drawdowns, erasing years of gains and forcing many investors out of the market. As 2026 approaches, sentiment around altcoins remains fragile. A growing number of analysts now warn that the worst may not be over, arguing that structural weakness, declining liquidity, and fading retail participation could drive another leg lower across the sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Market data reinforces this cautious outlook. The Crypto Total Market Cap, excluding the top 10 assets—commonly referred to as the OTHERS index—has collapsed by more than 50% since December 2024. Market capitalization has fallen from roughly $451 billion to around $182 billion in just twelve months, highlighting the scale of capital destruction across mid- and small-cap tokens. This sharp contraction reflects aggressive de-risking, weak demand, and sustained selling pressure across the altcoin market. However, not all analysts are convinced the altcoin cycle is finished. A smaller group points to historical precedents, arguing that periods of extreme underperformance and investor capitulation have often preceded powerful altcoin recoveries. From this perspective, 2026 could mark the delayed arrival of an altcoin season—if liquidity conditions improve and capital rotation resumes. Altcoin Trading Activity Remains Elevated Despite Price Weakness A recent CryptoQuant report challenges the widely held belief that this cycle has produced “no altcoin season.” According to the data, centralized exchange trading volume for altcoins—excluding the top five assets—has reached levels significantly higher than those seen in previous market cycles. In other words, altcoins are being traded more actively than ever, even as prices remain deeply depressed across much of the market. This divergence between volume and price helps explain the prevailing confusion. While many tokens have lost a substantial portion of their value, on-chain and exchange data show that activity has not disappeared. Instead, the market has undergone a structural shift. Retail participation has largely faded after months of losses, with many smaller investors capitulating and exiting positions. Their absence, however, has not resulted in lower overall trading activity. CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that altcoin dominance has increasingly concentrated among larger players. Whales and professional participants now account for a growing share of altcoin volume, using periods of low liquidity and weak sentiment to accumulate positions or actively rotate capital. From this perspective, the current phase may not signal the absence of an altcoin cycle, but rather its transformation. If whale-driven positioning continues and broader market conditions improve, these participants are likely to push prices higher to maximize returns.

After peaking near $450 billion in late 2024, the market has lost more than half of its value, stabilizing around the $200–210 billion zone. This sharp contraction confirms that the altcoin market has experienced a full reset rather than a shallow pullback. From a technical perspective, the structure reflects prolonged compression. Price is currently oscillating around the 200-week moving average (red), a level that historically acts as a long-term equilibrium zone during transitions between bearish and recovery phases. The failure to reclaim the 100-week and 50-week moving averages suggests that upside momentum remains weak and that buyers lack conviction at higher levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Volume dynamics reinforce this view. While periodic spikes appear during sell-offs and relief rallies, there is no sustained expansion in volume that would signal broad-based accumulation. This implies selective positioning rather than widespread risk appetite. Importantly, the market is no longer making aggressive lower lows, indicating that forced selling may be largely exhausted. However, the absence of higher highs keeps the structure neutral-to-bearish. For a meaningful altcoin recovery, OTHERS would need to reclaim the $260–280 billion range and hold above key moving averages. Until then, the chart suggests consolidation, dominance by larger players, and a market still searching for a durable bottom rather than the start of a classic altcoin season.

The conversation addressed how investors can structure their portfolios for the future and how assets such as XRP can be used for long-term retirement without liquidation. Shifting Views on Retirement During the interview, Paul Barron noted that a growing number of individuals in their 40s are setting retirement goals earlier than previous generations. This reflects changing work expectations, as more people seek financial independence sooner rather than planning to remain in traditional employment for several decades. Claver explained that people typically move through different financial stages as they age. He observed that early adulthood is often shaped by learning through experience, while the following years focus on building wealth through careers, investment, and entrepreneurship. By midlife, priorities commonly shift toward restructuring personal goals and enjoying the results of earlier financial decisions. In later years, he stated that many begin to prioritize community support, knowledge sharing, and charitable work, especially when financial stability has already been secured. He added that the modern financial landscape offers more opportunities for wealth creation than previous eras, particularly because of the growth of digital assets. Diversification in Wealth Building Claver emphasized the value of diversification across all age groups. According to him, younger adults usually have a higher tolerance for risk and can allocate more resources to growth-oriented investments. As people approach retirement, he noted they tend to prefer safer assets and consistent returns. He referenced strategies commonly used by high-net-worth families. These approaches often allocate roughly 20–30% to liquid, low-risk holdings such as cash and government securities, another 20–30% toward equities, and approximately 10–20% to real estate due to its benefits for income generation and taxation. Business ownership is also an important component for wealth generation, while cryptocurrency typically represents a smaller allocation, usually between 1–5%, though more aggressive investors may choose to increase this portion based on risk preference. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Using XRP for Long-Term Retirement Planning Barron requested insight on how investors could retain XRP and similar cryptocurrencies for retirement without selling them. He noted interest in assets including XRP, Bitcoin, HBAR, XLM, and yield products from networks such as Flare. Claver stated that DAG prioritizes helping clients establish proper structures for asset management rather than advocating for a specific product. He highlighted Wyoming as one of the most advantageous jurisdictions for digital asset ownership due to legal protections and favorable regulations. He revealed that his firm has assisted clients in forming nearly 7,500 limited liability companies in the state, many of which are used to store assets such as XRP, ETH, Solana, MATIC, Chainlink, and others. These LLCs are generally created as holding entities rather than trading entities so that assets qualify for long-term capital gains treatment and remain shielded from operational risk. He further noted that these structures can provide legal protection, as creditors cannot seize assets directly but may only request a charging order. To complement LLCs, DAG often integrates living trusts for clients. These trusts, which may be revocable or irrevocable depending on preference, ensure smooth inheritance without probate processes. Claver stated that the firm currently establishes living trusts for $500, with an upcoming increase to $1,000. Trusts can hold various assets, including digital currencies, property, vehicles, precious metals, and valuable possessions. Claver’s perspective illustrates how digital assets such as XRP can play a role in long-term retirement planning when combined with proper legal structure, diversification, and strategy. Rather than relying solely on selling tokens for profit, investors can position assets within LLCs and trusts to preserve wealth, maintain control, and pass holdings to future generations.

This analysis examines the complex technical landscape, historical precedents, and market dynamics shaping Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Support Battleground Technical analysts worldwide are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action as the cryptocurrency tests pivotal support levels established during April’s market correction. The monthly chart currently shows Bitcoin finding tentative support near its 20-month exponential moving average (EMA), a level that successfully contained the previous major correction. However, market observers note that repeated tests of this crucial zone could weaken its effectiveness over time. According to recent technical assessments, a monthly close below both the 20-month EMA and April’s low would represent a significant break in Bitcoin’s established uptrend. Such a development could potentially initiate a downward trajectory targeting the $50,000 psychological support level. This scenario gains additional credibility when examining historical patterns and market structure developments. Bearish Technical Indicators Converge on Cryptocurrency Markets Multiple technical warning signals are emerging simultaneously across different timeframes. On weekly charts, analysts observe the potential formation of a “dead cross” pattern, where the 20-week EMA threatens to fall below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This technical event last occurred in January 2022 and preceded significant market declines throughout that year. The technical landscape reveals several concerning developments: Support Level Erosion: Repeated tests of the April support zone may diminish its strength Pattern Formation: Potential Head and Shoulders pattern development suggesting trend reversal Momentum Shifts: Declining volume and weakening buying pressure across exchanges Timeframe Alignment: Bearish signals appearing simultaneously on weekly and monthly charts Bitcoin Key Technical Levels and Implications Technical Level Current Status Bullish Implication Bearish Implication 20-Month EMA Testing Support Holds as springboard for recovery Break triggers trend reversal April Low Support Under Pressure Establishes higher low pattern Confirms breakdown structure Weekly Dead Cross Forming Avoided through price recovery Confirms medium-term bearish shift $50,000 Level Psychological Support Major accumulation zone if reached Next major support if breakdown occurs Historical Context and Market Psychology Market analysts emphasize the importance of historical context when evaluating current technical developments. The cryptocurrency market has experienced similar technical setups during previous cycles, with outcomes varying based on broader market conditions, institutional participation levels, and macroeconomic factors. The current technical warnings mirror patterns observed before significant corrections in both 2018 and 2022, though market structure has evolved substantially since those periods. Institutional adoption has changed market dynamics considerably since previous bearish technical formations. Traditional financial institutions now participate more actively in cryptocurrency markets, potentially altering how technical patterns play out. However, technical analysis principles remain relevant as they reflect collective market psychology and trader behavior across all participant categories. Divergent Analyst Perspectives on Market Direction While technical charts currently favor bearish interpretations, cryptocurrency analysts remain divided about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Some market observers argue that current technical warnings may represent temporary volatility rather than sustained trend reversal. These analysts point to fundamental factors including institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and technological advancements as counterbalancing forces. Alternative perspectives suggest that technical breakdowns could represent buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Historical data shows that significant corrections often precede substantial rallies in cryptocurrency markets. However, proponents of the bearish outlook emphasize that risk management requires respecting technical warnings until proven invalid by price action. The analytical community generally agrees on several key points: Current technical setup warrants cautious positioning and risk management April support represents a critical line in the sand for market structure Volume and momentum indicators will provide crucial confirmation signals Broader market conditions will ultimately determine technical pattern outcomes Market Structure and Pattern Development Implications Technical analysts are particularly concerned about potential pattern developments that could amplify downward pressure. The possible formation of a Head and Shoulders pattern represents one such concern, as this classical technical formation typically signals trend reversal when confirmed. Pattern completion would involve breaking below the “neckline” support level, potentially triggering algorithmic selling and stop-loss orders. Market structure analysis reveals additional complexities. The relationship between spot markets and derivatives markets has created interconnected risks that can accelerate price movements in either direction. Liquidity conditions across different exchanges and trading pairs also influence how technical patterns develop and resolve. These structural factors add layers of complexity to straightforward technical interpretations. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Valuation Beyond pure technical analysis, macroeconomic conditions significantly influence cryptocurrency valuations. Interest rate policies, inflation data, and traditional market correlations all impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Current macroeconomic uncertainty creates additional headwinds for risk assets including cryptocurrencies, potentially exacerbating technical weaknesses. Historical analysis reveals that cryptocurrency markets often experience increased volatility during periods of macroeconomic transition. The current environment features multiple uncertain factors including monetary policy normalization, geopolitical tensions, and shifting regulatory landscapes. These external factors interact with technical patterns to create complex market dynamics that challenge simple predictive models. Several macroeconomic considerations currently affect cryptocurrency markets: Central bank policy shifts and their impact on risk appetite Traditional market correlations and decoupling patterns Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions Institutional adoption pace and capital flow patterns Conclusion Bitcoin price analysis reveals a cryptocurrency at a critical technical juncture, with multiple indicators warning of potential declines toward $50,000 if key support levels fail. The convergence of bearish technical signals across different timeframes warrants cautious market observation and appropriate risk management. While analyst opinions remain divided about ultimate outcomes, current technical evidence suggests respecting support level tests and pattern developments until market structure provides clearer directional signals. The coming weeks will prove crucial for determining whether Bitcoin maintains its broader uptrend or enters a more significant corrective phase. FAQs Q1: What is the 20-month EMA and why is it important for Bitcoin? The 20-month Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a technical indicator that smooths price data over 20 months, giving more weight to recent prices. It’s important because it has historically acted as dynamic support during bull markets and resistance during bear markets, making its current test significant for trend determination. Q2: How reliable are “dead cross” patterns in predicting Bitcoin price movements? While dead cross patterns (when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term one) have preceded significant declines historically, they’re not infallible predictors. Their reliability depends on confirmation from other indicators, trading volume, and broader market context. The 2022 dead cross did precede declines, but false signals can occur. Q3: What would invalidate the bearish Bitcoin technical outlook? The bearish outlook would be invalidated by a strong weekly close above current resistance levels, particularly with increasing volume. Sustained movement above the 20-week EMA with momentum confirmation would suggest the technical breakdown was false. Fundamental catalysts like major institutional adoption could also override technical warnings. Q4: How does current Bitcoin technical analysis compare to previous market cycles? Current technical warnings share similarities with 2018 and 2022 patterns but occur in a fundamentally different market context. Institutional participation, derivatives markets, and regulatory frameworks have evolved significantly. While technical patterns repeat, their outcomes may differ due to changed market structure and participant behavior. Q5: What time horizon do these Bitcoin technical warnings apply to? These technical analyses primarily address medium-term timeframes ranging from several weeks to several months. Short-term price movements can deviate from these patterns due to news events or liquidity conditions. Long-term trends require analysis of broader fundamentals including adoption metrics, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions.

56749426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258074,1767400511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Whale Accumulation: The Alarming Data Distortion That Could Mislead Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-accumulation-data-distortion/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Accumulation: The Alarming Data Distortion That Could Mislead Investors In a revelation that challenges prevailing market narratives, new analysis exposes how apparent Bitcoin whale accumulation might represent a dangerous data distortion rather than genuine institutional confidence. Senior CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno has identified critical flaws in how the cryptocurrency community interprets on-chain metrics, specifically warning that exchange wallet activities are creating misleading signals about whale behavior. This discovery comes at a crucial time for Bitcoin investors navigating complex market conditions in early 2025. Understanding the Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Narrative For years, cryptocurrency analysts have monitored whale addresses as key indicators of market sentiment. These large holders, typically controlling between 100 and 10,000 BTC, traditionally signal market direction through their accumulation or distribution patterns. However, recent data interpretations suggesting substantial whale accumulation may stem from fundamental misunderstandings of blockchain data structures. According to Moreno’s analysis, most circulating transaction data fails to properly filter exchange holdings from genuine whale activity. The cryptocurrency market has increasingly relied on on-chain analytics for investment decisions. Platforms tracking whale movements have gained significant traction among both retail and institutional investors. Nevertheless, the complexity of blockchain data interpretation presents substantial challenges. Exchange wallet reorganizations, for instance, can create artificial spikes in apparent whale activity that inexperienced analysts might misinterpret as accumulation signals. The Mechanics of On-Chain Data Distortion Blockchain analysis requires sophisticated filtering to distinguish between different types of wallet activities. Major cryptocurrency exchanges typically manage thousands of wallets containing customer funds, institutional holdings, and operational reserves. When these entities reorganize their storage systems, the movement of substantial Bitcoin amounts between addresses can appear identical to whale accumulation patterns on basic analytical platforms. Moreno emphasizes that data excluding exchange addresses actually indicates decreasing BTC holdings among genuine whales. This trend extends to addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a category that increasingly includes exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings. The distinction between ETF custodial wallets and traditional whale addresses further complicates accurate data interpretation. Expert Analysis from CryptoQuant’s Senior Analyst Julio Moreno brings substantial expertise to this analysis, with years of experience interpreting cryptocurrency market data. His previous accurate predictions about market cycles lend credibility to his current warnings about data misinterpretation. Moreno previously stated his belief that Bitcoin has already passed its cycle high and is heading toward a low, making his current analysis particularly relevant for investors assessing market direction. The implications of this data distortion extend beyond academic interest. Investment decisions based on misinterpreted whale accumulation signals could lead to substantial financial losses. Retail investors following apparent accumulation trends might enter positions at inopportune times, while institutional players could make allocation decisions based on flawed premises. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Data Interpretation Blockchain data analysis has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s inception. Early analysts worked with limited tools and basic metrics, while today’s sophisticated platforms offer hundreds of indicators. This evolution has created both opportunities and challenges for accurate market interpretation. The table below illustrates key differences between genuine whale activity and exchange-related movements: Characteristic Genuine Whale Accumulation Exchange Wallet Reorganization Transaction Pattern Consistent purchases from multiple sources Large transfers between known exchange addresses Address Behavior Long-term holding after acquisition Frequent movement between custodial wallets Timing Often correlates with market conditions Occurs during exchange infrastructure updates Data Source Reliability Requires exchange-filtered analysis Appears in unfiltered on-chain metrics Understanding these distinctions requires specialized knowledge of both blockchain technology and exchange operations. Analysts must consider multiple factors when interpreting apparent accumulation signals: Address clustering techniques to identify exchange-controlled wallets Historical behavior patterns of specific addresses Correlation with exchange announcements about wallet upgrades Verification through multiple data sources before drawing conclusions Market Impact and Investor Implications The potential misinterpretation of whale accumulation data carries significant consequences for cryptocurrency markets. Investment strategies based on flawed premises could amplify market volatility and create artificial price movements. Furthermore, the credibility of on-chain analytics as a decision-making tool faces challenges if basic metrics prove unreliable without expert interpretation. Institutional investors increasingly incorporate blockchain data into their analysis frameworks. Hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers have developed sophisticated models using whale movement indicators. The discovery of potential data distortions necessitates reevaluation of these models and their underlying assumptions. Retail investors face particular challenges in navigating this complexity. Without access to advanced analytical tools or expertise in blockchain data interpretation, they risk making decisions based on incomplete or misleading information. Educational resources about proper data interpretation become increasingly valuable in this environment. The Role of Analytical Platforms in Data Transparency CryptoQuant and similar platforms play crucial roles in improving data transparency. By developing more sophisticated filtering algorithms and educating users about interpretation challenges, these services enhance market efficiency. The ongoing development of better analytical tools represents a positive trend for cryptocurrency market maturation. Platform improvements might include: Enhanced exchange wallet identification algorithms Clear labeling of potentially distorted metrics Educational content about data interpretation limitations Multiple data visualization options showing filtered and unfiltered views Broader Trends in Cryptocurrency Market Analysis The challenge of accurate data interpretation extends beyond whale accumulation metrics. Multiple aspects of cryptocurrency analysis face similar complexities requiring expert navigation. Market participants must develop more sophisticated approaches to data evaluation as the ecosystem matures. Several trends are shaping cryptocurrency market analysis in 2025: Increased institutional participation bringing traditional financial analytical rigor Regulatory developments affecting data reporting requirements Technological advancements in blockchain analytics platforms Growing recognition of data interpretation as a specialized skill These developments collectively push the industry toward more reliable and sophisticated analytical practices. However, the transition period creates challenges for investors accustomed to simpler metrics and interpretations. Conclusion The apparent Bitcoin whale accumulation that has captured market attention may represent a significant data distortion rather than genuine institutional accumulation. Julio Moreno’s analysis highlights critical flaws in how exchange wallet activities can mimic whale behavior in unfiltered on-chain metrics. This discovery emphasizes the importance of sophisticated data interpretation in cryptocurrency markets, particularly as institutional participation increases. Investors must approach whale accumulation signals with appropriate skepticism and seek multiple verification sources before making decisions based on these metrics. The maturation of cryptocurrency markets requires parallel development in analytical sophistication, with this revelation about data distortion serving as an important milestone in that evolution. FAQs Q1: What exactly is meant by “Bitcoin whale accumulation data distortion”? This refers to the phenomenon where exchange wallet reorganizations and movements appear identical to genuine whale accumulation in basic on-chain analytics, creating misleading signals about large investor behavior. Q2: How can investors distinguish between real whale activity and exchange movements? Investors should rely on analytical platforms that filter exchange addresses, examine transaction patterns for consistency with accumulation behavior, and correlate movements with exchange infrastructure announcements rather than market conditions. Q3: Why does this data distortion matter for cryptocurrency investors? Misinterpreted whale signals could lead to poor investment timing and decisions based on flawed premises, potentially resulting in financial losses and increased market volatility. Q4: What does CryptoQuant’s analysis suggest about actual whale behavior? According to Julio Moreno’s filtered data analysis, genuine whale holdings (excluding exchange addresses) are actually decreasing, contradicting unfiltered metrics suggesting accumulation. Q5: How has cryptocurrency data analysis evolved to address these challenges? Analytical platforms have developed more sophisticated address clustering algorithms, better exchange wallet identification, and educational resources to help users properly interpret complex blockchain data.

In a Jan. 1 post on X, Jeff Yan framed “integrity” and “credible neutrality” as design constraints, not marketing language. Hyperliquid Reaffirms ‘No Insiders’ Ethos “Integrity has always been one of Hyperliquid’s core values. The house of all finance must be credibly neutral. This means no private investors, no market maker deals, and no protocol fees to any company,” he wrote , drawing a straight line between governance legitimacy and the absence of paid counterparties. That posture also extends to the origin story. “The initial state of any blockchain is a crucial part of its story that can never be erased. The original ethos of Bitcoin was a permissionless network accessible to all. Hyperliquid’s genesis distribution followed this spirit, going entirely to early users with core contributors excluded,” the post continued, adding that “the full distribution is verifiable onchain without obfuscation.” The founder acknowledged that this approach is not always convenient for would-be partners or ecosystem builders accustomed to preferential terms. “This principle of fairness frustrates a few users and builders who are used to special treatment,” he said, arguing it forces the community to “do things the hard way”, including “zero tolerance” for “integrity yellow flags” among team members. It is not the first time he has put the stance in blunt terms. In a January 2024 post, he summarized the policy as: “No investors. No paid market makers. No fees to the dev team… No insiders @HyperliquidX.” Lighter Debut Sparks Controversy The timing matters because the on-chain perpetuals category is now fighting not just over latency and liquidity, but over distribution optics, and Hyperliquid’s most visible new rival has become a live case study. Lighter, an Ethereum-based perpetual futures exchange that also operates as an Ethereum layer-2, launched earlier this week and has climbed quickly in the rankings. On Dec. 30, it airdropped 250 million LIT tokens, 25% of its 1 billion total supply, to early users, with another 25% set aside for future growth programs. The controversy is the other half. Lighter allocated 50% of supply to employees and investors, subject to a one-year lockup and three-year vesting, a structure that has triggered debate across DeFi about whether “community-first” narratives still hold when insiders retain an equal share of the cap table. In other words, Lighter’s launch has intensified the same ideological fault line Hyperliquid is trying to own: whether the cleanest on-chain market structure is primarily about product performance or about refusing the incentives that come with investors, paid liquidity, and insider allocations.

He urged followers to focus on “the real things” and fundamentals, rather than clinging to failed three-digit forecasts. Versluis reminded the community that XRP began January 2025 at $2.08 and moved to $3.40 by the end of that month. The token then reached a yearly high of $3.66 in July before sliding back to close 2025 at $1.84, which represented an 11.5% YTD decline. “We just look at the fundamentals,” he said, adding that those who loudly predict extreme prices often end up wrong.

One influencer cited a White House confirmation that the CLARITY Act markup is scheduled for January 2026, which supporters believe may clarify crypto rules and encourage institutional flows. Based on reports, such policy milestones are being watched closely by investors who expect clearer rules to broaden participation. Focus On Systems Over Hype As for Coach JV’s public statements on this issue, he emphasized and stressed the process more than making predictions. JV explained that he maximized cash-value life insurance as part of his wealth strategy, managed debt very carefully, and created systems which enforce discipline on himself and his business.

This change, according to the chairman, may be essential for future stock splits, as Ether’s price has a significant impact on the company’s value. Lee noted that BitMine’s share price is keeping up with Ether’s price . To effectively forecast future values, the executive carefully observed the ETH/Bitcoin ratio. Based on his argument, if, by any chance, BTC achieves a peak of $1 million, ETH would secure an all-time high of $250,000. At this point, Lee asserted that this rise would significantly increase the price of BitMine’s shares to highs he anticipated would be unreachable for many retail investors. Lee demonstrates a strong commitment to increasing the total number of BitMine’s shares In 2025, BitMine started as a Bitcoin mining and holding firm . Later, after careful consideration, the company shifted its focus to embracing an ETH treasury strategy. However, sources pointed out that BitMine continues to conduct some Bitcoin operations. Regarding his prediction, Lee declared that if ETH attained a peak of $250,000, BitMine shares could encounter an implied cost of approximately $5,000 each. Reports stated that this price is costly for several regular investors. To support this claim, the chairman mentioned that not everyone desires stocks to be priced at $500, $1,500, or $5,000; instead, a large group of individuals wants shares to be priced around $25. Meanwhile, apart from this finding, Lee also acknowledged that if ETH reaches an all-time high of $250,000, BitMine would be required to carry out a 100:1 stock split to maintain the share price at $25. With the move in place, the firm’s shares are expected to increase the total number to 43 billion. In a statement, Lee mentioned, “Right now, there are 426 million shares available. We aim to increase the authorized share count to 50 billion. However, that doesn’t mean we will actually create 50 billion shares; that’s just the highest number we want.” Reports highlighted that Lee is referring to the unit bias issue. Unit bias, in the basis of finance, is the psychological tendency for investors to prefer owning whole units of an asset (like a whole Bitcoin or share) over fractions, or to equate a low price per unit with better value, even when the total investment value is the same or a fractional amount of a pricier asset is a better investment. Lee’s idea faces criticism Regarding Lee’s proposal to increase the total number of BitMine’s shares, reports pointed out that several users shared negative responses to this suggestion on X. Some argued that it is unwise to raise the limit of authorized shares because this act would dilute the stock. This discussion made headlines, sparking controversy among individuals in the crypto ecosystem. One user remarked, “Tom, this seems shady and silly to raise the share count just because the stock could hit $500. You should wait until next year when it’s not in such bad shape.” Nonetheless, despite these concerns, recent reports highlighted that BitMine purchased approximately 32,938 ETH on Tuesday of this week for more than $102 million, based on current prices. Notably, as of December 2025, BitMine’s treasury had expanded to more than 4 million ETH, valued at over $12 billion. The firm also began staking ETH to generate income.

This investor began converting a massive $44.3 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) today, marking the end of a four-year holding period for the ETH assets. The transaction, first reported by blockchain analytics, represents one of the most notable single-asset shifts of 2025 and provides a compelling case study in long-term crypto investment strategy. Crypto Whale Executes $44.3 Million ETH to BTC Conversion According to data from AmberCN and corroborated by on-chain analysis, the whale address commenced the swap approximately five hours before reports surfaced. The entity exchanged 14,145 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) for 492 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Consequently, this transaction executed at a precise swap ratio of 1 WETH to 0.03478 WBTC. Therefore, the average purchase price for the WBTC settled at $90,014 per coin. This decisive action follows a period of accumulation that began in early 2022. Initially, the wallet accumulated a total of 22,344 ETH through major exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, and Poloniex. The average acquisition price for this Ethereum stash was $2,916 per ETH. The current move to convert a large portion into Bitcoin suggests a strategic reassessment of asset allocation. Market analysts are now scrutinizing the timing and potential motivations behind this substantial shift. Analyzing the Four-Year Holding Period and Market Context The whale’s four-year holding period is a critical piece of context. The accumulation phase in early 2022 occurred just after Ethereum’s all-time high in late 2021, during a broader market cooldown. Holding through the subsequent market cycles, including the bear market of 2022-2023 and the recovery phases, demonstrates a high-conviction, long-term approach. Now, the decision to rotate into Bitcoin may signal a change in that conviction or a tactical adjustment based on macroeconomic or protocol-specific factors. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 includes several evolving narratives. These include Bitcoin’s maturation as a institutional reserve asset, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades to its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and the regulatory clarity emerging in key jurisdictions. A whale of this size likely considers all these elements. Their move could be interpreted as a vote for Bitcoin’s relative stability or ‘digital gold’ narrative over Ethereum’s ‘world computer’ utility thesis, at least for a portion of their portfolio. Expert Perspective on Large Holder Behavior Historically, movements from large holders often precede or coincide with broader market trends. While a single transaction does not dictate market direction, it provides a valuable data point for sentiment analysis. Seasoned analysts note that whales typically move assets for several key reasons: portfolio rebalancing, risk management, capital deployment for other investments, or anticipation of specific market movements. The transparent nature of blockchain allows the market to observe these signals in real-time, adding a layer of strategic depth to crypto asset trading. The table below summarizes the key transaction details: Asset Sold Amount USD Value Holding Period Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) 14,145 $44.3 Million ~4 Years Asset Bought Amount USD Value Average Price Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) 492 $44.3 Million $90,014 per BTC Furthermore, using wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) indicates the swap likely occurred on a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or a decentralized exchange (DEX). This method offers privacy and direct asset control compared to centralized exchange transfers. The choice of instrument itself is a minor but insightful detail about the whale’s operational preferences. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The immediate market impact of a $44.3 million swap is often absorbed by liquid markets for BTC and ETH. However, the psychological impact can be more significant. Such a move can influence retail and institutional sentiment, potentially leading to increased discussion about the BTC/ETH ratio—a key metric watched by crypto traders. A shift of this scale from a long-term holder may prompt other investors to reevaluate their own allocations between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Key considerations for the market include: Sentiment Signal: Does this indicate a loss of confidence in Ethereum’s short-term prospects or a gain in confidence for Bitcoin? Technical Pressure: While $44.3M is a large sum, both ETH and BTC markets handle daily volumes in the billions. Direct price pressure may be minimal but observable. Follow-on Activity: Market participants will monitor if this whale completes the conversion of its remaining ETH holdings or if other large holders mimic the strategy. Ultimately, this event underscores the dynamic and transparent nature of cryptocurrency markets. Major player movements are public, providing a continuous stream of actionable intelligence for all market participants. It also highlights the evolving strategies within digital asset portfolio management as the asset class matures. Conclusion The $44.3 million crypto whale transaction from Ethereum to Bitcoin is a noteworthy event in the 2025 digital asset landscape. It exemplifies strategic portfolio management by large-scale investors after a multi-year holding period. While the anonymous whale’s specific motivations remain private, the move provides tangible data for analyzing market sentiment between the two premier cryptocurrencies. This action reinforces the importance of on-chain analytics and serves as a reminder that even in a decentralized ecosystem, the behavior of major holders offers crucial insights into market dynamics and evolving investment theses. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades have the potential to influence the market price due to the size of their transactions. Q2: Why use WETH and WBTC instead of native ETH and BTC? Wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) are ERC-20 token representations of native assets on the Ethereum blockchain. They are commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate seamless trading and lending without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. Q3: Does this large sale mean the whale is bearish on Ethereum? Not necessarily. Portfolio rebalancing is a common practice. The whale may still hold a significant amount of ETH (over 8,000 ETH based on reported accumulation) and might be taking profits, managing risk, or increasing exposure to Bitcoin for strategic diversification rather than expressing a purely bearish outlook on Ethereum. Q4: How can such a large trade be executed without drastically moving the price? The trade was likely executed using a decentralized exchange aggregator or a liquidity protocol that splits the order across multiple pools to achieve the best average price (a method known as ‘batch swapping’ or using ‘smart order routing’). Both BTC and ETH also have deep liquidity, allowing large orders to be filled with minimal slippage. Q5: Where can I track whale movements like this one? Several blockchain analytics platforms and services specialize in tracking large transactions and whale wallet activity. These platforms monitor blockchain data in real-time, flagging significant transfers, accumulations, and distributions from known large holders.

56751660,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=871856,1767405607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56751660.jpeg,Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-data-shows-aggressive-sellers-in-control-as-btc-consolidates-below-90k/,newsbtc,"Bitcoin closed the year slightly in the red, marking a rare break in the long-observed four-year cycle pattern of one red year followed by three green years. The annual decline was modest—around 6%—and negligible compared to historical drawdowns seen in prior bearish years. Yet despite its limited magnitude, the red close carries symbolic weight, suggesting a shift in market behavior rather than outright weakness. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Recent on-chain analysis from Axel Adler adds important context to this change. Data tracking cumulative Net Taker Flow shows that aggressive buying peaked around the New Year before fading. Since then, the balance of market aggression has tilted toward sellers, though not in an extreme way. The indicator currently sits in a moderate negative range, signaling that sell-side pressure has increased but remains far from capitulation levels. Historically, similar conditions have tended to coincide with heightened downside sensitivity rather than immediate trend reversals. In practical terms, this suggests that Bitcoin is vulnerable to further weakness if demand fails to recover, but it is not yet displaying the stress typically associated with deeper bear phases. The key takeaway is nuance. Bitcoin is not collapsing, but it is no longer behaving like an asset in a clean, momentum-driven expansion. The shift toward moderate sell pressure, combined with a rare red yearly close, points to a market transitioning into a more complex and selective phase rather than following its familiar cycle script. Derivatives Momentum Turns Cautious as Sell-Side Pressure Aligns Adler’s analysis highlights a growing shift in short-term market behavior through the Bitcoin Net Taker Flow momentum metric, which tracks how aggressively traders are positioning on the long or short side. Unlike cumulative flow, this indicator is designed to react quickly to sentiment changes, offering an early read on shifts in trader behavior rather than longer-term positioning. In recent sessions, this momentum gauge has rolled over decisively. After holding positive territory in late December, the smoothed reading has slipped into negative levels, now hovering around -0.3. While this does not yet reflect extreme stress, it places the market firmly in a moderate bearish pressure regime. The timing is notable: the momentum downturn occurred alongside a deterioration in cumulative Net Taker Flow, reinforcing the signal rather than contradicting it. This alignment matters. When both cumulative pressure and short-term momentum weaken together, it reduces the likelihood that the move is driven by noise or isolated positioning. Instead, it points to a broader shift in trader aggression toward the sell side. Adler notes that deeper downside risk would emerge if momentum continues to weaken, particularly if readings push beyond the -0.4 threshold. Conditions suggest controlled but persistent selling pressure. Bitcoin is not yet in capitulation territory, but the synchronized signals indicate that bearish forces currently have the upper hand, increasing sensitivity to any loss of price support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Distribution Re-Emerges: BTC Enters A Fragile Price Phase Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Momentum Remains Fragile Bitcoin is consolidating around the $88,000–$90,000 zone after a sharp pullback from its recent highs. Reflecting a market caught between stabilization and lingering downside risk. Price remains below the short-term and medium-term moving averages, signaling that bullish momentum has not yet been reclaimed. The 50-period moving average has turned into dynamic resistance, while the 100-period average is flattening, reinforcing the idea of a broader compression phase rather than an immediate trend reversal. Importantly, Bitcoin is still holding well above the 200-period moving average, which continues to slope upward. This suggests that, from a higher-timeframe perspective, the broader structure has not fully broken down. However, the loss of the $100,000–$105,000 region earlier marked a clear regime shift from expansion to distribution. Increasing sensitivity to sell-side pressure. Volume has notably declined during the recent sideways movement, indicating a lack of conviction from both buyers and sellers. This supports the view that the market is digesting prior excesses rather than aggressively repricing lower. Still, repeated failures to push back above the $92,000–$95,000 range highlight weak demand at higher levels. As Bitcoin holds the $85,000–$88,000 support band, consolidation remains the dominant scenario. A breakdown below this area would likely open the door to deeper retracements.

56752434,651993,1767407413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56752434.jpeg,Peter Schiff Says The Bitcoin ‘Good News’ Era Is Over In 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-bitcoin-good-news-era-over-2026/,bitcoinist,"Peter Schiff is starting 2026 with a blunt message for Bitcoin holders: in his view, the trade is crowded, the “good news” is exhausted, and the unwind is already visible in the vehicles built to maximize BTC exposure. Schiff’s Bitcoin Prediction For 2026 In a Jan. 1 “Year-End Special” episode outlining his 2026 market forecasts, the renowned Bitcoin-critic argued that the cryptocurrency spent 2025 doing the one thing it wasn’t supposed to do in a year packed with pro-crypto narratives: fall. He framed that underperformance as the tell for what comes next. Schiff contrasted BTC’s year against both risk assets and his preferred macro hedges. Stocks finished 2025 higher, he cited the Dow up 13%, the S&P 500 up 16.4%, and the Nasdaq up 20.4%, while gold rose 64% and silver more than doubled. Bitcoin, he said, was the outlier on the wrong side. “Everybody on CNBC was pounding the table on when the year began was Bitcoin,” Schiff said, describing a narrative mix that included “a Bitcoin president,” “a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” heavy corporate buying, and the growth of ETFs. “Bitcoin was one of the only things that was down on the year.” He pointed to ETF performance to ground that claim, saying he checked where Bitcoin ETFs “closed because they’re done for the year,” and that they were “down just over 7.5% on the year,” even as the Nasdaq and gold posted large gains. Then he delivered the core of his setup: “If something doesn’t go up when everybody thinks it’s going to go up, that’s a pretty good indication that it’s going to go down,” he said. “If a market can’t go up on good news, that means all that good news is already priced into the market […] and that means all that it can do is go down.” Strategy As The “Poster Boy” Stress Test Schiff also used Strategy, the market’s most visible leveraged Bitcoin proxy, as his preferred diagnostic for sentiment and structural demand. He said Strategy finished 2025 at a new 52-week low and was “down 47.5% on the year” and “67% below its peak 52-week high,” calling it “the poster boy” for maximum BTC leverage. Schiff’s argument was not that Strategy failed to buy BTC but that the equity market was already pricing the downsides of the model. Schiff went further, claiming Strategy’s five-year average BTC cost basis sits around $75,000, implying only a modest gain with Bitcoin near $87,000. “That’s about a 16% gain, 3% a year over 5 years,” he said, arguing it undercut the pitch that the trade is a one-way compounding machine. He also claimed Strategy could not realistically exit at its average price without slippage, framing the “profit” as fragile in a liquidation scenario. From there, Schiff extended the thesis into 2026 market structure: if Strategy slows or stops buying, and if ETF flows flip decisively negative, marginal demand may not be there when it’s needed. “The ETFs are selling now,” he said. “They’ve gone from big Bitcoin buyers to consistent Bitcoin sellers.” While Schiff refrained from naming a BTC price target for 2026 in the video, the gold bug set a downside “minimum target” of about $50,000 mid-December 2025. He argued that Strategy could not fall as much as he expected without Bitcoin also taking a major leg lower. Year-End Special: My 2026 Economic and Market Forecasts https://t.co/pqy8bWJBjP — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 1, 2026 The Macro Backdrop Schiff’s broader 2026 macro call was a mix of weaker growth, stickier inflation, and intensifying political pressure on monetary policy, conditions he expects to support precious metals and pressure Bitcoin. He argued the Fed is already effectively back in easing mode: “it just went back to quantitative easing, even though it hasn’t officially acknowledged that that’s what it’s doing” and expects further rate cuts alongside a weakening dollar. He also tied tariffs to higher consumer prices and margin pressure, forecasting a 2026 environment where “the economy is going to be weak” while “inflation is going to be strong,” a combination he called “toxic.” Schiff’s practical conclusion for crypto listeners was direct: he urged viewers to “get rid of your Bitcoin above $87,000,” while reiterating that he expects capital to rotate toward gold and silver as “the bloom comes off that crypto […] tulip.” At press time, BTC traded at $89,517.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Peter Schiff,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This incremental yet significant one-point rise, reported by data provider Alternative on April 10, 2025, follows the index’s crucial migration from the ‘Extreme Fear’ category into the ‘Fear’ category just a day prior, potentially foreshadowing a change in market dynamics. Consequently, analysts and traders are scrutinizing this movement for clues about future price action and capital flows. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Climbs: Decoding the 29 Reading The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it quantifies sentiment where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 29, therefore, firmly places the market in the ‘Fear’ zone, but notably on an upward trajectory away from the extreme pessimism that often characterizes market bottoms. This index does not rely on a single metric; instead, it synthesizes data from six distinct sources to provide a holistic view. Specifically, its calculation incorporates: Market Volatility (25%): Current price swings compared to historical averages. Market Volume (25%): Trading activity and momentum on major exchanges. Social Media (15%): The volume and sentiment of crypto mentions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polling data from various community platforms. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. The recent climb to 29 suggests positive momentum across several of these components, particularly in trading volume and social media sentiment, which have historically led shifts in the broader index. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis Understanding the importance of the move to 29 requires examining historical patterns. For instance, prolonged periods in ‘Extreme Fear’ (typically below 25) have frequently coincided with accumulation phases, where long-term investors enter the market. The index’s escape from this territory often precedes periods of consolidation or gradual recovery. By contrast, a sustained move above 50 into ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ has historically correlated with market peaks and increased risk. The current reading, therefore, represents a transitional phase. Market analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often cross-reference this sentiment data with on-chain metrics, such as exchange net flows and holder composition, to validate the sentiment shift. Their recent reports indicate a decrease in coins moving to exchanges for sale, aligning with the less fearful sentiment reading. Expert Insight: The Mechanics of Sentiment Shifts Dr. Lena Vance, a behavioral finance economist at the Digital Asset Research Institute, explains the underlying mechanics. “The Fear & Greed Index is powerful because it quantifies the herd mentality,” she states. “A move from 20 to 29 may seem small, but in behavioral terms, it reflects a measurable reduction in panic-driven decision-making. Investors are beginning to process information more rationally, rather than reacting purely to negative headlines or short-term volatility.” This perspective is supported by data from the past month, which shows a stabilization in Bitcoin’s realized volatility and a modest increase in stablecoin inflows to exchanges—a potential precursor to buying pressure. Furthermore, the index’s weighting of social media sentiment captures the nuanced shift from apocalyptic narratives to more balanced discussions about protocol upgrades and regulatory clarity. The Impact of Volatility and Trading Volume The two heaviest-weighted components of the index—volatility and trading volume—deserve particular attention. Over the last fortnight, the 30-day volatility for Bitcoin has contracted by approximately 15%, according to data from TradingView. This compression often indicates a coiling period that can precede a significant price movement. Simultaneously, aggregate spot trading volume across major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken has risen by an estimated 8%. This combination of lower volatility and higher volume can signal the early stages of informed accumulation, as opposed to speculative frenzy. The table below illustrates the recent trend in these key metrics: Metric 30 Days Ago Current Reading Change Impact on Index BTC 30-Day Volatility 68% 58% -14.7% Positive for Sentiment Aggregate Daily Volume $42B $45.5B +8.3% Positive for Sentiment Social Sentiment Score 28/100 35/100 +25% Positive for Sentiment This data-driven improvement directly feeds into the index’s calculation, providing a factual basis for the climb to 29. Broader Market Implications and Future Trajectory The easing sentiment captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not exist in a vacuum. It interacts with macro-financial conditions, including interest rate expectations and global liquidity. In early 2025, with central banks in a holding pattern, cryptocurrency markets are finding their own footing based on internal supply dynamics and adoption milestones. A sentiment reading in the ‘Fear’ zone, but rising, typically suggests a market that is healing but remains vulnerable to negative shocks. For portfolio managers, this environment often dictates a strategy of phased re-entry or dollar-cost averaging, rather than all-in speculation. The index also provides a contrarian indicator for retail investors; historically, buying during periods of sustained fear has yielded positive long-term returns, though past performance is never a guarantee of future results. The key watchpoint now is whether the index can sustain its move and challenge the neutral level of 50, which would require consistent positive inflows and a supportive macro backdrop. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 29 represents a meaningful, data-backed shift in market psychology from extreme pessimism toward cautious optimism. This movement, driven by improvements in volatility, trading volume, and social sentiment, provides a quantifiable snapshot of a market in transition. While firmly remaining in the ‘Fear’ category, the upward trajectory suggests that the peak of investor capitulation may have passed, allowing for a more stable foundation for price discovery. Market participants should monitor this index alongside on-chain fundamentals and macroeconomic developments, as the journey from fear to greed is rarely linear. The current reading of 29 offers a hopeful sign that the market is processing information more calmly, a necessary step for sustainable long-term growth. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 29 mean? A reading of 29 places the market in the ‘Fear’ category, but on an upward trend from ‘Extreme Fear.’ It indicates that negative sentiment is easing, though investors remain generally cautious rather than optimistic or greedy. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is compiled and published daily by the data provider Alternative. It aggregates real-time data from volatility, volume, social media, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of Bitcoin’s price? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. It reflects current market emotion. Historically, sustained extreme fear has often preceded price rebounds, while extreme greed has signaled market tops, but it should be used alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools. Q4: Why is Bitcoin’s market dominance a factor in the index? Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. Shifts in dominance often reflect risk appetite; investors may flee to Bitcoin (‘digital gold’) during fear and into altcoins during greed, making it a useful sentiment gauge. Q5: How should a trader or investor use this index? Primarily as a contrarian indicator and a gauge of market temperature. Extreme readings can signal potential turning points. A rising index from fear levels, like the current move to 29, can suggest it’s time to research opportunities, but never to base a trade solely on this single metric.

56752886,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258088,1767408311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin Season Index Stalls at 23: A Revealing Signal of Bitcoin’s Enduring Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinmarketcap-altcoin-season-index-23/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Stalls at 23: A Revealing Signal of Bitcoin’s Enduring Dominance In a revealing signal for cryptocurrency market observers, CoinMarketCap’s pivotal Altcoin Season Index has registered a score of 23, firmly indicating a market cycle dominated by Bitcoin’s performance. This critical metric, updated on a continuous basis, provides a data-driven snapshot of capital rotation between the flagship cryptocurrency and the broader altcoin universe. Consequently, investors and analysts are closely monitoring this figure for early signs of a potential regime shift, as historical patterns suggest these cycles dictate portfolio performance for months. The current reading, far from the 75 threshold needed to declare an ‘altcoin season,’ underscores a period where Bitcoin continues to command market leadership and investor preference. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Mechanics CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index operates on a transparent and methodical calculation. Fundamentally, the index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. However, the algorithm makes crucial exclusions to ensure clarity; it deliberately filters out stablecoins like USDT and USDC, alongside wrapped tokens such as WBTC, which merely mirror Bitcoin’s price. The core calculation is straightforward: it measures the percentage of these top 100 assets that have outperformed Bitcoin. A result of 75% or higher triggers the official declaration of an altcoin season, a condition last observed in early 2021. Conversely, a score below 25 strongly suggests a Bitcoin season, where the pioneer cryptocurrency outshines most alternatives. The current score of 23 sits precisely within this Bitcoin-dominant territory. The Historical Context of Market Cycles Understanding the index’s current position requires examining past crypto market cycles. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the charge, attracting institutional and mainstream capital first. Subsequently, as Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates at higher levels, investor appetite for risk increases, leading capital to flow into altcoins with higher growth potential—this is the classic altcoin season. For instance, the index surged above 75 for extended periods during the 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 bull runs. The prolonged period since 2022, however, has been characterized by lower index readings, reflecting a post-bear market environment where safety and established store-of-value narratives favor Bitcoin. This cyclical rhythm between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance is a well-documented phenomenon in cryptocurrency market analysis. Implications of a Score of 23 for Investors The index’s low reading carries significant practical implications for portfolio strategy. Primarily, it suggests that a momentum-based approach focused solely on altcoins may underperform relative to a strategy with Bitcoin exposure. Market data from similar periods shows that during strong Bitcoin seasons, capital tends to be concentrated, leaving many altcoins struggling for momentum. Therefore, investors might prioritize Bitcoin and perhaps the largest, most liquid altcoins (often called ‘blue-chip’ alts) during this phase. Nevertheless, a low index can also signal a potential accumulation phase for selective altcoins before a possible rotation. Seasoned analysts often view extreme readings in either direction as potential contrarian indicators, though timing such shifts remains notoriously difficult. Key characteristics of a Bitcoin-dominant market (Index below 25) include: Heightened focus on macroeconomic factors like interest rates and inflation. Strong relative performance of Bitcoin against the total crypto market cap (BTC Dominance). Reduced trading volumes and volatility across smaller altcoin projects. Increased narrative strength around Bitcoin as a digital gold and institutional asset. Expert Analysis on Current Market Structure Market structure experts point to several concurrent factors explaining the low Altcoin Season Index. First, the regulatory environment in 2024-2025 has created uncertainty for many altcoin projects, particularly those deemed securities by regulators. This uncertainty naturally benefits Bitcoin, which has achieved clearer regulatory status in major markets like the United States. Second, the successful launch and adoption of Bitcoin spot ETFs have funneled billions in traditional finance capital directly into Bitcoin, creating a demand shock that altcoins have not yet experienced. Finally, the broader risk-off sentiment in global markets, influenced by geopolitical tensions, has made investors cautious about the high-beta nature of most altcoins. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s dominance, as reflected in the index score. Comparing Alternative Market Health Indicators While the Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool, prudent analysts cross-reference it with other metrics. For example, the Bitcoin Dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, often correlates strongly with this index. Other useful indicators include the performance ratio of Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) and the collective market cap of altcoins excluding the top 10. Currently, most of these complementary metrics align with the Altcoin Season Index’s message. The ETH/BTC ratio, a bellwether for altcoin strength, has remained in a downtrend or consolidation pattern, further validating the index’s low reading. This confluence of data from multiple sources strengthens the reliability of the current market diagnosis. The Path Forward: Monitoring for a Regime Shift Market participants are now watching for catalysts that could push the Altcoin Season Index higher. Potential triggers include decisive regulatory clarity for altcoins, the approval of spot ETFs for assets like Ethereum, or a sustained period of sideways movement in Bitcoin’s price that prompts investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. Historically, the transition from a Bitcoin season to an altcoin season is not instantaneous; it is a gradual process where the index climbs from lows, through a neutral zone, and finally breaches the 75 level. Therefore, a sustained move above the 50 level would be the first technical signal of strengthening altcoin momentum. Until then, the market structure favors the incumbent. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, registering at 23, delivers a clear and data-backed message: the cryptocurrency market remains in a phase of Bitcoin dominance. This reading, derived from the comparative performance of the top 100 assets, is a crucial tool for navigating complex market cycles. While it presents challenges for altcoin investors in the short term, it also provides a framework for anticipating future rotations. Ultimately, understanding this index allows for more informed, strategic decisions aligned with the prevailing market regime. As the crypto landscape evolves, this metric will continue to serve as an essential barometer for the ever-shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and the expansive world of altcoins. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 23 mean? It means that only an estimated 23% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. This indicates a market strongly favoring Bitcoin, known as a ‘Bitcoin season.’ Q2: How often is CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is calculated and updated on a continuous, real-time basis by CoinMarketCap, reflecting the most recent 90-day rolling performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q3: Has the index ever been wrong in predicting market cycles? The index is a descriptive metric, not a predictive one. It reports on what has already happened over a 90-day period. While it is an excellent indicator of the current trend, past performance does not guarantee future results, and external shocks can change market dynamics rapidly. Q4: Should I avoid altcoins entirely when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index suggests a challenging environment for broad altcoin momentum, but it can also be a period for researching and accumulating fundamentally strong projects at lower valuations. Portfolio allocation should always align with individual risk tolerance and investment horizon. Q5: What is the difference between this index and the ‘Bitcoin Dominance’ metric? Bitcoin Dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. The Altcoin Season Index measures price performance over time. While they often trend together, they are different measurements; one is a snapshot of value share, and the other is a snapshot of momentum performance.

Currently hovering just above $89,200, Bitcoin recently saw its 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages (SMAs) cross paths on December 8, a development highlighted by market analyst Ali Martinez on social media site X (previously Twitter). Bitcoin May Face 50%-60% Correction Martinez emphasized the importance of watching the behavior of these two moving averages on the weekly chart. Historically, each time Bitcoin has registered a death cross between the 10-week and 50-week SMAs, it has been followed by substantial corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 As seen in the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart below, past occurrences of such crossovers have led to price declines of 67% in September 2014, 54% in June 2018, 53% in March 2020, and 64% in January 2022. With the recent death cross-forming, Martinez suggests that if history is any guide, Bitcoin could face a correction between 50% and 60%, which would place its price anywhere between $50,000 and $38,000. Adding another layer of complexity to the analysis, market expert Mags has outlined two potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s near future. Two Scenarios For BTC’s Future Following Bitcoin’s downturn since its October highs above $126,000, it has been trading around the $85,000 mark for several weeks. Coinciding with this, Tether’s USDT dominance has broken out of its previous range, currently maintaining levels above the breakout zone. Since Bitcoin and USDT dominance exhibit an inverse correlation, Mags has identified two main scenarios moving forward. The first, a bullish scenario, hinges on the idea that if USDT dominance begins to decline, the current breakout could turn out to be a fakeout. Mags asserts that such a move could potentially ignite another expansion in Bitcoin’s price, possibly even leading to a new all-time high before any significant distribution occurs. Related Reading: Here’s How Much The XRP Price Will Be If It Overtakes Ethereum In Market Cap Conversely, Mags outlined a second scenario indicating early signs of a bearish structure. If the broader market trend weakens, Bitcoin might experience a temporary bounce, while USDT dominance forms a higher low near its mid-range before trending back upwards. In this case, BTC would exhibit a slow distribution pattern, marking neither a crash nor a rapid decline, but rather a gradual, choppy downward movement characteristic of initial bearish market behavior. The next move in USDT dominance is poised to play a crucial role in determining whether the current market represents a mere pause before further price continuation or the onset of an extended distribution phase leading up to a new all-time high.

Analyst Thinks So—Here’s Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-heading-0-08-analyst-thinks-heres-why/,newsbtc,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin could be on track for $0.08 based on this breakout from a consolidation channel. Dogecoin Has Fallen Under An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where Dogecoin could be heading based on a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Channel,” which is a type of Parallel Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Defined by Demand, Not Price: CryptoQuant Head Says Parallel Channels appear whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. When these lines have a positive slope, the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. This channel corresponds to consolidation that occurs toward some net upside. Like other such patterns in TA, the upper line acts a source of resistance, while the lower one provides support. A break out of either of these boundaries can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel may be a bullish signal, while a drop under it a bearish one. Like the Ascending Channel, there is also a pattern in TA called the Descending Channel, emerging when the opposite type of consolidation takes place. That is, when the price moves to a net downside between two parallel trendlines with a negative slope. Until recently, Dogecoin had been trading inside a multi-year Ascending Channel on the 3-day timeframe. The memecoin capped off 2025 with a breakout from it, as the chart shared by Martinez shows. From the above graph, it’s apparent that Dogecoin has escaped the long Ascending Channel with a fall below the support trendline. The memecoin has since been following a steep downward trajectory, a potential sign that the bearish breakout is in effect. Breakouts from Parallel Channels are considered likely to end up being of the same height as the distance between the trendlines. Based on this, the analyst has put the $0.08 target for DOGE. It now remains to be seen whether the asset will follow this trajectory or if it will see a rebound before long. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case In another X post, Martinez has highlighted how Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has also been trading inside a TA consolidation pattern recently. As displayed in the chart, the pattern in the case of Bitcoin is a Symmetrical Triangle, a channel that involves two lines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. BTC’s 4-hour price has been moving sideways in this pattern recently and based on its height, the analyst thinks that the coin may be set up for a 15% move. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.13, up more than 8% over the last 24 hours.

56754795,651974,1767412808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56754795.jpeg,Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Return To Losses Despite Elevated Price Levels – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/short-term-bitcoin-holders-return-losses-price/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin closed 2025 with a modest annual loss, breaking the familiar pattern of strong year-end performance and reinforcing growing concerns that the market may be transitioning into a more challenging phase in 2026. As macro uncertainty, fading liquidity, and weak risk appetite weigh on sentiment, an increasing number of analysts are openly discussing the possibility of a prolonged bear market. Still, price action tells a more nuanced story. Bitcoin remains locked in consolidation, and the absence of aggressive downside continuation has opened the door to a potential relief rally in the near term. On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds important context to this setup. Recent metrics show that short-term holders—investors who typically drive momentum during trend expansions—have slipped back into net losses. Aggregate realized profit and loss for this group has turned negative again, with margins hovering near -12%. This deterioration is notable because it is occurring while Bitcoin’s price remains relatively elevated compared to previous cycle drawdowns, suggesting that stress is building beneath the surface rather than after a full capitulation. Historically, periods where short-term holders operate at a loss often coincide with late-stage corrections or consolidation phases within broader market transitions. While this does not confirm a market bottom, it highlights fragility in near-term demand and reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is at a critical inflection point as 2026 approaches. Short-Term Holder Stress Signals a Market at a Crossroads Recent on-chain observations suggest Bitcoin is entering a delicate phase where short-term holders are increasingly under strain. When newer market participants slip into losses, it often signals that price has moved faster than incoming demand can comfortably absorb. In past cycles, this condition has typically appeared near the later stages of corrections or during extended sideways phases, rather than at the start of deep bear markets. What makes the current setup notable is Bitcoin’s proximity to the average acquisition price of short-term holders. This zone has historically acted as a psychological and behavioral battleground. When price hovers near this level, market reactions tend to intensify, as traders decide whether to cut losses or hold through uncertainty. The outcome often defines whether consolidation continues or volatility expands. Importantly, the scale of losses remains moderate compared to historical capitulation events. Previous market resets, such as those seen in 2018 or mid-2022, were characterized by far deeper and more prolonged stress among short-term holders. The absence of similar extremes today suggests that, while sentiment is weak, the broader market structure has not yet broken down. That said, persistent pressure on short-term holders reflects fragile near-term demand. If losses begin to narrow, it could signal stabilization and set the stage for a relief move. If they widen instead, downside moves are more likely to accelerate. Bitcoin Consolidates Below $90K Bitcoin price action on the 3-day chart shows a clear transition from trend expansion to consolidation following the sharp correction from the $120K–$125K region. After losing the 50-day and 100-day moving averages during the November breakdown, BTC accelerated lower before finding demand in the mid-$80K zone. Since then, price has stabilized and is now compressing just below $90K, suggesting that downside momentum has slowed materially. The current structure reflects a market in equilibrium rather than capitulation. Bitcoin is trading above the 200-day moving average, which continues to slope upward, preserving the broader bullish structure from a higher-timeframe perspective. However, the declining 50-day and 100-day averages overhead are acting as dynamic resistance, capping upside attempts and preventing a clean trend reversal for now. Selling pressure peaked during the November decline, but recent candles show reduced volume, consistent with seller exhaustion rather than aggressive accumulation. This often precedes a range-bound phase where the market digests prior gains. From a technical standpoint, holding the $85K–$88K region is critical. A sustained defense of this area keeps the consolidation intact and opens the door for a relief rally toward the $95K–$100K zone. Conversely, a decisive loss of this support would expose Bitcoin to a deeper retracement toward the 200-day average, shifting the short-term bias back to the downside.

His release took place on January 2, 2026, several years before the completion of his original sentence. Lichtenstein credited his early release to provisions under the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform law signed in 2018, which allows sentence reductions for inmates who participate in rehabilitation programs and demonstrate good conduct. How the First Step Act Led to an Early Release Lichtenstein was arrested in February 2022 alongside his wife, Heather Morgan, after US authorities traced nearly 120,000 BTC stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the arrest, the stolen Bitcoin was valued at approximately $4.5 billion, making it one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in US history. In November 2024, Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to money laundering conspiracy. However, according to his statement following release, his participation in rehabilitation and educational programs made him eligible for sentence reduction under the First Step Act. From a Mid-Market Bitcoin Era to a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Asset When the Bitfinex hack occurred in August 2016, Bitcoin was trading at roughly $600–$650 per coin. At those prices, the 120,000 BTC stolen during the breach were valued at approximately $72–$78 million, a substantial amount at the time but within a far smaller and less developed crypto market. Nearly a decade later, Bitcoin trades at levels that fundamentally reshape the historical significance of the incident. With Bitcoin priced around $90,000 in early 2026, the same 120,000 BTC would now be worth approximately $10.8 billion, representing an increase of more than 140 times compared with its estimated value at the time of the hack. Cooperation With Authorities Played a Role Beyond rehabilitation efforts, Lichtenstein cooperated with US authorities during ongoing investigations. In 2024, he testified in the case involving the cryptocurrency mixer Bitcoin Fog. The operator of the service was later sentenced to 12.5 years in prison, a development prosecutors cited as a significant enforcement milestone. Heather Morgan received a more lenient sentence of 18 months in prison and was released in October 2025 after serving approximately eight months. Following her arrest, she gained widespread attention on social media for her musical project under the pseudonym Razzlekhan, which became a viral internet phenomenon. What the Case Signals for Crypto Enforcement Lichtenstein’s release comes amid broader discussion about how the US justice system handles cryptocurrency-related crimes. In recent years, sentencing outcomes have increasingly reflected cooperation, restitution efforts, and rehabilitation rather than punishment alone. Following his release, Lichtenstein stated that he plans to use his technical background in cybersecurity, marking a notable shift from one of the most high-profile crypto crime cases toward a potential role in digital security. The case underscores how enforcement strategies and sentencing frameworks in the crypto sector continue to evolve as authorities balance deterrence, recovery of assets, and long-term reintegration.",News|Legal,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,0,0,EN,"{

This significant inflow, led dominantly by financial giant BlackRock, completely erased the prior day’s outflows and signaled robust institutional appetite for cryptocurrency exposure at the start of the new trading year. The data, compiled by industry tracker TraderT, provides a clear snapshot of investor sentiment and capital movement within this pivotal financial instrument category. Bitcoin ETF Inflow Breakdown and Market Leaders BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) commanded the day’s activity, single-handedly drawing $280.12 million in net inflows. Consequently, this massive vote of confidence from investors solidified IBIT’s position as the category leader. Other major issuers also reported positive flows, creating a broad-based rally. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $88.08 million, while Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) gathered $41.49 million. Furthermore, several other funds contributed to the total, including Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($12.99M), VanEck’s HODL ($8.26M), Ark Invest’s ARKB ($6.71M), and Invesco’s BTCO ($4.47M). Notably, Grayscale’s offerings also participated, with its flagship GBTC adding $15.42 million and its Mini BTC Trust attracting $6.35 million. The following table summarizes the key inflows for January 2, 2025: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (USD) IBIT BlackRock $280.12M FBTC Fidelity $88.08M BITB Bitwise $41.49M EZBC Franklin Templeton $12.99M Contextualizing the Spot Bitcoin ETF Phenomenon The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024 represented a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike futures-based products, these funds hold physical bitcoin, providing direct exposure to the asset’s price. This structure appeals to a wide range of investors, from large institutions to financial advisors and retail participants. The January 2nd inflow data is particularly noteworthy because it follows a period of typical year-end portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, which often pressures asset prices. Therefore, the strong start to 2025 suggests a renewal of strategic, long-term allocation rather than short-term speculation. Market analysts often interpret consistent ETF inflows as a measure of sustained institutional demand. These flows require the ETF issuer to purchase equivalent amounts of bitcoin on the open market to back the new shares. This process creates a direct, mechanical buy-pressure on the underlying asset. Over time, this dynamic can significantly impact bitcoin’s supply and demand equilibrium, especially considering its fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Trends Financial experts point to several factors driving this renewed interest. First, macroeconomic conditions, including monetary policy expectations, can influence asset allocation decisions. Second, the maturation of cryptocurrency custody and regulatory frameworks has reduced perceived operational risks for large institutions. Third, the competitive fee structures among ETF issuers, with some even offering temporary fee waivers, have made access more cost-effective. The dominance of traditional asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity in the inflow rankings underscores their existing, vast distribution networks and client trust, which are effectively channeling capital into the digital asset space. The trajectory of these funds is also closely watched for its impact on bitcoin’s market structure. As ETF holdings grow, the proportion of bitcoin supply considered “locked” in long-term investment vehicles increases. This trend potentially reduces the liquid supply available for trading, which can decrease market volatility and increase price stability over the long term. However, analysts caution that outflow days will also occur, reflecting normal market cycles and profit-taking behavior. Comparative Performance and Market Impact When comparing the performance of different spot Bitcoin ETFs, factors beyond daily flows become critical. Investors and advisors typically evaluate expense ratios, liquidity (as measured by average daily trading volume), and the reputation of the custodian safeguarding the assets. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have consistently led in net asset gathering since their launches, benefiting from their globally recognized brands and extensive relationships with wirehouses and registered investment advisors (RIAs). The collective action of these ETFs has several tangible market impacts: Price Discovery: They integrate bitcoin pricing into traditional equity market hours and systems. Accessibility: They provide a familiar, regulated wrapper for exposure, bypassing the complexities of direct custody. Legitimization: Their existence and growth signal regulatory acceptance to a broader investor base. Data from the broader blockchain ecosystem often reflects ETF activity. On days of substantial net inflows, on-chain analysts may observe larger-than-normal transfers of bitcoin to known custodian addresses, such as Coinbase Custody, which secures assets for multiple ETF issuers. This on-chain transparency provides a secondary layer of verification for the reported flow data. Conclusion The $463.9 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 2, 2025, marks a decisive and optimistic start to the year for cryptocurrency investment products. Led by BlackRock’s IBIT, this collective movement of capital demonstrates resilient institutional demand and a swift recovery from prior outflows. As these regulated vehicles continue to mature, their flow data will remain a crucial barometer for measuring mainstream financial adoption of digital assets like bitcoin. The sustained growth of these funds not only impacts bitcoin’s market dynamics but also solidifies the asset’s position within the modern, diversified investment portfolio. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds physical bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Q2: Why are net inflows important for Bitcoin ETFs? Net inflows are crucial because they represent new capital entering the fund. The issuer must use this cash to purchase an equivalent amount of bitcoin, creating direct buy-side pressure on the market. Consistent inflows indicate growing investor demand and can influence bitcoin’s price. Q3: What was the significance of the January 2, 2025, inflow data? The $463.9 million inflow was significant because it represented a strong reversal from outflows on the previous day. It signaled renewed institutional investment interest at the very beginning of the new trading year, often interpreted as a positive sentiment indicator. Q4: How does BlackRock’s IBIT differ from Grayscale’s GBTC? Both are investment products offering bitcoin exposure, but they have different structures. IBIT is a newly launched spot ETF with a competitive management fee. GBTC was converted from a closed-end trust into a spot ETF. Their fee structures, historical performance, and liquidity profiles differ, influencing investor choice. Q5: Do Bitcoin ETF flows directly cause bitcoin’s price to rise? While not the sole factor, significant net inflows contribute to upward price pressure. The ETF issuer’s market purchases to back new shares increase demand. However, bitcoin’s price is also affected by global macroeconomic factors, broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, and technological developments.

Despite recent headlines proclaiming that large BTC wallets have been aggressively buying the dip, deeper blockchain data reveals a more nuanced reality. The head of research at the platform, Julius Moreno, cautioned that what appears to be whale accumulation is actually exchange-related activity inflating perceptions of buying. Exchanges frequently reorganize funds into other wallets, thereby increasing the number of wallets with massive balances . Moreno commented on X: “No, whales are not buying an enormous amount of Bitcoin. Most BTC whale data out there has been ‘affected’ by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances. This is why whales seem to have accumulated a lot of coins recently.” Blockchain analytics firms report that long-term Bitcoin holders — wallets that have held their BTC for extended periods — have shifted back into net distribution after a prolonged accumulation phase. The Coinbase executive comments come as sentiment among crypto market participants on social media has started the year strong, according to a Santiment analyst, who warned that further market upside depends on retail investors staying level-headed. “We need retail to continue to be a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, a bit impatient,” Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said in a video published to YouTube on Saturday. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators showing fear among market participants, Quinlivan said Santiment’s social media data points in the opposite direction. Moreno says Bitcoin is still distributing their assets instead of accumulating Moreno noted that adjusted data show that large holders are still in distribution mode, and not accumulation. The data also shows a continued drop in whale holdings, alongside falling balances among 100–1,000 BTC addresses, suggesting ETF outflows persist. Large holders typically make significant changes in the Bitcoin price; however, the market structure is adapting with the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have become substantial market participants. Aside from questions about whale accumulation, sentiment among long-term BTC holders has improved, as indicated by other onchain metrics. According to Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck , long-term Bitcoin holders have once again begun buying after suffering the biggest selling period in years. The trend suggests that the recent selling pressure on BTC might be beginning to ease. The recovery of Bitcoin remains tentative, although downside pressure to date hasn’t forced prices back to the sub-$80,000 range seen in November. BTC is currently trading just above the $90,000 mark. Nonetheless, Bollinger Bands, a key volatility gauge, suggest that a major price swing may be imminent.TradingView data shows Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands—the volatility bands set two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average—have tightened to under $3,500, the narrowest since July. Back in late July, a Bollinger Band squeeze capped a two-week consolidation between $115,000 and $120,000, marking the start of a three-month price expansion that ranged from $100,000 to $126,000. A similar pattern emerged in late February, with Bitcoin consolidating between $94,000 and $98,000 before a Bollinger Band squeeze preceded a decline to $80,000. Kim says Bitcoin will surpass $270,000 by February 2026 The social media predictor and self-proclaimed world’s smartest man, Kim, recently predicted that BTC could jump past $270,000 within a month next year. According to reports, the predictor cited both the growth and fragility of fiat currencies as reasons for his optimistic outlook, noting Bitcoin’s historical volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic trends. The social media personality has made several Bitcoin forecasts in the past that have not held up. He predicted in November that Bitcoin would more than double to $220,000 within 45 days, pledging any future profits toward church construction, yet the price surge never materialized. In addition to his bullish calls, Kim said BTC could replace the US dollar by 2026, labeling the current low as a short-term, manipulation-driven discount.

Related Reading: Ethereum Optimism For 2026: Analysts Share Bullish Forecast Despite Disappointing End-Of-Year Bitcoin Records Least Volatile Year On Friday, K33 Research data revealed that Bitcoin has recorded the least volatile year in the asset’s history. According to the chart, the flagship cryptocurrency saw its lowest volatility level, measured by the average deviation of daily returns, in 2025, hitting just 2.24%. The recent data shows that BTC fell below the previous lowest year on record, 2023, which registered 2.30% volatility. Moreover, it’s annual volatility has also ended below the 3% mark over the past three years, its lowest levels since 2016. This signals a “clear” diminishing trend, K33 Research noted, as Bitcoin’s volatility has been trending lower year by year, suggesting growing market maturity and stabilizing price action. Crypto trader Niels highlighted that “for the first time, BTC recorded its lowest annual volatility on record, lower than every cycle before it, including the early ‘wild west’ years and the post-ETF era.” As he explained, 2025 was “the calmest year in Bitcoin’s history” despite all the price movements of the years, including the Q4 daily corrections, which saw the flagship crypto retrace up to 16% in a single day. It’s worth noting that BTC’s deepest correction in 2025 saw the cryptocurrency drop nearly 36% in a two-month period, while previous cycles’ corrections recorded retraces of more than 50% during similar periods. Previously, Nic Carter addressed the negative sentiment brewing around Bitcoin and the broader market. He detailed that the market could be considered “boring” now because most of the questions that drove the historical volatility have been answered. Carter also asserted that the space matured significantly with “more serious businesses (…), [and] less chaos” in the industry. The Start Of The ‘Institutional Era’ In his X post, Niels also pointed out that the diminishing trend in Bitcoin volatility was fueled by the massive institutional participation, calling for “More capital. More long-term holders. More institutional participation. [and] Less emotional trading” for the future. Similarly, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley has affirmed that the overall crypto market was changing, driven by the significant decrease in regulatory risk, which has led to last year’s spike in institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. Notably, the market saw the second of wave of crypto Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) go live, with funds based on altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP breaking multiple records. In addition, the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) trend, led by Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, poured billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies in 2025.

He noted that rising demand for alternative stores of value and progress on bipartisan US crypto market structure legislation could drive Bitcoin to new highs in the first half of the year. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,240, a 1.54% increase in the daily timeframe.

56757993,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258131,1767420012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidations-short-squeeze/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a dramatic cascade of liquidations totaling approximately $250 million over a critical 24-hour period, with short positions bearing the overwhelming brunt of the losses. This substantial crypto futures liquidations event represents one of the most significant short squeeze scenarios in recent months, highlighting the inherent volatility and leverage risks within digital asset derivatives markets. According to comprehensive data from leading analytics platforms, Ethereum (ETH) led the liquidation wave with $120 million, followed closely by Bitcoin (BTC) at $108 million, while Solana (SOL) experienced $21.95 million in forced position closures. Crypto Futures Liquidations: Understanding the Market Mechanics The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event provides a textbook example of market dynamics in leveraged trading environments. Perpetual futures contracts, which dominate cryptocurrency derivatives trading, allow traders to use significant leverage—often 10x to 100x their initial capital. Consequently, even relatively modest price movements can trigger automatic position closures when maintenance margin requirements fail. Market analysts note that this particular liquidation wave occurred during a period of unexpected bullish momentum across major digital assets. The resulting short squeeze forced cascading position closures as prices moved against traders betting on declines. Derivatives markets serve crucial functions for price discovery and risk management. However, they also amplify volatility through leverage effects. When numerous traders hold similar directional positions with high leverage, the market becomes vulnerable to liquidation cascades. These events typically unfold rapidly as initial liquidations create additional selling or buying pressure. This pressure then triggers further liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. The cryptocurrency market’s 24/7 operation means these events can develop at any time, often catching traders off guard during low-liquidity periods. The Anatomy of a Short Squeeze A short squeeze represents a specific market condition where traders who have sold assets expecting price declines must urgently buy them back to cover their positions. This covering activity creates additional upward buying pressure, which then forces more short positions to liquidate. The resulting feedback loop can produce rapid, dramatic price increases. Historical data from traditional finance shows similar patterns in equity markets, though cryptocurrency markets exhibit amplified effects due to higher leverage availability and continuous trading. Ethereum Leads With $120 Million in Liquidations Ethereum’s derivatives market experienced the most substantial impact during this crypto futures liquidations event, with $120 million in positions forcibly closed. Remarkably, short positions accounted for 89.48% of these liquidations, indicating overwhelming directional consensus among leveraged traders. This percentage translates to approximately $107.38 million in short positions liquidated against just $12.62 million in long positions. The disparity highlights how market sentiment had become excessively bearish on Ethereum before the price movement that triggered the squeeze. Several factors contributed to Ethereum’s prominent role in this liquidation event. First, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization with exceptionally deep derivatives markets. Second, ongoing network upgrades and regulatory developments create uncertainty that encourages leveraged positioning. Third, Ethereum’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets means it often moves in tandem with Bitcoin while exhibiting higher beta characteristics. Traders frequently use Ethereum futures for directional bets on the altcoin market’s overall health. Total Ethereum Liquidations: $120 million Short Position Percentage: 89.48% ($107.38M) Long Position Percentage: 10.52% ($12.62M) Primary Exchanges: Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Deribit The concentration of liquidations across specific price levels reveals important market structure information. Order book data indicates that liquidation clusters occurred near key technical resistance levels that many traders expected to hold. When these levels broke, stop-loss orders and forced liquidations created a vacuum of selling pressure that accelerated the upward move. This pattern demonstrates how derivatives markets can influence spot prices during periods of high leverage utilization. Bitcoin’s $108 Million Liquidation Event Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, witnessed $108 million in crypto futures liquidations during the same 24-hour window. Short positions comprised 83.95% of this total, representing approximately $90.67 million against $17.33 million in long liquidations. While Bitcoin’s percentage of short liquidations was slightly lower than Ethereum’s, the absolute dollar amount remained substantial due to Bitcoin’s larger market size. This event underscores Bitcoin’s continued dominance in derivatives trading volume despite growing altcoin markets. Bitcoin’s liquidation patterns often differ from altcoins due to its unique market characteristics. Institutional participation in Bitcoin derivatives has grown significantly in recent years through regulated products like CME Bitcoin futures. However, the majority of high-leverage trading still occurs on offshore exchanges. The recent liquidations primarily affected these offshore markets, where leverage limits often exceed 100x. Market structure analysis reveals that Bitcoin liquidations frequently cluster around round-number psychological price levels, such as $60,000 or $70,000 thresholds. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Liquidation Comparison Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Total Liquidations $108 million $120 million Short Percentage 83.95% 89.48% Short Value $90.67M $107.38M Long Value $17.33M $12.62M Market Cap Rank #1 #2 The timing of Bitcoin’s liquidations relative to Ethereum’s provides insights into market leadership dynamics. In traditional cryptocurrency market cycles, Bitcoin typically leads price movements with altcoins following. However, in this particular event, Ethereum’s liquidations slightly led Bitcoin’s in both timing and intensity. This pattern suggests evolving market relationships where major altcoins increasingly influence broader sentiment rather than simply reacting to Bitcoin movements. Solana’s $21.95 Million Liquidation Surge Solana experienced $21.95 million in crypto futures liquidations, with short positions representing a staggering 91.05% of the total. This percentage translates to approximately $19.98 million in short liquidations versus just $1.97 million in long liquidations. Solana’s exceptionally high short liquidation percentage reflects its status as a higher-volatility asset that attracts substantial speculative trading. The network’s rapid growth and technical innovations have made it a favorite among derivatives traders seeking amplified returns. Several unique factors contributed to Solana’s disproportionate short liquidation percentage. First, Solana’s derivatives markets have grown exponentially alongside its spot market expansion. Second, the asset’s historical volatility exceeds both Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating more frequent liquidation events. Third, Solana’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets varies more significantly than established assets, creating additional basis risk that can surprise leveraged traders. Finally, Solana’s smaller market capitalization means individual large positions can disproportionately impact prices and trigger cascading liquidations. Market Impact and Recovery Patterns The immediate market impact of these crypto futures liquidations included increased volatility and temporary price dislocations across affected assets. However, markets typically absorb liquidation events within hours or days as liquidity returns and equilibrium reestablishes. Historical analysis shows that post-liquidation periods often feature reduced leverage in the system as risk-averse traders decrease positions. This deleveraging can create calmer trading conditions temporarily before leverage gradually rebuilds. The funding rates on perpetual contracts typically normalize after such events, though they may remain elevated if directional sentiment persists strongly. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis The $250 million crypto futures liquidations event, while substantial, represents a moderate-sized liquidation wave compared to historical extremes. During previous market cycles, single-day liquidation totals have exceeded $1 billion multiple times. For instance, the May 2021 market correction triggered approximately $8.6 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse precipitated over $1 billion in daily liquidations. These comparisons provide important perspective on the relative scale of market stress. Nevertheless, the recent event’s significance lies in its composition rather than absolute size. The extreme concentration in short liquidations—exceeding 83% across all major assets—indicates a market caught leaning heavily in one direction. Such lopsided positioning often precedes trend reversals or accelerated moves as crowded trades unwind. Market technicians refer to this as “contrarian indicator” conditions, where extreme sentiment readings suggest impending mean reversion. The cryptocurrency market’s history contains numerous examples of similar setups preceding substantial price movements. May 2021: $8.6 billion liquidations during China mining ban announcement November 2022: $1+ billion liquidations during FTX collapse March 2020: $1+ billion liquidations during COVID market crash June 2022: $800+ million liquidations during Celsius crisis The increasing sophistication of cryptocurrency derivatives markets has changed liquidation dynamics over time. Early markets featured simpler mechanisms with fewer safeguards, leading to more frequent and severe cascades. Modern exchanges implement circuit breakers, auto-deleveraging systems, and insurance funds to mitigate extreme events. However, as trading volumes and leverage availability have grown, the absolute dollar amounts at risk have increased correspondingly. This evolution represents the natural maturation of financial markets as they scale. Risk Management Implications for Traders The recent crypto futures liquidations event offers crucial lessons for risk management in leveraged trading. First, position sizing relative to account equity becomes paramount during volatile conditions. Traders using excessive leverage relative to their risk tolerance frequently become liquidation candidates during normal market fluctuations. Second, diversification across assets and position directions provides some protection against single-direction liquidation events. Third, monitoring funding rates and open interest can provide early warning signals of crowded positioning that might precede squeezes. Advanced traders employ several strategies to navigate high-leverage environments. These include using stop-loss orders judiciously (while recognizing they can exacerbate moves during illiquid periods), maintaining adequate margin buffers above exchange requirements, and avoiding maximum leverage even when available. Some institutional traders utilize options strategies to hedge leveraged futures positions, creating defined-risk exposures. The growing availability of cryptocurrency options markets has facilitated more sophisticated risk management approaches in recent years. Exchange Mechanisms and Safeguards Cryptocurrency exchanges employ various mechanisms to handle liquidations while maintaining market integrity. Most platforms use a mark price system that averages prices across major exchanges to prevent manipulation through isolated price spikes. When positions reach maintenance margin thresholds, exchanges typically attempt to close them through their order matching systems. If insufficient liquidity exists at reasonable prices, some exchanges trigger auto-deleveraging (ADL) systems that close opposing profitable positions to cover losses. More sophisticated platforms maintain insurance funds accumulated from liquidation fees to cover deficits without ADL. Regulatory Considerations and Market Evolution The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency derivatives continues evolving across jurisdictions. Some regions have implemented leverage limits for retail traders, while others prohibit derivatives entirely for non-accredited investors. These regulatory developments aim to protect consumers from the risks demonstrated by liquidation events. However, they also create fragmentation as traders migrate to less-regulated venues. The ongoing tension between innovation and protection represents a central challenge for policymakers worldwide. Market structure evolution will likely continue addressing liquidation risks through technological improvements. Decentralized derivatives protocols offer alternative approaches using automated market makers and on-chain liquidation mechanisms. While currently smaller than centralized exchange volumes, these decentralized platforms provide different risk profiles and transparency benefits. Their growth could eventually reduce systemic risks from concentrated liquidation events by distributing exposure across multiple venues and mechanisms. Conclusion The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event highlights the ongoing risks and dynamics of leveraged cryptocurrency trading. With short positions accounting for the overwhelming majority of losses across Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana markets, this episode demonstrates how crowded positioning can precipitate rapid reversals. These crypto futures liquidations serve as a reminder that derivatives markets both reflect and amplify underlying spot market movements. As cryptocurrency markets mature, understanding liquidation mechanics becomes increasingly important for all participants—from retail traders to institutional investors. While such events create short-term volatility, they also contribute to market efficiency by removing excessive leverage and resetting sentiment extremes. FAQs Q1: What causes crypto futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance requirement for their leveraged position. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent negative balances, often creating cascading effects when many traders hold similar positions. Q2: Why were short positions disproportionately affected in this event? Short positions faced massive liquidations because prices moved upward against traders betting on declines. This created a short squeeze where covering positions added buying pressure, forcing more liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. Q3: How do crypto futures liquidations impact spot prices? Liquidations can significantly impact spot prices through several mechanisms. Forced buying to cover short positions increases demand, while forced selling of long positions increases supply. These flows can create temporary price dislocations and increased volatility. Q4: What percentage of traders typically experience liquidations? Exact percentages vary by market conditions, but industry estimates suggest approximately 70-90% of retail leveraged traders eventually experience at least one liquidation event, highlighting the risks of trading with high leverage. Q5: How can traders avoid futures liquidations? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks through proper position sizing, maintaining adequate margin buffers, using stop-loss orders strategically, avoiding maximum available leverage, and monitoring market conditions for signs of crowded positioning.

After a tumultuous period, total market capitalization has surged back above $3 trillion. However, many investors are left wondering what the new year has in store for digital assets. Institutions Forecast Bullish Crypto Prices For 2026 According to a recent report by analysts at Bull Theory, the past year proved to be robust for traditional markets, particularly for metals, while cryptocurrencies fell short of expectations. Silver surged by 160%, and gold followed suit with a 66% increase. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) wrapped up 2025 down approximately 5%, despite several positive indicators, such as consistent purchasing by Strategy, strong inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and growing institutional interest. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? 3 Analysts Break Down the Charts Yet, when one asset class lags significantly while liquidity remains abundant, historical trends show that the gap typically narrows. In terms of specific projections, various major institutions and prominent investors have offered their forecasts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Standard Chartered targets Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of 2026, and JPMorgan projects a price of $170,000. Meanwhile, Citi’s base case stands around $143,000, with a more aggressive bull case suggesting a potential rise to $189,000. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest envisions a long-term scenario where Bitcoin could hit $500,000, contingent on widespread institutional adoption. Tom Lee from Fundstrat anticipates Ethereum will trade between $7,000 and $9,000 by early 2026, fueled by the tokenization of real-world assets. New Regulations And Economic Optimism The analysts further highlighted that, unlike previous years, this cycle looks distinct in several key aspects. For one, crypto is no longer encumbered by operating within a legal gray area. New regulatory frameworks, particularly in the US, are poised to offer clearer guidelines, reducing uncertainty and facilitating easier access for institutional investors. The anticipated changes aim for simplified regulations that could enhance market structure while broadening institutional participation beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, several factors suggest that a sharp movement in the crypto markets could be on the horizon. The end of quantitative tightening on December 1, 2025, coupled with a growing GDP, signals a conducive environment for crypto. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 With inflation stabilized below 3% and unemployment at 4.6%, there are indications that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may adopt a more dovish stance, especially with a new Fed Chair expected to take office in May 2026. Overall, as the new year begins, the crypto market finds itself in a position of underperformance rather than excess. This contrasting state often results in rapid repricings as gaps are closed in response to liquidity alignment. As a result, Bull Theory analysts believe that 2026 could very well be the year when these disparities start to correct, leading to a potentially bullish environment for cryptocurrencies.

Turkmenistan’s Crypto Legislation Now In Effect As reported by Associated Press, the Asian nation of Turkmenistan officially recognized mining and exchanging cryptocurrency as legal on Thursday. The move comes after President Serdar Berdymukhamedov signed a law back in November, which allowed crypto companies to obtain registration starting January 1st. Located in Central Asia, Turkmenistan was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union before gaining independence following the USSR’s dissolution in 1991. Today, the country is considered as one of the world’s most isolated, due to strict state control over media, internet access, and foreign business activity. Home to a population of over seven million, Turkmenistan’s economy is dependent on its natural gas reserves, which rank as the fifth largest in the world. China is its main customer at the moment, with a pipeline project aimed at supplying gas to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in the works. For a nation known for tight state control, the move to embrace crypto marks a notable shift. Though, while the country is now open to mining firms and exchanges, it still hasn’t legalized digital assets as a form of payment, currency, or security. Turkmenistan isn’t the only Central Asian nation to have made developments related to the digital asset sector recently. Uzbekistan, located north of Turkmenistan, signed on an initiative related to stablecoin payments in November, approving a regulatory sandbox launch for January 1st. Elsewhere in the region, Iran has taken an even bolder approach, offering to sell advanced weapons systems to foreign governments for crypto, according to a report from Financial Times. The nation is willing to exchange ballistic missiles, drones, and warships for digital assets in a bid to bypass western financial controls, per the report. Bitcoin Has Been Stuck In Consolidation Recently While nations move forward with crypto regulation, the market has been stuck in a phase of consolidation lately, with the Bitcoin price unable to settle on a direction. As the below chart shows, BTC has been ranging between $85,000 and $90,000 during the last couple of weeks. The market slowdown has naturally not been restricted to just Bitcoin; the altcoins have also faced stale price action. Ethereum, for example, has positive returns of over 2% in the past month, which are not too different from BTC’s small decline of 2%. Over the past day, Bitcoin has once again climbed toward the upper end of the range, with its price currently trading around $89,500. Considering the recent pattern, it’s possible that this recovery effort may also fizzle out, but it only remains to be seen how things will play out in the coming days.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto exchanges|crypto mining|Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan Crypto,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

He then asked Grok to remove everyone who isn’t Satoshi from the image. hey @grok remove everyone who is not satoshi from this image. pic.twitter.com/9bvTHWE2dH — Vet (@Vet_X0) January 2, 2026 Grok’s Opinion on Satoshi’s Identity The image featured David Schwartz, a prominent figure in the crypto space who recently announced that he would step down from his role as Chief Technology Officer at Ripple. Alongside Schwartz, it featured Hal Finney, a pioneering cryptographer and the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It also showed Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer known for his significant contributions to the development of digital currency and smart contracts. It also featured the late cybersecurity expert Dan Kaminsky, who was a renowned white-hat hacker and a prominent figure in the field of network security. Grok replied with an edited image that removed three people, leaving only David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. For years, many in the crypto world have speculated that Schwartz is Satoshi , and Grok’s response has drawn renewed attention to these claims. Is Schwartz Really Satoshi? Vet rejected the outcome and challenged the reasoning behind it. He showed skepticism and pushed Grok to explain why it singled out Schwartz. Grok followed up with a clarification. The AI emphasized uncertainty and referenced existing narratives around Satoshi’s identity. Grok pointed to long-running speculation tied to Schwartz’s background . It referenced his early work in cryptography and distributed systems, including patents dating back to the late 1980s, as well as his role at Ripple. Grok also noted that Schwartz has publicly denied being Satoshi Nakamoto and has said he first learned about Bitcoin in 2011 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Schwartz Remains Part of the Theory David Schwartz remains part of Satoshi discussions largely due to public perception and the narratives circulating online. Community speculation often highlights high-profile crypto figures with leadership roles in major projects, and Schwartz fits that profile. His visibility on social media, participation in XRP Ledger development, and engagement with crypto debates give his name repeated exposure. Multiple notable figures have also directly and indirectly suggested that Schwartz is Nakamoto , and the speculation is unlikely to die soon.

The latest rejection came after reports emerged about several explosions felt across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, which were linked to potential strikes by the United States. The cause has not been confirmed yet, but US President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned Venezuela of ground strikes, and deployed a navy task force in the Caribbean. Additionally, the BBC reported that the Trump administration was aware of the explosions today, but there’s no official statement yet. The CNN added that several areas of the city were left without power after the explosions, and agency journalists said they could hear the sound of an aircraft. Although the strikes have not been confirmed to be initiated by the US, BTC’s price felt the consequences immediately after the reports started to go live. The asset, which has been prone to experience enhanced volatility in times of attacks between different nations, stood at around $90,500 after it touched $91,000 yesterday. However, it dumped by over a grand within less than an hour following the first BBC and CNN reports and now sits at $89,500. BTCUSD Jan 3.

About 40% of the top 100 Bitcoin treasury firms are valued by the market at less than the net asset value of their BTC holdings, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. At least 37 companies in the group now trade at discounts to NAV, a notable reversal from conditions seen in Q2 and Q3 2025 when the king coin was changing hands at all-time-high levels. During the first three quarters of the year, most treasury firms possessed sizable premiums and could issue equity above the value of their Bitcoin, raise capital, and buy more coins without immediate shareholder dilution. Nearly 200 public firms now hold more than 1 million Bitcoin collectively, valued at roughly $96 billion in 2026. Among the top 5 BTC DATs by holdings are Strategy , with 672,497 BTC, and MARA Holdings, which owns 53,250 coins. Twenty One Capital holds 43,514 Bitcoin, Metaplanet controls 35,102, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury holds 30,021. Is the Bitcoin DAT model a failure? mNAVs fall steeply When Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) began buying Bitcoin through convertible notes and equity, Bitcoin’s price was slightly above $11,000. Fast forward to 5 years later, an all-time-high value of $126,000 in October must have been a reason for MSTR shareholders to smile, but that wasn’t entirely the case. The model began to falter as equity valuations slipped and BTC prices tanked by over 30% in just three months, not to mention several firms like Strategy had bought the highs. Once stock prices fell below NAV, the business model of issuing new shares to buy Bitcoin became uneconomical, exposing firms to market pressure and investor criticism. A December report from BitcoinTreasuries.net showed that only one BTC treasury company, France-based The Blockchain Group, outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025, since the benchmark US stocks index returned 16% over the year. Every other treasury company was well behind the index, and about 60% of them spent more acquiring BTC than those holdings are currently worth. Pioneers Strategy traded at more than double the value of its Bitcoin last year, but its shares are now at a 17% discount to NAV. Smaller players like Sweden’s H100 Group trade at a 32% discount, Vanadi Coffee trades at a 61% discount to its BTC value, alongside five to six firms near parity, including Brazil-based OranjeBTC. Any modest equity selloff could push them below NAV and make them ripe for a takeover if Bitcoin’s price drop continues. Echoes of distress, delisting on MSCI, and DATs dubbed rug pulls Bitcoin treasuries are being blasted by some naysayers in the crypto community, who believe the companies’ buying spree led to a crypto market pull-down causality. “Every single one of these companies is simply a pump N dump rug pull on their common shareholders. And no, preferred equities won’t save your shitty scheme when you don’t have a profitable underlying business, will not save your shitty stock. You should avoid any company that calls itself a ‘DAT’ or ‘Bitcoin treasury company’. Bunch of scammers and idiots tbh,” complained one user on X. Some companies, seeing the whiplash of red mNAVs, are also stepping back, including Prenetics, a health-sciences firm that began buying Bitcoin in 2025. Cryptopolitan reported that it stopped adding coins on December 4 and will now focus on IM8, a nutritional supplement brand co-founded by former England football captain David Beckham. “We are making disciplined strategic decisions that reflect our experience as operators and our commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value,” Danny Yeung, Prenetics’s chief executive officer, said in a press release. In other related news, index provider MSCI’s decision to exclude companies holding significant BTC reserves from its global benchmarks will be made on January 15. If the NYSE-listed company greenlights its exclusion, estimates from BTC for Corporations show the DATs would be forced to sell between $10 billion and $15 billion over a year. BTC for Corporations, a group advocating corporate Bitcoin adoption, held discussions with MSCI leadership before 2025 came to a close. “We had a very constructive conversation,” said George Mekhail, the group’s executive director.

Despite record FY2025 revenue of $766M and positive operating income of $319M, CLSK's free cash flow remained deeply negative at -$461M, driving continued dilution and increased debt. Management turnover and a $1.15B convertible bond raise signal strategic urgency, with initial data center conversions targeting Sandersville and Texas facilities (200MW each). Full conversion of 1.4GW capacity could yield $1.4B–$2.1B annual revenue, but immediate, complete transition is not the current outlook. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner in transition to using its power capacity for AI data centers. It's a late shift and change of tone from previous guidance, and it's one worth a follow-up. While I think this will be a better business over time than BTC mining, tight cash flows and capital needs make the current valuation unfavorable. Summary of Previous Thesis When I wrote about CleanSpark in March, I was cautious about its status as a BTC mining pure play. This was something that made the company stand out, as other BTC miners were converting many of their assets into data centers. The move, broadly accepted across the BTC mining industry, leverages electrical capacity for an end use that can produce reliable free cash flow. CleanSpark's decision to stay out of it was, therefore, a curious one. Screenshot from previous thesis (Author's display of 10K data) Seen above, their BTC mining business was a cash burner, regularly requiring more shares to be issued, in order to finance operations. CleanSpark was betting that competitors' shift to data centers would make their mining operations more competitive, as it would give them a greater share of the global hash rate and therefore improve their BTC output. Nevertheless, BTC still needed to appreciate considerably to turn cash flows positive. Lacking those in the meantime and threatened by continual dilution that would kill off realized upside, I gave CLSK a cautious Hold rating. Updates and Subsequent Events In the months that followed, CleanSpark proceeded with the BTC mining pure play approach. They expressed growing confidence that the business would become self-sufficient, announcing a financing deal with Coinbase ( COIN ) in April. They stated that a portion of BTC mined would be used to sustain operations. Later, they touted reaching 50 exahashes per second in their mining. CEO Zach Bradford stated: As we look to the future, CleanSpark has laid the foundation to achieve 60 EH/s and beyond. This expansion capacity aligns with the Company's broader strategy to grow with capital efficiency only possible for an operator that has achieved escape velocity . ""Escape velocity"" was a term used in both cases, expressing that CleanSpark was near to achieving what I was afraid they would not achieve: an end to cash burn and shareholder dilution. Cash Flow Statements (Q2 & Q3 Fiscal 2025 Forms 10Q) In spite of this, there was still a total cash burn of $234M in fiscal Q3, after accounting for operating cash flow, purchase/disposition of miners, BTC proceeds, and purchase of fixed assets. If Bradford believed CleanSpark was reaching escape velocity, the numbers were not yet bearing it out. Whether he was right or wrong, Bradford resigned as CEO shortly after fiscal Q3 results were released. He was replaced by Matt Schultz, Bradford's fellow co-founder and predecessor as CEO (from 2014 to 2019). In early September, new management announced a strategic pivot to data centers. CleanSpark was finally on the AI-hyperscaler train. Stepping outside of self-funding operations, CleanSpark began raising capital again, such as a recent $1.15B convertible bond offering in November . End of Fiscal 2025 Financials Fiscal 2025 was, in large part, a record year for the company, with revenue reaching an all-time high of $766M. This also supported operating income finally turning positive, reaching $319M. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) For many folks this is a welcome sign, but the cash flow situation reveals some underlying cracks, coming out of the year. Cash Flow Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) While cash burn was lessened somewhat by reduced capex on miners and liquidation of BTC, operating cash flow still decreased overall for the year, reaching -$461M. BTC 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) Some likely recall the recent decline of the price of BTC in the fall. For CleanSpark, the fiscal year ended before this drop. They were mining BTC at prices above $100K for a large portion of the year. Fiscal 2025 Form 10K In order to raise capital and plug the gap, CleanSpark shares outstanding, basic and diluted, have both grown in the year, so the consequences of dilution persisted. Liabilities (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) They ended the year with significantly more debt, largely from the credit facilities they started throughout the year. Then there are the convertible bonds issued later that I mentioned earlier. Overall, it's a somewhat improved picture but still a company with serious capital needs. Outlook and Valuation CLSK trades for about $10 per share and a market cap of $2.6B. As free cash flow has been negative, the task is to determine how following the shift to data centers can tip the scales into positive cash flow. Much of what I will say next will work with very general estimates, given the lack of specifics at this stage. To start, I've looked at similar deals by other companies to give us an idea of what rates they could make with their electrical capacity: Applied Digital's ( APLD ) contract with a hyperscaler Another deal between APLD and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) Ionic Digital's contract with Nscale These contracts show that a data center can make about $1M to $1.5M per MW each year. I've included a table for your convenience. Author's display of data center revenue estimates Total electrical capacity was reported to be 1.4 GW in November. If we assume their total portfolio of capacity were used for data centers today, one could imagine revenue of $1.4B to $2.1B annually, dependent on the rates of local markets and the like. Of course, that assumes complete and immediate conversion of these assets, which isn't the outlook. During the Q4 earnings call , management largely highlighted the Sandersville and Texas facilities as the first places that could be converted to AI/HPC uses. Q4 Fiscal 2025 Investor Presentation These two sites are reported to have about 200 MW of capacity each that could be active by 2027. They could contribute about $400M to $600M in revenue. As the business currently has gross margins of about 55% just on its BTC mining, the underlying assumption is that the average margin for AI/HPC would be meaningfully superior to this. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) The devil is going to be in the details, but a look at key expense items currently show that these assets could produce an additional $100M to $200M in operating income. The upfront capex, however, means that free cash flow would likely not turn positive for some time, however. Liquid Assets (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) As CleanSpark ended fiscal 2025 with only $43M in cash and is slow to liquidate its $967M BTC holdings, this is why they had to do the $1.15B convertible bond offering in November and have leaned into their BTC-backed credit facilities instead. The cash from the convertibles should be sufficient to cover capex needs for the next couple of years (if recent years are a guide). Additional cash burn from operating expenses will force them to raise more capital at some point, and this will likely entail some kind of a dilutive offering. When I see a market cap of $2.6B, I think the fundamentals should practically produce a cash flow multiple of about 10 within a few years. The timing of things makes it seem unlikely they will hit such a milestone in a few years without diluting more. The guidance in the call, after all, was: Our focus is on building a capital stack, which minimizes dilution . Management realizes what I realize and can only promise to dilute as little as possible. I think CLSK needs to be more conservatively valued for it to reflect a real shot at undervaluation. A market cap of $1.5B, which would make an entry price of $5.80 or less, is one that seems to allow for a slower realization of positive cash flow and likely some kind of margin of safety. That isn't to say that a very patient investor couldn't see upside on CLSK at the current valuation, but we're likely thinking very far into the future and imagining that execution goes very well for the most part. Fiscal Q1 results, as well as monthly updates of power capacity, will be important in assessing just how large the pipeline is and how much higher-margin revenue could be realized that isn't on the table right now. Conclusion CleanSpark likely made a pivot that needed to be made, even before BTC prices declined. Nevertheless, strategic transitions take time and cost money. CLSK meanwhile is valued in the billions, when generating cash in the hundreds of millions without more dilution remains an open question. Investors can simply wait for a more reasonably priced entry, and for that reason, I maintain my previous Hold rating.",CLSK,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

According to the Financial Times and follow-up coverage , the listings on Mindex’s export platform include items ranging from drones and air defense systems to warships and ballistic missiles. The move was reported in January 2026 and marks a clear change from past, quieter uses of digital assets. Accepting Crypto And Barter To Avoid Banking Limits Based on reports, Mindex has placed offers that mention cryptocurrency, Iranian rial, and barter as possible forms of payment. The listings encourage potential buyers to contact Iranian officials to negotiate contracts. Sanctions from the US, the UK and the EU have shut many conventional payment routes, and Iranian officials appear to be using multiple channels — crypto among them — to keep export deals moving. Listings Include Broad Array Of Hardware Mindex’s catalogue, as described by multiple outlets, lists equipment across a wide spectrum: small arms and ammunition, drones, missiles, air defense systems, and naval vessels. Reports say Mindex claims commercial ties with about 35 countries. That number helps show the scale Iran’s exporters say they serve, even while facing banking isolation. How Crypto Fits Into Iran’s Cash Flows According to authorities outside Iran , the country has used cryptocurrency before to move value around borders. US Treasury findings previously tied more than $100 million in crypto flows to Iranian oil-related activity that skirted sanctions. Observers warn that accepting crypto for arms could make tracking payments harder, depending on the coins and the custody arrangements used. Some analysts say public listings could attract buyers who already avoid SWIFT and traditional banking. Governments and sanctions experts have raised alarms. If deliveries happen after crypto payments are received, enforcement agencies will face fresh tracing challenges. The US has a record of sanctioning networks that used crypto to support Iranian programs, and officials have signaled they will monitor new tactics closely. Some countries may consider tighter rules on crypto services used in cross-border defense deals. Based on reports , the export agency presents the offers as open to negotiation and claims sanctions will not stop contracts from being fulfilled. What remains unclear is how many, if any, arms contracts will actually be completed using crypto. There are also unanswered questions about which cryptocurrencies would be accepted, how escrow and delivery would be handled, and what intermediaries might be involved.

According to the analyst, any upside movement in the market will depend on retail investors staying level-headed. In a video published recently, Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan mentioned that for the market to see an upside, it needs retail investors to continue being a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, and a bit impatient. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators pointing to fear among market participants, the analysts pointed out that Santiment’s social media data among investors and market participants points the other way. Crypto kickstarts the new year with an impressive social chatter According to Quinlivan, the signs are very positive at the moment, noting that it was always a bit of a concern in the past years. He mentioned that in this case, it might just be a metric that shows that we are gradually coming back from the holidays. Quinlivan also added that he is not particularly worried about any FOMO, adding that it could also enter the market if Bitcoin surges to $92,000 quickly. Bitcoin is currently trading around $89,930 at the time of publication, up 1.77% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Quinlivan noted that a quick rise in Bitcoin’s price to reach this level will show the “true reaction from retailers.” “Are they starting to pour in money because they’re saying Bitcoin goes up? That would be bad,” he said. Retail euphoria in crypto markets has always pushed towards all-time highs or cycle peaks, and going by history, the market has dropped shortly after. In addition, analysts have previously argued that when the market excitement gets too intense, the crypto market has always moved in the opposite direction to what most people expect. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a metric that measures the overall crypto market sentiment, posted a “Fear” score of 29 in its Saturday update. The Index has been hovering around the “Fear” and “Extreme Fear” region since early November. Analysts predict a short-term rally for Bitcoin January has always been a historic month for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with average gains of 3.75% for BTC and 19.07% for ETH, according to data from CoinGlass. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan has reported that Bitcoin could face a difficult start to the new year after the premier asset gave back most of the gains it accrued in the past three months. The token dominated headlines in the early part of 2025, thanks to Donald Trump shining a light on it after taking back the White House. However, some analysts have added that they expect Bitcoin to undergo a rebound, even if the recovery will not last. Citi analyst Alex Saunders has mentioned that near-term support could come from the expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds, which will continue to provide better access to retail and institutional investors. He highlighted that the prediction assumes adoption will continue and ETF inflows would reach $15 billion, but noted that the level can only sustain the prices for a short while. Meanwhile, attention will remain on Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as another beacon for price movement. According to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the company’s enterprise-value-to-holdings ratio, which is above the 1.0 level, reassures the company that it would not consider selling its holdings during stress. “If this ratio stays above 1.0 and MicroStrategy can eventually avoid selling bitcoins, markets will likely be reassured, and the worst for bitcoin prices will likely be behind us,” Nikolaos said.

This data, captured on April 15, 2025, reveals a market in delicate balance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and regulatory developments affecting digital asset trading worldwide. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratio Analysis Perpetual futures represent one of cryptocurrency’s most innovative financial instruments, combining traditional futures mechanics with unique funding rate mechanisms. These derivatives maintain constant exposure without expiration dates, making their positioning data particularly valuable for sentiment analysis. The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio specifically measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions across exchanges. Market analysts consistently monitor this metric because it provides real-time insight into trader expectations and potential price direction biases. Exchange-specific data reveals subtle variations in trader behavior. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, reported a slight long bias at 50.02% long versus 49.98% short. Similarly, OKX showed marginally more bullish positioning at 50.07% long against 49.93% short. Bybit demonstrated the strongest long preference among the three platforms at 50.16% long compared to 49.84% short. These minor differences nevertheless indicate distinct trading community characteristics across platforms. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios (24-Hour Data) Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Overall Aggregate 49.85% 50.15% -0.30% (Slightly Bearish) Binance 50.02% 49.98% +0.04% (Neutral) OKX 50.07% 49.93% +0.14% (Slightly Bullish) Bybit 50.16% 49.84% +0.32% (Moderately Bullish) Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Dynamics Perpetual futures markets operate through sophisticated mechanisms that maintain contract prices close to underlying spot prices. The funding rate system automatically transfers payments between long and short position holders every eight hours, creating economic incentives for price convergence. When long positions dominate the market, funding rates typically turn positive, requiring longs to pay shorts. Conversely, excessive short positioning usually generates negative funding rates where shorts compensate longs. Current funding rates across major exchanges remain near neutral, reflecting the balanced positioning revealed in long-short ratio data. Several factors influence perpetual futures positioning beyond simple price expectations: Hedging Activity: Institutional traders often use perpetual futures to hedge spot Bitcoin holdings Leverage Preferences: Different exchanges offer varying maximum leverage levels affecting position sizing Geographic Distribution: Regional trading patterns create distinct positioning biases across platforms Market Making: Professional market makers maintain balanced books regardless of directional views Historical Context and Market Evolution Cryptocurrency derivatives markets have undergone substantial transformation since Bitcoin futures first launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the first regulated Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017, providing institutional investors with compliant exposure to cryptocurrency price movements. Subsequently, cryptocurrency-native exchanges developed perpetual futures products that gained tremendous popularity among retail and professional traders alike. Today, perpetual futures trading volume consistently exceeds spot trading volume across major cryptocurrency pairs, establishing derivatives as the dominant price discovery mechanism for digital assets. Historical long-short ratio data reveals distinct market phases. During the 2021 bull market, aggregate long positions frequently exceeded 60% across major exchanges, reflecting extreme bullish sentiment. Conversely, the 2022 bear market saw prolonged periods with short positions dominating above 55%. The current equilibrium around 50% represents a maturing market where participants exhibit more measured positioning. This development suggests increasing sophistication among cryptocurrency derivatives traders who now incorporate more nuanced risk management strategies. Exchange-Specific Positioning Analysis Each major cryptocurrency exchange maintains unique trader demographics and product features that influence perpetual futures positioning. Binance, as the global market leader, attracts the most diverse participant base including retail traders, institutions, and algorithmic trading firms. The platform’s near-perfect 50.02%/49.98% long-short split reflects this diversity, with opposing views effectively canceling each other out. Binance also offers the widest range of cryptocurrency perpetual futures products, allowing traders to express views across multiple digital assets beyond Bitcoin. OKX has historically maintained stronger retail trader participation in Asian markets, particularly throughout China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. The exchange’s 50.07%/49.93% ratio indicates slightly more bullish sentiment among this demographic, possibly reflecting regional economic conditions or local regulatory developments. OKX also pioneered several innovative derivatives features including unified margin accounts and portfolio margin systems that influence position management approaches. Bybit demonstrates the most pronounced long bias at 50.16%/49.84%, suggesting its user base maintains moderately optimistic Bitcoin price expectations. The exchange has cultivated strong popularity among retail derivatives traders through user-friendly interfaces, competitive fee structures, and extensive educational resources. Bybit’s consistent long bias throughout 2024 and early 2025 aligns with its marketing positioning as a platform for bullish cryptocurrency traders seeking leveraged exposure. Implications for Bitcoin Price Action Balanced perpetual futures positioning typically correlates with reduced short-term volatility as opposing forces create market stability. When extreme long or short positioning develops, markets become vulnerable to liquidation cascades where rapidly moving prices trigger automatic position closures. These liquidation events often accelerate price movements in the dominant direction, creating volatility spikes. The current equilibrium suggests reduced near-term liquidation risk, potentially supporting more orderly price discovery processes. Market structure analysis reveals additional insights when combining long-short ratio data with other metrics. Open interest, representing the total value of outstanding perpetual futures contracts, has remained stable throughout the reporting period. Funding rates across all three exchanges hover near 0.01% per eight-hour period, indicating neither longs nor shorts face significant carrying costs. Combined, these signals suggest a market in technical equilibrium where neither bulls nor bears possess clear advantage. Methodological Considerations in Ratio Calculation Long-short ratio calculations employ different methodologies across data providers, creating potential interpretation challenges. Some platforms calculate ratios based on position count, while others use position value or trader count. The data presented here utilizes position value methodology, measuring the notional value of long versus short positions. This approach provides the most accurate representation of capital allocation and market exposure. Several important limitations affect long-short ratio interpretation: Hidden Positions: Some institutional traders utilize multiple accounts or platforms obscuring true exposure Cross-Exchange Hedging: Sophisticated traders maintain offsetting positions across different venues Market Maker Activity: Liquidity providers typically maintain market-neutral books regardless of personal views Timeframe Discrepancies: Ratios represent snapshots rather than continuous measurements Despite these limitations, perpetual futures long-short ratios remain among the most widely monitored cryptocurrency market indicators. Trading platforms, analysts, and media outlets consistently reference this data when assessing market sentiment and potential price direction. The metric’s popularity stems from its simplicity, transparency, and real-time availability across multiple data providers. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio reveals a cryptocurrency derivatives market in remarkable equilibrium during the latest reporting period. With aggregate positioning nearly perfectly balanced at 49.85% long versus 50.15% short, traders appear divided on Bitcoin’s immediate direction despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Exchange-specific variations show subtle differences, with Bybit maintaining the strongest long bias at 50.16% while Binance exhibits near-perfect balance at 50.02% long. This balanced BTC perpetual futures positioning suggests reduced near-term volatility risk as opposing market forces create stability. Market participants will continue monitoring these ratios alongside funding rates and open interest for signals of developing directional biases in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio measure? The ratio measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specified exchanges. It provides insight into trader sentiment and potential price direction biases within derivatives markets. Q2: Why do long-short ratios differ across cryptocurrency exchanges? Ratios vary due to differences in trader demographics, geographic distribution, leverage offerings, and product features across platforms. Each exchange attracts distinct user bases with varying risk appetites and trading strategies. Q3: How does the long-short ratio relate to Bitcoin’s spot price movements? While not perfectly predictive, extreme positioning (above 55% either direction) often precedes increased volatility as liquidation cascades can accelerate price movements. Balanced ratios typically correlate with more stable price action. Q4: What time period does the long-short ratio data cover? The data represents a snapshot of open positions at a specific moment, typically updated continuously throughout trading sessions. The analysis above covers positions active during a 24-hour period ending at the reporting time. Q5: How should traders use long-short ratio information in their strategies? Sophisticated traders incorporate ratio data as one component of broader market analysis, combining it with funding rates, open interest, volume patterns, and technical indicators to assess market conditions and potential turning points.

Amid the cheers of the new year, the flagship cryptocurrency has once again retested the proven price resistance around $90,500, but the market still bears a sense of uncertainty. Related Reading: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner? Bitcoin Coinbase Premium To Rebound? In an X post on January 2, renowned analyst Burak Kesmeci shares an insightful analysis of the Bitcoin market following the asset’s positive start to 2026. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has gained by almost 4% since the new year commenced two days ago. Amid the mild market euphoria, Kesmeci highlights a simultaneous rise in Coinbase premiums across the Bitcoin and Ethereum market suggesting the recent price gains are significantly influenced by US investors. For context, the Coinbase premium assesses how much more or less US investors are paying for an asset. It is a strong market indicator as US investors’ liquidity tends to heavily influence the global market. Despite the latest price gains, Kesmeci notes that Coinbase premiums for BTC and ETH still remain negative, suggesting the majority of US investors still remain cautious. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Bitcoin Short-Term And Long-Term Triggers In predicting future price movements, Burak Kesmeci has also outlined some potential developments investors should watch out for. Using the simple moving average indicator, the market expert has identified certain price levels of importance to Bitcoin’s price trajectory. For a bullish trend to kick off in the short-term, Kesmeci explains that Bitcoin must maintain its current 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) above the present level at $89,415 for at least the next two days. Notably, a potential loss of this price level would suggest the present consolidation continues. Meanwhile, the seasoned analyst also expects a positive long-term trend to only develop when Bitcoin crosses above $101,000, which represents an intersection between the SMA365 and SMA111. This outlook underscores $101,000 as a major psychological and structural resistance, with a decisive break above it likely to restore Bitcoin’s bullish market structure after the extended correction observed in Q4 2025. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $89,520 following a 0.85% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 11471%, representing buoyant market activity. Notably, Bitcoin’s market cap has climbed to $1.79 trillion, allowing the maiden cryptocurrency account for 58.6% of the total crypto market cap.

The surge in bearish bets shows traders are bracing for losses after a fast jump in the stock that followed a $6 billion deal tied to energy and artificial intelligence. Shares of Trump Media climbed more than 30% after December 18, when the company said it would merge with Google-backed TAE Technologies in an all-stock transaction. The stock ran even harder right after the news, jumping as much as 63% over two trading days. Since Cryptopolitan reported the announcement, short interest has jumped 31% to nearly 16 million shares, close to the highest level seen since October. After the stock rose another 4% on Friday to $13.77, those short positions were worth about $218 million in bets that the price would fall, according to data from Yahoo Finance. Short sellers stack bets after merger sends Trump Media shares higher Trump Media is still losing money, and its shares are down almost 60% over the past 12 months even after the recent pop. Right now, President Donald Trump owns 115 million shares, about 40% of the company, but after the merger closes, his stake would drop to roughly 20%. Short interest near 16 million shares puts bearish positioning near levels last seen in October. The build came as the stock stayed volatile following the announcement. With the price still well below where it traded a year ago, some investors are betting the recent gains will not hold as the market absorbs the scale of the deal and the company’s ongoing losses. Trump Media’s token plan increases exposure as America goes pro-crypto At the same time, Trump Media said earlier this week it plans to issue a new token to shareholders, giving one token for each share held through a partnership with Crypto.com, and the token will operate on the Cronos blockchain. Trump later said on Truth that the token holders could receive rewards tied to its products. Chief executive Devin Nunes called the rollout “a first-of-its-kind token distribution” that will “reward Trump Media shareholders, and promote honest and open markets.” Devin also serves at the White House as chair of the Intelligence Advisory Board, where he advises the president on intelligence matters. The company said the tokens would be issued “in the near future.” Founded in 2021, Trump Media has expanded its push into crypto while also moving into artificial intelligence and financial services. Despite that expansion, its shares have fallen more than 60% this year. The crypto plan adds to Trump-linked ventures that have already generated hundreds of millions of dollars and allegations of conflicts of interest from Democrats in Congress and even some Republicans. Since returning to the White House in January, Donald has backed looser rules for crypto trading platforms and related businesses. The industry spent millions during the 2024 election cycle, backing candidates including him. Over the summer, he signed the country’s first major national crypto law, a step that folded crypto deeper into the financial system. Still, investor appetite has cooled this year as traders pulled away from volatile bets. Bitcoin is on track for an annual loss after sliding from record highs set in October. Some Trump-linked bets have stumbled too. The TRUMP meme coin surged ahead of the January inauguration and quickly ranked among the most valuable tokens. Since then, it has lost more than 90% of its value.

BTC Price Prediction and Why Investors Are Turning to This New Crypto Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-bottom-in-btc-price-prediction-and-why-investors-are-turning-to-this-new-crypto-instead/,cryptopolitan,"Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be holding steady, forming a new bottom, but whether it is merely taking a breather before resuming a downtrend is a matter of debate among analysts. Against this backdrop, investors are beginning to weigh the merits of potential up-and-coming cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently in Presale Stage 7 at the price of $0.04, is expected to present potential returns of even up to 1000% to those who join the presale today. This new crypto is attracting attention duet to its utility. The project’s presale, coupled with a lending and borrowing platform, planned multichain expansion, and the availability of convenient means of buying MUTM tokens using credit cards, may ultimately facilitate a 10x growth. When compared to the current state of Bitcoin (BTC) whose potential is limited by the sheer size of its market cap, MUTM presents a scenario where early buyers may enjoy more rapid appreciation prospects. For investors searching for the next big opportunity, this crypto to buy now offers compelling early-stage potential. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck below $91K, although technical levels indicate budding break-out momentum. The charts are tightening, MACD just turned green, and prices have held all three short-term averages while testing above the mid-band of Bollinger Bands, suggesting a market that is range-bound and not crashing. Additionally, resistance at $85K appears steadfast, and a clean close above $91K would provide a strong break-out. Until then, BTC is range-bound, underlining that trading in established markets remains difficult and that large gains prove tough in mature markets. Meanwhile, breakout investment opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly taking over the market. Mutuum Finance Is Still Early at $0.04 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in a position that could be considered in an early valuation stage in its ongoing presale. Being priced at $0.04 with a projected launch price of $0.06, smart buyers are getting in prior to the public who are waiting for launch. The project has managed to raise more than $19.52 million in the first 7 stages of presale, where more than 18,650 investors have participated. The current pricing is being regarded as early, since MUTM will launch at $0.06. This means stage 7 buyers get to benefit from a near 2x rise by the time of launch. In addition, the platform’s features support the potential for at least another 20x rise after market debut. This puts MUTM among this cycle’s most anticipated DeFi launches. While Bitcoin’s rally is limited by its huge market cap, MUTM offers untapped growth potential and smart investors are recognizing this opportunity. Passive Income for Users One of the major aspects of Mutuum Finance is the mtToken model, which encourages users to lend their assets by offering them incentives. While conventional assets can only earn interest when withdrawn, the mtTokens offered by Mutuum Finance guarantee the investors the chance to earn profits instantly while still having liquidity at their disposal. This has made MUTM the top crypto to buy now and a must-hold in 2026. Halborn Security Audit & Testnet Launch One of the most recent developments for the project was to have their lending and borrowing contracts reviewed independently by Halborn Security. The audit suggestions have been incorporated, and preparations are underway for Mutuum Finance V1 to debut on the Sepolia testnet, which will mark the first time it goes public. Some features that will be included in the testnet are: Liquidity Pools for Lending & Borrowing mtTokens signifying deposits and accumulated yields of users Debt tokens representing borrowed positions Automated liquidator bot for the management of under-collateralized loans At first, the ETH and USDT tokens will be the main assets to lend, borrow, and use as collateral within the system. More assets will be included later, with MUTM set for multichain integration. The testnet enables users to engage with the system and provide feedback to optimize the system before the mainnet launch. As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates below $91K, offering little upside in an established market, the chance presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in its early stage, is an uncommon occurrence. At the price of $0.04 during Presale Phase 7, with only $2,500 in, 62,500 MUTM tokens can be acquired, which can grow after presale to as much as $62,500, considering MUTM fetches $1 per piece. That’s a 25x ROI without having to lift a finger. Already, more than 18,650 investors are on board, and the project has raked in $19.52M, along with an exemplary mtToken model set to churn out passive income, offering realistic utility alongside the possibility for explosive growth.

The total losses resulting from wallet drainer phishing attacks reached $83.85 million, affecting 106,106 victims worldwide. According to Scan Sniffer’s 2025 phishing report, there was an 83% drop in stolen funds and a 68% reduction in victims compared with 2024, when phishing scams drained nearly half a billion dollars from more than 330,000 users. The Web3 security group said the reduction was likely a result of the mixed bullish and bearish market cycles last year, where phishing activity went up at peak market performances and fell when user engagement on blockchain networks dropped. Crypto market valuation declines ‘sends away’ phishing scammers Per Scam Sniffer’s analysis and chart data tracking the first quarter, when markets were declining, losses stood at $21.94 million, affecting slightly over 22,000 victims. When markets began to recover in the second quarter, phishing losses declined to $17.78 million from about 21,000 victims. Phishing losses and victims by month. Source: Scam Sniffer. The third quarter was the most dangerous period for market participants because several assets had witnessed strong rallies, including Bitcoin, which peaked at $123,000, and Ethereum, which hit its all-time-high price at $4,946 in August. The price charge and bull market environment came with a surge in phishing activity, pushing losses to $31.04 million and impacting 40,000 victims. August and September alone accounted for 29% of total annual losses, making the quarter the most active for attackers. However, the last quarter of the year saw a pullback in phishing losses that fell to $13.09 million, by far the quietest part of 2025. Permit / Permit2 leads signature phishing theft methods The biggest single phishing theft last year resulted in a $6.5 million loss in September, where hackers made away with staked ether and wrapped bitcoin derivatives. The attackers used a method known as the Permit-style signature, a feat that made up 38% of losses among cases exceeding $1 million. Permit/Permit 2 signatures allow token spending approvals without direct transfers, which attackers take advantage of by disguising malicious permissions to appear as legitimate prompts and trick token holders into accepting them without question. Other cases included a $3.13 million theft of wrapped Bitcoin in May using an approval escalation technique, and a $3.05 million loss of stablecoins in August through a direct transfer exploit. Yet, only 11 cases exceeded $1 million in the year, down from 30 the year before. The data also showed a decline in the average loss per victim, which fell to $790, down from nearly $1,500 last year. While the report focused on signature-based wallet drainer attacks, one of the most unforgettable cases occurred in February, when the Lazarus Group compromised a developer machine through a multisignature wallet provider within the Bybit crypto exchange. A malicious code was injected into a signing interface, enabling attackers to spoof legitimate approvals and steal approximately $1.46 billion. Supply chain attacks were also among the most prevalent methods used, with attackers stealing developer credentials through phishing emails and injecting malicious code into open-source packages, backdooring hundreds of software libraries, and exfiltrating private information and security credentials. Other campaigns phishing hackers used included compromised front-end interfaces, hijacked social media accounts, and spreading malware to steal private keys and authentication data. 2025 closed with Google Task notification phishing abuse In other news, the year ended with a sophisticated email phishing campaign in December, as hackers targeted more than 3,000 organizations in manufacturing by abusing Google’s cloud-based infrastructure. Several users reported receiving emails that appeared as genuine task notifications, prompting recipients to complete an urgent “All Employees Task.” Victims who clicked buttons labeled “View task” or “Mark complete” were redirected to malicious pages hosted on trusted cloud storage services. Because the messages were sent using legitimate application integration tools, they passed all major email authentication checks and walked past security gateways undetected.

At the same time, a separate BTC USDT chart comparison circulating on X argues Bitcoin now trades in a consolidation zone that resembles the late 2021 structure before the next leg higher. Long term Bitcoin holders pause selling after months of distribution Long term Bitcoin holders appear to have eased selling pressure for the first time since July 2025, based on a CryptoQuant chart shared on X by Merlijn The Trader. The chart tracks a 30 day sum of long term holder supply change, alongside Bitcoin’s price and the long term holder supply line. After months of mostly red bars, the latest readings move closer to neutral, which signals less net distribution than earlier in the period. Long term holder supply change 30 day sum. Source: CryptoQuant,Merlijn The Trader The histogram shows two clear regimes across 2025. First, green bars dominated into late June and early July, which points to net growth in long term holder supply during that stretch. Then, the chart flips into persistent red bars from mid July onward, indicating sustained net reductions as older coins moved out of long term holder status, sold, or transferred. Meanwhile, the long term holder supply line trends lower through the second half of the year, matching the extended red phase. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price line swings through several peaks and pullbacks, including a sharp drop around late November. Even so, the selling signal in the long term holder metric looks to be fading near year end as the red bars shrink. That shift matters because long term holder behavior often acts as a supply side filter. When long term holders sell, they add inventory to the market and can cap rebounds. However, when they slow distribution, the market can absorb fewer coins from that cohort, so price becomes more sensitive to changes in demand from spot buyers and derivatives positioning. Still, this metric alone does not confirm direction, since macro moves, liquidity, and short term holder activity can override the signal in the near term. Bitcoin chart highlights late 2021 style consolidation A Bitcoin price chart shared on X compares the 2024–2026 BTC USDT structure with the 2020–2022 cycle, focusing on a sideways phase near a key horizontal level. The post came from Vivek Sen, who argued the setup supports a move toward $280,000. Bitcoin USDT cycle comparison chart 2024–2026 and 2020–2022. Source: Vivek Sen In the 2024–2026 panel, Bitcoin climbs, then trades in a tight range around the marked support line, with the chart labeling the consolidation area as November 2025. The earlier part of the move shows a downtrend break and recovery into the current range, which frames the market as holding above a reclaimed level rather than extending in a straight line. In the 2020–2022 panel, the chart marks a similar pause around November 2021 after an advance, followed by a strong continuation higher. The comparison implies the market can spend time building a base near prior resistance before the next leg. The chart also includes a dashed path projecting higher into 2026. However, it provides no timing signals or triggers beyond the idea that price needs to hold the highlighted zone. As a result, the takeaway is structural: Bitcoin sits in consolidation near support, and the bullish projection depends on that base staying intact while demand returns.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

According to reports, the attackers have been draining wallets years after encrypted vaults were stolen and laundering the digital assets through Russian exchanges. In 2022, LastPass confirmed that attackers had breached its systems by compromising a developer environment. The platform added that the criminals stole portions of the company’s source code and proprietary technical information. In another related incident, the hackers used the stolen credentials to breach the GoTo cloud storage firm, stealing LastPass database backups stored on the platform. For some users, the vault contained both stored credentials and cryptocurrency wallet private keys and seed phrases. Cryptocurrency theft attacks linked to LastPass breach During the breach, LastPass claimed that its vaults were encrypted. However, users with weak or reused master passwords were vulnerable to offline cracking, which TRM Labs believes has been ongoing since the breach occurred. “Depending on the length and complexity of your master password and iteration count setting, you may want to reset your master password,” warned LastPass when they disclosed the breach. The link between the LastPass breaches and the cryptocurrency thefts was also confirmed by the United States Secret Service last year after the agency seized more than $23 million in crypto and said the attackers had obtained the private keys of their victims by decrypting vault data stolen in a password manager breach. Court filings also mentioned that there was no evidence that the victims’ devices had been compromised through malware or phishing. In its report, TRM Labs connected the ongoing crypto theft to the abuse of the encrypted LastPass vaults stolen in 2022. Rather than the hackers moving swiftly to drain the entire wallets after the breach, the thefts have been carried out in waves, months or years after the incident occurred. It also shows that attackers have been gradually decrypting vaults and extracting stored credentials. In addition, the wallets were drained using similar transaction methods. TRM Labs also mentioned that the method used during the breach showed that the hackers possessed the private keys before the thefts. “The linkage in the report is not based on direct attribution to individual LastPass accounts, but on correlating downstream on-chain activity with the known impact pattern of the 2022 breach,” TRM said. The platform noted that it created a scenario in which the wallet occurs in the future, rather than immediately after the breach happened. TRM Labs highlights the use of Wasabi’s CoinJoin feature The platform also mentioned that its research was initially based on a small number of reports, including several submissions made to Chainabuse, where users identified the LastPass breach as the method the hackers used to steal their wallets. The researchers increased their investigation, identifying cryptocurrency transaction behavior across other cases, eventually linking it to the data theft campaign. TRM also added that it was able to trace funds even after the attackers mixed them using Wasabi wallet’s CoinJoin feature. CoinJoin is a Bitcoin privacy technique that includes all transactions from multiple users into a single transaction, making it harder to determine which input corresponds to which output. The feature obfuscates transactions without using a traditional mixing service. After draining wallets , the hackers usually convert stolen assets to Bitcoin, route them through Wasabi Wallet, and attempt to hide their tracks using the feature. However, TRM mentioned that it was able to demix the Bitcoin sent using the CoinJoin feature by analyzing behavioral characteristics, such as transaction structure, timing, and wallet configuration choices. It was also able to match deposits with withdrawal patterns that matched the crypto theft.

This comprehensive analysis examines BTC’s potential price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, incorporating historical patterns, technological developments, and macroeconomic factors that could influence the world’s premier cryptocurrency. Market analysts particularly focus on post-halving cycles and increasing mainstream integration. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Professional analysts employ multiple methodologies when forecasting Bitcoin’s future value. Quantitative models often reference stock-to-flow ratios, network effect metrics, and adoption curve projections. Historical data reveals Bitcoin has experienced four-year cycles typically aligned with halving events. The 2024 halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, creating predictable supply constraints. Furthermore, increasing institutional participation through spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced new capital flows. Traditional financial institutions now allocate portions of portfolios to digital assets. This institutional validation represents a significant shift from Bitcoin’s early years as a purely retail-driven asset. Technical and Fundamental Analysis Framework Analysts combine on-chain metrics with macroeconomic indicators for balanced predictions. Key metrics include: Network Hash Rate: Measures computational security and miner commitment Active Addresses: Indicates user adoption and network utility Exchange Reserves: Tracks available supply versus long-term holding patterns MVRV Ratio: Compares market value to realized value for valuation insights These indicators provide objective data points beyond speculative sentiment. The growing Lightning Network capacity additionally suggests improving scalability for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Post-Halving Momentum Analysis Historical patterns suggest 2026 could represent a period of consolidation or continued growth following the 2024 halving. Previous cycles indicate the second year post-halving often shows substantial price appreciation. However, analysts caution that past performance never guarantees future results. Several factors specifically influence 2026 projections: Factor Potential Impact Evidence Source Institutional ETF Flows Continued capital inflow SEC regulatory approvals Global Regulatory Clarity Reduced uncertainty premium MiCA implementation in EU Technological Scaling Improved utility and adoption Taproot adoption metrics Market observers note that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional assets has fluctuated. During periods of monetary policy uncertainty, Bitcoin sometimes behaves as a risk-off asset. This evolving relationship complicates straightforward predictions. Central bank digital currency developments may also influence Bitcoin’s perceived role in the global financial system. BTC 2030 Forecast: Long-Term Value Proposition Projecting to 2030 requires examining Bitcoin’s fundamental value drivers. The fixed supply of 21 million coins creates predictable scarcity. By 2030, approximately 98% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. This diminishing new supply coincides with potential increased demand scenarios. Several adoption trajectories could materialize: Store of Value Narrative: Continued adoption as digital gold Medium of Exchange Development: Improved scalability enabling transactions Institutional Infrastructure: Integration with traditional finance deepening Demographic trends favor increased cryptocurrency adoption. Younger generations show greater comfort with digital assets. Technological improvements in custody solutions and user interfaces could lower barriers to entry. However, regulatory developments across major economies will significantly influence adoption rates. International coordination efforts through organizations like the Financial Stability Board may establish clearer global standards. Expert Perspectives and Model Variations Financial institutions have published varied Bitcoin price predictions for 2030. These projections typically range from conservative to optimistic based on different adoption scenarios. Goldman Sachs analysts emphasize Bitcoin’s volatility but acknowledge its growing institutional acceptance. Meanwhile, Fidelity Investments researchers highlight Bitcoin’s unique characteristics as an uncorrelated asset. Academic institutions like MIT and Stanford regularly publish blockchain research that informs these forecasts. It’s crucial to understand that all long-term predictions involve significant uncertainty. Market participants should consider multiple scenarios rather than single price targets. Critical Market Factors Influencing Future Bitcoin Valuation Several interconnected elements will determine Bitcoin’s price trajectory through 2030. Monetary policy decisions by major central banks significantly impact all risk assets. Interest rate environments influence the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Geopolitical developments affecting currency stability may increase demand for decentralized alternatives. Technological advancements in competing blockchain networks could affect Bitcoin’s market dominance. Environmental concerns regarding energy consumption continue prompting innovation in mining sustainability. The transition toward renewable energy sources for mining operations may address these concerns. Additionally, security developments protecting against quantum computing threats remain an ongoing research priority for the Bitcoin development community. Comparative Asset Analysis Bitcoin increasingly competes with traditional stores of value. Gold maintains a market capitalization exceeding $13 trillion, while Bitcoin’s market capitalization fluctuates around $1 trillion. This comparison suggests substantial growth potential if Bitcoin captures even a portion of gold’s market. Real estate and bond markets offer alternative investment vehicles with different risk-return profiles. Bitcoin’s 24/7 market operation provides unique liquidity advantages over traditional assets with limited trading hours. However, this constant availability also contributes to volatility. The evolving regulatory treatment of Bitcoin as either a commodity or security will affect its investment characteristics and tax treatment across jurisdictions. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 involve analyzing complex technological, economic, and regulatory factors. While historical patterns and quantitative models provide frameworks, unexpected developments frequently disrupt financial markets. The Bitcoin price prediction landscape requires continuous monitoring of on-chain metrics, institutional adoption rates, and global macroeconomic conditions. Investors should maintain balanced perspectives, recognizing both Bitcoin’s transformative potential and its inherent volatility. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, Bitcoin’s role within global finance will likely continue evolving alongside technological advancements and regulatory developments. FAQs Q1: What is the most reliable method for Bitcoin price prediction? Analysts typically combine multiple methodologies including technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and fundamental factors. No single method proves completely reliable, so consensus among varied approaches provides the most balanced outlook. Q2: How does Bitcoin halving affect long-term price predictions? Halving events reduce new Bitcoin supply by 50% approximately every four years. Historical data shows these events have preceded substantial price increases, though each cycle exhibits unique characteristics influenced by broader market conditions. Q3: What percentage of institutional portfolios currently includes Bitcoin? Allocations remain small but growing. Recent surveys indicate between 1-5% of portfolio allocations among crypto-adopting institutions, with many traditional firms still in exploratory phases regarding digital asset integration. Q4: How do regulatory developments impact Bitcoin price predictions? Clear regulatory frameworks typically reduce uncertainty premiums and may increase institutional participation. However, restrictive regulations in major economies could limit adoption rates and affect price trajectories significantly. Q5: What technological developments could most influence Bitcoin’s price by 2030? Scalability solutions like the Lightning Network, improved privacy features, quantum-resistant cryptography, and enhanced smart contract capabilities through layers could substantially increase Bitcoin’s utility and adoption.

The Hong Kong tech company has already acquired various mining hardware from Bitmain to mine Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Its mining fleet comprises Antminer S21 XP Hydro units, S21 XP air-cooled miners, and Antminer L9 machines, which are expected to provide 30 PH/s for Bitcoin and 0.5 TH/s for Litecoin and Dogecoin. All installations are expected to be completed by the end of this month. It also secured 0.5 megawatts of power capacity across several US data centers . Not to mention, the firm is preparing to scale into broader digital assets activities, including future staking and node services, describing the start of its mining operation as a launchpad for its future services. BitVentures plans to expand crypto operations in the years to come BitVentures expects full mining deployment in the first quarter, targeting Bitcoin and select altcoins while prioritizing efficient, high-end machines to manage market fluctuations. Lawrence Wai Lok, CEO of the company, has described the rollout as a proof-of-concept phase, adding that the company will gradually expand its operations over time. He commented, “Subject to ongoing market conditions, the company intends to continue to invest in digital assets, and methodically scale its operations in tranches, creating a foundation for future expansion into broader digital asset services, including potential staking, node operations, and ecosystem partnerships.” He added, “We believe that establishing an efficient mining footprint may position the company favorably to pursue broader opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem.” Previously, BitVentures was formerly known as Santech Holdings and was listed on Nasdaq as STEC. The name change and ticker symbol change to BVC took effect on December 24. Before then, Santech’s core business had focused on technology investments, e-commerce platforms, and consumer-facing digital services, with no direct ties to blockchain or cryptocurrency. The firm had noted in its rebranding filing, “The company believes that the new name aligns well with its vision and focus on developing and investing in early-stage technology ventures.” Before switching to the Santech name, it was Hywin Wealth, a leading independent wealth management firm in China and a major player in real estate investment products. Over the past few months, several listed companies — including BitVentures — have turned to digital assets, raising crypto exposure as a potential remedy for business slowdowns and falling valuations. Last summer, biotech company 180 Life Sciences switched to an Ethereum treasury strategy after its shares had lost around 99% of their value. Corporations across all sectors, from non-bank lending to consumer products and agri-tech, have turned their attention to digital asset treasury strategies, such as those employed by Mill City Ventures, Upexi, and Nature’s Miracle. BitVentures shares surged 8% after it revealed its plans BitVentures’ stock has tumbled, with total returns since its IPO at approximately -89%, according to reports, a factor that may explain the company’s pivot. Stepping away from its wealth and asset management divisions resulted in the company generating no revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025. Nonetheless, BitVentures’ stock recorded a significant 8%+ increase in intraday trading after the firm announced its strategic move into the digital assets space, indicating a notable shift in its business strategy. The surge in share price came as investors increasingly bought into the company’s new bets in the cryptocurrency mining and broader blockchain-related services category — a portion of the tech industry that many investors see as high-growth, high-demand, and promising in the future.

Buyers continue to defend the $88,000–$88,500 zone, while momentum remains restrained. Technical structure points to compression, not weakness, with higher lows, stabilizing indicators, and cautious sentiment shaping the outlook. Whether Bitcoin breaks above $90,500 or revisits lower support will likely set the tone for its next major move. Why Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Is Continuing to Defy the Odds Recent price action points to a clear stalemate. December’s volatility may have grabbed headlines, but Bitcoin has since settled into a tighter range, forming higher lows while struggling to reclaim the upper $90,000s. #Bitcoin is starting 2026 at a crossroads. #BTC holds near $89.7K as buyers defend $88K support, volatility compresses, and RSI stabilizes. A break above $90.5K could unlock the next leg higher — or delay the move. pic.twitter.com/i4JltTfeYW — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) January 3, 2026 This price behavior reflects consolidation rather than weakness, at least based on current market data. After a turbulent December, profit-taking has cooled, while long-term holders appear comfortable maintaining exposure rather than rushing for the exit. Candlestick behavior supports this interpretation. Smaller candle bodies and shorter wicks suggest neither buyers nor sellers are pressing aggressively. There are no clear signs of bearish follow-through or panic-driven selling, reinforcing the view that the market is pausing rather than breaking down. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis: What’s the End Game? On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish after the breakout of remains a symmetrical triangle pattern which was defined by lower highs near $93,500 and a rising base between $85,800 and $87,000. This pattern typically signals compression and often precedes a volatility expansion rather than a sustained decline. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview So what is the current technical setup telling us? The constructive takeaway is that key indicators continue to lean supportive: Bitcoin is still printing higher lows along an ascending trendline drawn from mid-December, reinforcing underlying demand. The 50-day and 100-day EMAs are flattening and clustering around the $88,500–$89,000 area, creating a near-term support cushion. RSI has stabilized in the low-to-mid 60s, indicating improving momentum without entering overheated territory. There is no bearish divergence or negative EMA crossover in place, keeping downside risk contained for now. Market Data Adds to the Picture Looking beyond the charts, broader market metrics reinforce the technical setup. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization has rebounded toward $3 trillion, while 24-hour trading volume sits near $116 billion. That combination points to active participation without the kind of excess typically seen near market tops. Sentiment indicators also remain measured. The Fear and Greed Index continues to signal caution, reflecting lingering uncertainty rather than speculative euphoria, an environment that often leaves room for upside if price breaks key technical levels. What to Expect from Bitcoin in the Coming Weeks From a 2-hour chart perspective, a confirmed close above the $90,500–$90,900 zone would likely open the door to a push toward $93,500, with scope to extend into the $96,000–$97,000 area if momentum builds. Conversely, a failure to hold the upper $80,000s would weaken the structure and bring the $85,800 support level back into focus. At this stage, the price action looks more like preparation than exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin continues to defend the high $80,000s, the underlying bias remains constructive. A decisive breakout could shift sentiment quickly and potentially mark the start of the market’s next advance as the broader crypto cycle moves into a new phase. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

56765916,652135,1767434450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56765916.jpeg,Michael Saylor’s Strategy Anticipated To Disclose ‘Multibillion-Dollar’ Loss In Q4 Report,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-to-disclose-multibillion-dollar-loss/,bitcoinist,"Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is poised for one of its toughest year-end closings to date, as Bitcoin (BTC) prices have retraced below the $90,000 mark from highs exceeding $126,000. This downturn is expected to culminate in a multibillion-dollar loss when the firm releases its fourth-quarter financial results. Strategy’s Earnings Expected To Plunge According to reports from Bloomberg, Strategy is likely to announce substantial losses that represent a stark contrast to the $2.8 billion profit recorded in the previous third-quarter of the last year. Aaron Jacob, an associate professor at Brigham Young University and a senior adviser at Taxbit, noted the significance of this shift, stating, “There was this one-time pop, but that is a different story in this quarter. It is going to be a sizable loss.” The root of this anticipated loss can be traced back to an accounting change implemented in the first quarter of the year, requiring the company to value its cryptocurrency assets at current market prices. Given that Bitcoin tumbled 24% during the fourth quarter, the impact of this decision is now becoming evident. Following a period of strong performance against benchmark stock indices, the company’s shares have fallen nearly 48% throughout 2025, down to its current trading price of $156. Saylor’s Wealth Plummets 40% Concerns have also emerged that Strategy may need to sell portions of its Bitcoin holdings to cover mounting expenses, including dividends and interest payments. To mitigate these apprehensions, Strategy established a cash reserve on December 1 by selling common shares. Strategy also revised its full-year earnings guidance at the beginning of last month. The company is operating under the assumption that Bitcoin will range between $85,000 and $110,000 by year-end. Based on these projections, it anticipated operating income could range from a loss of $7 billion to a profit of $9.5 billion. However, with Bitcoin finishing the year down 6.5%, the likelihood leans toward a loss closer to the lower end of that spectrum. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the company’s co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylor , has also suffered a dramatic drop in personal wealth during this downturn, with his fortune falling by around 40% to approximately $3.8 billion. Market-To-Net Asset Value Drops To Critical Levels As if to compound the company’s challenges, Strategy now faces a potential decline in investor confidence. The enterprise value of the firm is nearing a level that could fall below the value of its Bitcoin holdings for the first time in over two years. Current data suggests the company’s enterprise value—including its debts and the total notional value of its perpetual preferred stock—stands at approximately $61 billion. With shares down nearly 70% from the record high reached in November 2024, the company’s market-to-net asset value (mNAV)—a ratio comparing market capitalization and debt to token holdings—has dropped to just above 1.

Bitfinex Hack Mastermind Receives Early Release On Friday, Ilya Lichtenstein, the mastermind behind the 2016 hack that stole over 120,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from crypto exchange Bitfinex, announced that he had been released from prison a year after receiving a five-year sentence . On X, Lichtenstein thanked a law signed by President Trump during his first administration for his release. “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early,” the post stated. Notably, Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act on December 21, 2018, aiming to improve criminal justice outcomes and reduce the size of the federal prison population. The law included a series of reforms, including one to establish a “risk and needs assessment system” that offers some inmates rehabilitative programming and the opportunity to be released early into home confinement. According to CNBC, A Trump administration official stated on January 2 that the mastermind behind the Bitfinex hack “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” The US Department of Justice (DOJ) previously declared that Lichtenstein used advanced hacking techniques and tools to access Bitfinex’s network. He then transferred 119,574 Bitcoin to one of his crypto wallets through more than 2,000 transactions. At the time, the stolen funds were valued at around $71 million. However, its value has increased exponentially in the past decade, being worth nearly $11 billion at current prices. During his sentencing hearing, he expressed remorse for using his talents on criminal activities “instead of a positive contribution to society.” “I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,” Lichtenstein affirmed on his Friday announcement, thanking his supporters for the help and vowing to prove “the haters” wrong. Crypto Heist Figures Reunite Under Trump’s Law Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, reacted to the news online, declaring that being reunited at home with her husband after four years was “the best New Year’s present” she could get. Morgan, a rapper known online as “Razzlekhan,” entered prison in February 2025 but was released early from prison after eight months under the First Step Act. In late October, she posted a video on X, sharing the news and thanking President Trump for her release. “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter,” she stated . However, it appears that the US President was not directly involved in the decision. As reported by Bitcoinist, the self-titled “Crocodile of Wall Street” was sentenced to 18 months in prison on November 18, 2024, for her role in the Bitfinex heist. Despite not being involved in the hack, Morgan assisted her husband in laundering the stolen funds by using “numerous sophisticated laundering techniques” to disguise them. Notably, they used fake identities to create online accounts, deposited the stolen Bitcoin in several darknet markets and crypto exchanges to withdraw the funds, converted BTC to other cryptocurrencies, and deposited part of the funds into crypto mixers. The couple seemingly managed to launder 21% of the total funds stolen from Bitfinex. At the time, prosecutors argued that Morgan was “a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions.” Nonetheless, they noted that she was “a lower-level participant,” which resulted in her reduced sentence.",Crypto News|2016 Bitfinex Hack|bitcoin|Bitcoin Heist|Bitfinex exchange|Bitfinex Hacker|btc|BTCUSDFT|crypto hacker|Crypto heist|heather Morgan|Ilya Lichtenstein|US President Donald Trump,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,0,0,EN,"{

This sudden downturn followed breaking news reports of a targeted U.S. military airstrike in Venezuela, immediately highlighting the digital asset’s ongoing sensitivity to real-world geopolitical shocks. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing whether this represents a fleeting reaction or the start of a deeper correction amidst a complex macroeconomic landscape. Bitcoin Price Reacts to Sudden Geopolitical Shock According to data from major exchanges and reported by Cointelegraph, the leading cryptocurrency reversed from an intraday high near $90,940. The sell-off accelerated rapidly as news wires confirmed the Venezuelan incident. Market depth charts showed significant short-term selling pressure materializing in the wake of the headlines. This event provides a stark, real-time case study in market microstructure. High-frequency traders and algorithmic systems often execute pre-programmed risk-off protocols during such events. Historically, Bitcoin and other crypto assets have demonstrated pronounced volatility during geopolitical crises. For instance, the initial phases of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict saw similar sharp declines followed by a vigorous recovery. The current situation mirrors that pattern, where initial fear-driven selling gives way to more nuanced trading based on the conflict’s perceived duration and global economic impact. Market participants are now closely monitoring official statements from Washington D.C. and Caracas for further clues. Analyst Consensus and Short-Term Market Pressure Many prominent market analysts believe the Bitcoin price drop will likely prove temporary, contingent on the situation not escalating into a broader regional conflict. “Geopolitical events often create knee-jerk liquidity crunches in digital asset markets,” noted a strategist from a major crypto investment firm. “The underlying network fundamentals for Bitcoin remain unchanged. However, if the situation stabilizes, we typically see a retracement of the initial panic move.” This perspective is supported by on-chain data, which showed no corresponding spike in long-term holder distribution during the sell-off. Evidence from Derivatives and On-Chain Metrics Data from derivatives markets offers further context. The funding rates for Bitcoin perpetual swaps turned slightly negative, indicating heightened caution among leveraged traders. Meanwhile, the futures open interest declined modestly, suggesting a unwind of speculative positions rather than a fundamental exodus. The following table summarizes key market metrics before and after the news broke: Metric Pre-News (Approx.) Post-News (Approx.) BTC Spot Price $90,940 $89,850 24h Trading Volume Change +15% +85% Fear & Greed Index Greed (72) Neutral (54) BTC Dominance 52.1% 51.8% This data illustrates a classic risk-off shift. The surge in volume confirms the news was the primary catalyst, while the shift in market sentiment indices reflects a sudden reassessment of risk. The Broader Context: Capital Rotation and Macro Trends The event occurs against a fascinating macroeconomic backdrop. Notably, gold—the traditional safe-haven asset—has been correcting after recently hitting a nominal all-time high. In contrast, Bitcoin had risen approximately 5% since the Christmas holiday period. This divergent performance has fueled analyst speculation about a potential capital rotation from traditional stores of value into digital assets. The theory suggests investors may be reallocating a portion of their inflation-hedge portfolios. Several factors support this observation. First, increasing institutional adoption provides a structural bid for Bitcoin. Second, its fixed supply schedule contrasts with the continuous mining of precious metals. Finally, its digital, borderless nature offers a unique value proposition in times of regional instability. However, today’s price action serves as a crucial reminder that Bitcoin’s journey to becoming a uncorrelated safe haven remains a work in progress. Its price discovery is still heavily influenced by global liquidity conditions and investor sentiment. Historical Precedents and Market Psychology Examining past reactions provides critical insight. During the 2020 U.S.-Iran tensions, Bitcoin initially sold off before rallying strongly in the subsequent weeks. The market often processes geopolitical risk in two phases: an initial liquidity shock where all risky assets are sold, followed by a reassessment phase where assets with strong underlying theses recover. The speed of Bitcoin’s recovery this time will be a key indicator of its maturity. Long-term holders, often called ‘HODLers,’ typically view these dips as accumulation opportunities, which can create a price floor. Conclusion The sudden drop in the Bitcoin price below $90,000 following the Venezuela airstrike news underscores the cryptocurrency market’s acute sensitivity to geopolitical developments. While analysts largely view the sell-off as a temporary reaction to a risk-off shock, it vividly illustrates the asset class’s current stage of evolution. The concurrent narrative of potential capital rotation from gold to BTC adds a complex, longer-term dimension to the short-term volatility. Ultimately, the market’s response in the coming days will offer valuable evidence on Bitcoin’s resilience and its evolving role within the global financial ecosystem during periods of international tension. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall after the Venezuela airstrike news? Financial markets often react negatively to sudden geopolitical instability due to increased uncertainty. The news triggered automated and discretionary selling as investors sought to reduce risk exposure, causing a short-term liquidity shock in the cryptocurrency market. Q2: How does this reaction compare to Bitcoin’s behavior in past geopolitical crises? The pattern is consistent with previous events, such as the early 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Typically, an initial sharp sell-off on the news is followed by a period of consolidation and often a recovery, depending on the scale and duration of the crisis. Q3: What is meant by ‘capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin’? This theory suggests that some investors are moving funds out of traditional safe-haven assets like gold, which has recently corrected from highs, and into Bitcoin. The 5% rise in BTC since Christmas amidst gold’s correction is cited as preliminary evidence, though long-term trends require more data. Q4: Will the Bitcoin price drop continue? Most analysts cited believe the drop will be temporary if the Venezuela situation does not escalate significantly. Market recovery will depend on the evolution of the geopolitical event, broader macroeconomic conditions, and underlying on-chain Bitcoin network strength. Q5: What metrics should investors watch now? Key metrics include the stability of the Venezuela situation, Bitcoin’s on-chain exchange flows (to see if long-term holders are selling), derivatives market funding rates, and the price action of traditional safe havens like gold and the U.S. dollar.

Venezuelan authorities accused Washington of hitting military-linked targets and announced emergency security measures after the blasts. U.S. President Donald Trump later said Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and flown out of the country following the operation. At the time of reporting, officials did not publish a detailed briefing that confirmed targets, timing, or the claim’s operational details. Airspace warnings and flight restrictions also surfaced in early coverage. As a result, traders treated the headlines as an immediate macro risk event, even while many facts remained unsettled. Bolivar Weakness and Dollar Pricing Fueled USDT Demand Venezuela entered the latest shock with a fragile currency setup. The Venezuelan bolívar has faced repeated depreciation pressure, while many merchants price goods in U.S. dollars to avoid fast-changing local costs. USD/VES Exchange Rate Trend. Source: Trading Economics That gap creates a daily conversion problem. People often earn or hold bolívars, yet they need dollars for rent, imports, and bigger purchases, so exchange rates matter even for routine spending. In that environment, USDT has expanded as a “digital dollar” substitute for transfers and short-term savings. When cash USD gets scarce or risky to move, USDT can act as a bridge between bolívars and dollar-based pricing, including for business payments. Bitcoin Price Mirrors Israel–Iran Headline Volatility Bitcoin traded in a wide intraday range on Jan. 3, and the chart shows sharp swings instead of a one-way move. Price fell toward $88,600 in the late afternoon, then it rebounded fast and pushed above $90,500 in the evening. After that spike, Bitcoin drifted lower in choppy trading, and it later dipped again near $89,400 before stabilizing around $89,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Intraday Price Chart (Jan. 3).

56766490,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258263,1767439211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-caroline-crenshaw-resigns-crypto/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a move that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a steadfast Democratic voice for stringent cryptocurrency oversight, has announced her resignation from the agency. Her departure, first reported by DL News, removes a pivotal figure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and sparks immediate analysis about the future direction of crypto policy. Crenshaw consistently championed a strict application of securities laws to the burgeoning industry, most notably dissenting against the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Consequently, her exit introduces significant uncertainty and potential for a more industry-friendly regulatory posture from the nation’s top financial markets watchdog. Caroline Crenshaw’s Legacy as an SEC Crypto Critic President Joe Biden appointed Caroline Crenshaw to the SEC in 2020. She quickly established herself as the commission’s most vocal skeptic regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. Her regulatory philosophy centered on robust investor protection and market integrity. Crenshaw frequently argued that many digital assets constitute securities under existing law. She believed they should therefore comply with the full suite of registration and disclosure requirements. This stance often placed her at odds with industry advocates seeking new, tailored frameworks. Her tenure featured several high-profile dissents and public statements. These documents now form a clear record of her cautious approach. For instance, she voiced deep concerns about the custody, valuation, and market manipulation risks inherent in crypto markets. Furthermore, Crenshaw emphasized the potential for retail investor harm in a volatile and complex asset class. Her consistent messaging provided a counterbalance to more permissive views, both within the SEC and in the broader political arena. A Defining Moment: The Bitcoin ETF Dissent Commissioner Crenshaw’s most significant public stand occurred in January 2024. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, approved a batch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This decision marked a historic pivot after years of rejections. However, Crenshaw issued a forceful and detailed dissent. She argued the approvals failed to adequately address fundamental concerns about fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin spot markets. Crenshaw warned that the decision could expose millions of investors to substantial risks. This dissent cemented her reputation as the commission’s foremost crypto critic and highlighted the deep internal divisions on the issue. The Immediate Impact of the Resignation on Crypto Regulation Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation creates an immediate vacancy on the five-member commission. The SEC’s current composition now leans more heavily toward perspectives that may be open to engaging with the digital asset sector. However, Chair Gary Gensler remains a central figure. His own enforcement-focused approach will continue to guide the agency’s day-to-day operations. The immediate impact may be more tonal than substantive in the short term. Nevertheless, her absence removes a powerful internal voice advocating for the strictest possible interpretation of the law. The resignation process triggers a political appointment sequence. President Biden will nominate a successor, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. This process offers a key opportunity to shift the commission’s balance. Industry groups will likely lobby for a nominee with a more nuanced understanding of blockchain technology. Conversely, investor protection advocates will push for someone who maintains Crenshaw’s vigilance. The timeline for this appointment remains uncertain, creating a period of regulatory ambiguity. Potential Shifts in Pending Enforcement and Rulemaking Analysts are scrutinizing several ongoing SEC initiatives for potential change. High-profile enforcement cases against major crypto exchanges, which Crenshaw likely supported, will probably continue. However, her departure could influence the commission’s appetite for future, expansive legal theories. In terms of rulemaking, key areas to watch include: Custody Rules: Proposed changes to how investment advisers custody digital assets. Exchange Definitions: Rules that could expand the definition of an “exchange” to include DeFi platforms. Staking Services: Regulatory clarity for crypto staking and lending products. Without Crenshaw’s vote, proposals in these areas might see modifications or face closer votes, potentially leading to more industry-favorable outcomes. Historical Context and the Broader Regulatory Battle Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation occurs during a pivotal decade for financial regulation. The rise of blockchain technology has challenged decades-old legal frameworks globally. In the United States, the debate centers on whether existing securities laws, largely written in the 1930s, can effectively govern this new asset class. The SEC, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, has generally argued they can. Crenshaw was a leading proponent of this view. Her stance contrasted with other regulators, like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has sought greater authority over digital commodities. This internal SEC dynamic mirrors a larger conflict in Washington. Legislative efforts to create a comprehensive crypto framework have repeatedly stalled in Congress. In the absence of new laws, regulatory agencies like the SEC have used enforcement actions to establish boundaries. Crenshaw’s voice was crucial in shaping that enforcement-first strategy. Her exit may encourage renewed legislative negotiations, as industry players see an opening for a more collaborative regulatory partner. Expert Analysis on the Commission’s Future Direction Financial law experts emphasize that one commissioner’s departure does not instantly reverse policy. “Commissioner Crenshaw was an important intellectual force for caution,” notes a former SEC senior counsel. “Her dissents provided a roadmap for legal challenges to SEC actions perceived as too lenient. Without that voice, the internal debate may lack a certain rigor, potentially allowing for more pragmatic, though still regulated, approaches to emerge.” Other analysts point to the remaining commissioners’ public statements. They suggest a continued focus on enforcement but perhaps with more publicly stated distinctions between different types of crypto assets. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the SEC and Crypto The resignation of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw marks the end of a definitive era in U.S. cryptocurrency regulation. Her unwavering advocacy for applying traditional securities laws with full force provided a clear, if contentious, regulatory stance. Her departure introduces a new variable into an already complex equation. While immediate, sweeping changes are unlikely, the long-term trajectory of SEC policy toward digital assets may now have greater flexibility. The focus now shifts to the White House and the Senate. The appointment of her successor will send the next clear signal about whether the SEC under Chair Gensler will maintain its hardline posture or begin a cautious pivot toward a more structured engagement with the crypto industry. The legacy of Caroline Crenshaw’s tenure will be measured by how that future unfolds. FAQs Q1: Why did Caroline Crenshaw resign from the SEC? Commissioner Crenshaw has not publicly stated a specific reason for her resignation. Such departures are common at the end of a term or for personal career progression. The announcement, reported by DL News, simply confirms her decision to leave the agency. Q2: Does her resignation mean the SEC will stop suing crypto companies? No. The SEC’s enforcement division operates independently and pursues cases it believes violate securities laws. Chair Gary Gensler, who leads the agency, remains in place and has consistently supported an active enforcement stance. Crenshaw’s departure may affect the commission’s vote on certain cases but is unlikely to halt enforcement altogether. Q3: Who will replace Caroline Crenshaw on the SEC? President Biden will nominate a successor. The nominee must then be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The process could take several months. The new commissioner will likely be a Democrat, maintaining the current 3-2 partisan split, but their specific views on cryptocurrency regulation will be closely watched. Q4: How did Crenshaw vote on the spot Bitcoin ETFs? Commissioner Crenshaw dissented against the January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. She published a detailed statement arguing that the approvals did not sufficiently protect investors from fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market. Q5: Will this make it easier for other crypto ETFs (like for Ethereum) to get approved? Potentially. Crenshaw was a noted skeptic of the entire asset class. Her absence removes one likely “no” vote from the commission. However, the approval of an Ethereum ETF or similar product would still depend on the applicant meeting the SEC’s stringent requirements and the views of the remaining four commissioners, including Chair Gensler.

The chart’s highest valuation band, ‘Maximum Bubble Territory’, spans roughly $334,173.88 to $449,435.85 and is historically associated with extreme overvaluation and late-cycle market euphoria. Just below it, the ‘Sell, Seriously, SELL!’ zone ranges from about $256,680.28 to $334,173.88, signaling conditions where long-term returns have historically weakened, and downside risk increased. The ‘FOMO intensifies’ band places Bitcoin between approximately $200,285.53 and $256,680.28, reflecting periods of accelerating retail participation and momentum-driven buying. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter Below that, the ‘Is this a bubble?’ level, running from around $157,214.21 to $200,285.53, points to elevated prices that often spark debate over sustainability without necessarily marking a market peak. The ‘HODL!’ zone, spanning roughly $120,036.03 to $157,214.21, represents valuations where long-term holders have historically been inclined to maintain positions amid strong but not excessive optimism. Further down, the ‘Still cheap’ band places the cryptocurrency between about $92,914.92 and $120,036.03, implying prices that in past cycles have offered favorable long-term risk-reward. The ‘Accumulate’ zone ranges from approximately $71,943.71 to $92,914.92 and reflects levels where investors have historically increased exposure during subdued sentiment. Below that, the ‘BUY!’ category spans roughly $53,350.41 to $71,943.71, a range associated with broad undervaluation in prior cycles. At the lowest end, the ‘Basically a Fire Sale’ zone places Bitcoin between about $40,828.60 and $53,350.41, representing deep-value territory that has historically aligned with strong long-term entry points after major drawdowns. Bitcoin’s possible Jan 31 price Taken together, the Rainbow Chart does not forecast a specific Bitcoin price for January 31, 2026, but outlines sentiment-based valuation bands that frame potential upside and downside scenarios. With Bitcoin currently trading at $89,777, the chart suggests a plausible path into late January 2026, within the ‘Still cheap’ or ‘HODL!’ zones, corresponding to roughly $93,000 to $157,000 if BTC continues to follow its historical growth curve.

The story was a little different for the digital asset market after the New Year’s holiday, with altcoins specifically enjoying the bulk of the rally. On Friday, January 2nd, the premier cryptocurrency jumped to above the psychological $90,000 level. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that there is no need for investors to be excited about the recent Bitcoin price action. Bitcoin Price Needs To Cross The STH Average Cost At $99,000 In a January 2nd post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that the recent price jump for Bitcoin does not say a lot about the current market structure. The on-chain data pundit’s evaluation is based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price, which currently lies around the $99,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K For context, the Short-Term Holder Realized Price is an on-chain metric that tracks the average price where Bitcoin short-term investors (holding for less than 115 days) acquired their coins. Being the average cost basis of the most reactive group of investors, the STH Realized Price often functions as a dynamic support and resistance level. While the price of BTC slipped beneath the Short-Term Holder Realized Price four times in the past year, it has been below this critical threshold since September 2025. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin price needs to close above this STH Realized Price at $99,000 before bull run conversations can resume. Kesmeci wrote on X: No bull market without the short-term investor with a broken heart being made happy. This statement reiterates the importance of short-term investors in market dynamics. For instance, in this case, breaking the Short-Term Holder Realized Price would suggest the return of demand and confidence among the most reactive investor cohort. Data Converges Between $99,000 And $102,000 Furthermore, Kesmeci pointed out that additional on-chain data reinforces the critical importance of the $99,000 region to the Bitcoin price trajectory. The crypto analyst said that significant data is converging in the $99,000 – $102,000 range, and until this region is surpassed, the price of BTC might continue to struggle. In an earlier post on the X platform, Kesmeci had revealed that the price of BTC needs to close above $101,000 for the long-term trend to turn positive. This explains why the analyst later concluded that the $99,000 – $102,000 bracket is pivotal to Bitcoin’s health. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $90,110, reflecting a roughly 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Many altcoins have performed a lot better on a daily scale, including some of the meme coin reps, such as DOGE and PEPE. BTC to Face More Volatility? After being one of the few global assets to end 2025 in the red , bitcoin’s price finally started to show some revival signs on January 2. Following a quiet January 1, in which it remained sideways between $87,000 and $88,000, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive yesterday and broke past $90,000 for the first time in about a week. This time, the bulls kept the pressure on and drove it even further north to a multi-week peak of $91,000. However, that was as far as BTC would go, at least for now, and it quickly retraced to $90,000. It added several hundred dollars late on Friday, but the explosions in Venezuela’s capital on Saturday morning halted its progress. Bitcoin dipped to $89,300 but now sits closer to $90,000 after US President Donald Trump confirmed that his country’s military was behind the strikes against Caracas. Moreover, he added that the US captured Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. A press conference is expected later today, which could result in more volatility in the crypto market, given that it’s the only financial market open today.

The timing of the incident has not fared well for Bitcoin, which slipped below $90,000 after trading above the price mark for the better part of Friday’s trading hours. As confirmed by CBS News, US troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and flew him outside the country in the company of his wife. Local news outlets reported that several explosions were heard around 1:50 AM local time on Saturday (12:50 AM Eastern Time). STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP pic.twitter.com/nHDqtsqRFh — Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) January 3, 2026 Trump wrote on Truth Social that “further details would follow,” and he would hold a press briefing at his Mar-a-Lago residence at 11 AM ET. The US also seized two Venezuelan oil tankers in recent weeks, launched strikes on more than 30 vessels allegedly carrying drugs, and hit “the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs.” Maduro denied all accusations of drug trafficking or collaboration with terrorist organizations. Venezuela’s president captured: What it means for crypto Just two hours after news about the Venezuelan air strikes broke, Bitcoin slipped downwards to $89,571, from nearly $91,000 the previous day. Several market analysts believe any form of war in the West, the purported “hotbed” for crypto adoption, is extremely bearish for digital assets just three days into the new year. “Oh, is Bitcoin back over 90K? It would be a real shame if someone… BOMBED VENEZUELA. Notice that all of the bullshit happens on Friday nights because Trump wants stock markets to have 48 hours to absorb the news,” Bitcoin investor Lark Davis surmised. According to market observer Ether Rawl, during Israel’s attack on Gaza in October 2023, Bitcoin dropped approximately 5% in the days following. He suggested the Venezuela strikes could push the king coin below the weekly 100 EMA, slightly under $86,000, and it is still unknown if a recovery will materialize. Trading group Money Ape sees the US-Venezuela tussle as a war on Bitcoin and crypto, and is adamant President Trump has chosen to take custody of Maduro now because “he is manipulating the market.” BREAKING: 🇺🇸 US is attacking Venezuela. And it's happening exactly when crypto is trying to recover. F*cking tired of this shit now. — Ash Crypto (@AshCrypto) January 3, 2026 The US dollar fell to around 98.2 on the first trading day of 2026, after counting a 9% annual loss in 2025. A fall in the greenback’s value would mean the crypto market is ready for a comeback under normal conditions, but with the war on Venezuela in play, Bitcoin bulls might not have enough in their tank to shake off end-2025’s bearish effects. “I am still long until 94k at least. The only problem I see is the war between Trump and Venezuela. If the conflict escalates, we’re going to have choppy price action,” economist Market Hokkage predicts. Political backlash from Liberals in the United States Before today’s events, congressional Democrats and some Republicans had attempted to limit Trump’s military options in Venezuela. They had been seeking to take away the POTUS’ powers through a congressional plea and forced votes in both the House and Senate, all of which were unsuccessful. Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a US Marine Corps veteran and part of the brigade against President Trump, wrote on X earlier today that the strikes are “illegal” and “the second unjustified war in his lifetime.” According to TRM Labs’ Country Crypto Adoption Index, Venezuela rose to 11th place globally in 2025, up from 14th in 2024, with just 27 million and a per capita GDP of $3,100. Venezuelans are using cryptocurrencies to preserve savings and to shield themselves from an unstable, inflation-ridden economy. The Trump critics propounded that airstrikes could stifle a growing crypto economy and destroy its oil economy that is already entangled with USDT. “If the United States succeeds in imposing control over Venezuela, and by extension over the world’s largest proven oil reserves, it will mark a major shift in global power. What happens in Venezuela will not stay in Latin America. It will shape the limits of American power, and the direction of geopolitical confrontation far beyond Caracas,” said Iranian journalist Ibrahim Majed.

The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project has raised $917,618 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Investors had adopted a wait-and-watch approach, but the recent uptick suggests risk appetite has returned. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. Official Launch Date Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Continues Uptrend Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market extended its uptrend as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and other tokens traded in positive territory. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $90,000 mark on January 2, reaching an intraday high of $90,832. However, with sellers active above $90,000, bulls lost momentum as the price dipped back below $90,000. However, buyers have prevented further downside, as BTC has held above $89,000. The price is up nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $89,634. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $3,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied from $3,025 to an intraday high of $3,143 before moving to $3,095, up over 2%. Ripple (XRP) is up 7% and Solana (SOL) is up over 2% at $130. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 7% and Cardano (ADA) is trading in positive territory, up 6% at $0.386. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable price increases over the past 24 hours. As a result, the crypto market cap is up 1.15% at $3.06 trillion. 24-hour trading volume has also registered a substantial increase of 68% to reach $118 billion.

56769737,https://cryptonews.com/?p=470041,1767446287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56769737.jpeg,Santiment Warns FOMO Could Return if Bitcoin Hits $92K,https://cryptonews.com/news/santiment-warns-fomo-could-return-if-bitcoin-hits-92k/,cryptonews,"Crypto analytics platform Santiment has cautioned that retail FOMO could emerge if Bitcoin climbs above $92,000. The warning comes as Bitcoin trades near $90,000 early in 2026, with social sentiment showing its strongest bullish spike in six months despite modest trading volumes during the post-holiday period. Source: TradingView Brian, Santiment’s head of content, noted during a January 2nd livestream that Bitcoin’s approach toward the psychological $90,000 threshold typically triggers retail buying pressure. “ Usually when we see something like 89.9K, there’s a bit of a retail push to at least hit that milestone, ” he explained, adding that such moves often precede increased volatility as limit sells activate and FOMO intensifies. Mixed Signals as New Year Trading Begins Market data reveals a complex picture as 2026 opens. Bitcoin’s social volume remained flat, with just a 0.06% change from the previous week, while Ethereum saw a minimal increase of 1%. Mid-cap altcoins attracted more attention, with Dogecoin discussions jumping 57% and Cardano rising 19%, suggesting retail interest may be shifting toward smaller assets after what traders called “ the bloodbath that was the end of 2025. “ Source: X/@santimentfeed Santiment’s positive-versus-negative sentiment ratio for Bitcoin reached nearly 2:1 on January 1st, the highest reading since early October. This marks the strongest bullish sentiment shift in over six months, though analysts remain cautious about interpreting the surge. “ I’m not necessarily going to be too worried about a lot of FOMO going on right now, ” Brian stated, noting the timing coincides with traders returning from holidays rather than genuine conviction. The sentiment spike appears exclusive to Bitcoin, with Ethereum and XRP showing more neutral readings. Mentions of “ higher or above ” also outweighed “ lower or below ” references, reinforcing the optimistic tone among retail traders. However, historical patterns suggest extreme bullish sentiment often precedes corrections as markets move contrary to crowd expectations. Whale Accumulation Provides Bullish Foundation On-chain metrics paint a more encouraging picture beneath the surface noise. Wallets holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin accumulated approximately 65,500 BTC since November 30th, with 55,400 BTC added in just the past two weeks alone. This represents the highest percentage of supply held by whales and sharks since November 10th. Maxim Balashevich, Santiment’s founder and CEO, suggested the current price action could reflect anticipation of MicroStrategy’s expected weekend purchases. “ There could be some players betting on the Saylor, ” he noted. “ Maybe can engage some retail jump to the wagon of new year buying might work. “ The accumulation pattern contrasts with retail behavior, as smaller wallets holding less than 0.01 Bitcoin continued adding to positions throughout the recent volatility. This simultaneous buying from both whales and retail investors creates uncertainty, as historical patterns favor rallies when large holders accumulate while small traders sell. $BTC path into 2026 looks increasingly mixed • $100K lost, no late-year rally • ETFs see outflows, macro pressure grows • Whales still accumulating on dips #Bitcoin #BTC #2026 https://t.co/24wCTbRK7W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 Choppy Waters Expected Before Directional Move Santiment analysts expect sideways trading through the weekend before clearer signals emerge. “ We need to wait until Monday to get more data ,” Balashevich stated, noting that many U.S. traders remain on holiday until next week. He anticipates potential upside through Sunday, driven by speculation around institutional buying, followed by either downside on Monday or continued consolidation, depending on broader market conditions. The 30-day market-to-realized-value ratio sits near breakeven, while the 365-day metric shows long-term holders down 11.5% from October’s all-time high of $126,000. Network growth remained strong at year-end, though profit-taking spiked to six-week highs on January 2nd as traders capitalized on the move toward $90,000. Looking ahead, Santiment emphasizes monitoring whether Bitcoin can break above $92,000 without triggering excessive retail enthusiasm. The platform’s data suggests that while whale accumulation provides bullish underpinning, a FOMO-driven rally above key resistance levels could set up conditions for a sharper correction once speculative fever peaks.

56770068,652163,1767441618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56770068.jpeg,Crypto Market Oracle: The Whale Who Nailed Every Top Makes 3 Bold Predictions For This Year,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-oracle-3-predictions-for-this-year/,bitcoinist,"Market expert DeFi Tracer has compiled a series of predictions from an influential figure in the cryptocurrency market — specifically, a “whale,” or an investor with a large portfolio. This particular whale has accurately anticipated every Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high and numerous crypto market tops since 2015. Long-term Vision The whale’s latest forecasts for 2026, unveiled in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), include an ambitious target of $250,000 for Bitcoin (BTC), $20,000 for Ethereum (ETH), and $1,500 for Solana (SOL). However, this whale’s insights extend beyond mere numbers. He emphasizes the current phase of infrastructure development that encompasses critical elements such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), custodial services, regulatory advancements, and the strategic adjustments made by corporate balance sheets. According to his analysis, the market’s transition into this new phase often triggers an initial decline in prices as speculation fades. He suggests that the rise won’t be immediate; instead, it will involve a gradual, steady demand as the market stabilizes. While not explicitly stated, his model indicates that he does not anticipate a quick surge in prices. Instead, he envisions “a pressure phase” characterized by several key developments: weak hands are shaken out, credit positions are liquidated, and “easy” leverage is removed from the market. This transition—moving from speculation to accumulation—typically follows a predictable sequence: speculation leads to heightened volatility , which is then followed by liquidations and fear, causing retail investors to exit. Ultimately, exits pave the way for stabilization, which sets the stage for future upside. What To Expect For Crypto In 2026 In this context, DeFi Tracer suggests that Bitcoin might experience a decline to around $50,000 before the accumulation phase begins in earnest. This implies a potential 44% correction ahead for the cryptocurrency from current trading levels slightly above $89,600. The reasoning behind this perspective is straightforward: the market requires a cleansing process before launching into a new bull run. Looking toward 2026, the indicators suggest that the whale’s analysis is on point. Signs indicate that the necessary cleansing of the market is nearing completion and that the long-awaited growth phase is just around the corner. Several macroeconomic factors underline this optimism. Notably, metals have reached all-time highs and are now shifting capital into cryptocurrencies. The traditional four-year market cycle has drawn to a close, while governments worldwide are showing increasing interest in acquiring cryptocurrencies. The expert concluded that while 2025 was marked by a correction and cleansing of the crypto market, 2026 is poised for what the whale describes as structural growth. This process will reportedly be methodical and steady rather than rapid and chaotic, suggesting a systematic recovery for cryptocurrencies.

56770241,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888258,1767447015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56770241.jpeg,US Senator argues that vague rules will cause crypto companies to relocate overseas,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lummis-urges-congress-to-pass-crypto-laws/,cryptopolitan,"Senator Cynthia Lummis is advocating for lawmakers to approve the CLARITY Act, which would establish clearer regulations for the industry. She argued that vague rules have long caused crypto companies to relocate overseas, noting that the proposed crypto legislation would alleviate uncertainty, establish clear rules, strengthen protections, and make the US a global leader. Insiders said that US lawmakers would review the CLARITY Act on January 15. If the markup goes through favorably, however, it would imply that lawmakers believe the bill will have sufficient support to pass a formal committee vote. At the same time, the push for clearer crypto rules comes as the United States grapples with a rapidly expanding national debt, which has climbed above $38 trillion , intensifying scrutiny of the country’s long-term fiscal outlook. Rising interest costs and persistent deficits have renewed interest among policymakers and investors in alternative financial technologies that could improve market efficiency and capital formation. John D’Agostino believes the bill will be enacted soon Speaking on the bill, Lummis urged legislators on X: “Our market structure legislation changes that by establishing clear jurisdiction, strong protections, and ensuring America leads the way. Let’s get this done!” In their review, legislators will be examining where DeFi aligns with federal law. They will also explore how to better distinguish between the SEC and CFTC’s roles in regulating digital assets. John D’Agostino, the Institutional Head of Strategy at Coinbase, says the bill is already on the path to progress, and he remains optimistic about its steady improvement, despite frustration from the crypto sector. He also expects the strategic bill to be passed soon. He addressed the bill’s delay in an interview with CNBC, saying that since the legislation is “fundamental” to crypto and other real asset classes, it is only reasonable that it takes time. There is a strong chance that the CLARITY Act will be enacted, he added, referring to growing global regulatory momentum and Spain’s forward-leaning initiatives as examples. Spain has already begun passing new cryptocurrency legislation, like the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8). D’Agostino also said that US lawmakers might feel pressured to act swiftly as other nations ramp up their cryptocurrency efforts. He added he hopes the bill can be approved this January. He also compared the bill to the GENIUS Act, stating that the former is more complex than the latter. But he sees the GENIUS Act as transformative, adding that the passage of the CLARITY Act would be another crucial milestone in the US’s crypto journey ahead. The CLARITY Act would need 60 votes to move forward If the Republicans voted as a bloc, the CLARITY Act would likely pass the committee level even without Democratic support. But its eventual passage would be more contentious. After the Senate Agriculture Committee piece is merged, 60 votes will be necessary in the Senate to end debate, hence the importance of cross-party support. Tim Scott, the chair of the Banking Committee, spoke to reporters ahead of the recess, saying the conversations with Democrats were fruitful, and some industry players responded cautiously with optimism. If the legislation were enacted, this would create rules that regulate the digital asset market in a way that moves beyond long-term, enforcement-driven regulation. It would also clarify which token types are considered securities or commodities, explain how exchanges and brokers can register, and enable regulators to exert more control over spot crypto. Supporters also said the changes would provide regulatory clarity and strengthen consumer protections, as well as America’s standing compared to places with clear frameworks for cryptocurrencies.

According to reports, the sophisticated phishing campaign is currently circulating within the community, posing significant risks to users intending to download the newly announced Eternl Desktop application. The hackers craft professional emails claiming to promote a legitimate wallet solution designed for secure Cardano staking and governance participation. The announcement uses terms related to users earning rewards, including NIGHT and ATMA token rewards through the current crypto giveaway program, to establish credibility and drive user engagement. Hackers are targeting Cardano wallet users According to reports, the hackers were able to create a replica of the official Eternl Desktop announcement, complementing it with a message about hardware wallet compatibility, local key management, and advanced delegation control. The email shows a polished, professional tone with proper grammar and no visible spelling errors, making it very effective at deceiving Cardano community members. Meanwhile, it distributes malware to any system it enters. Reports mentioned that the campaign uses a newly registered domain, download(dot)eternldesktop(dot)network, to distribute a malicious installer package without the need for an official verification or digital signature validation. In the detailed technical analysis carried out by Anurag, an independent threat hunter and malware analyst, the legitimate Eternl.msi file contains a hidden LogMeIn Resolve remote management tool bundled within its installation package. The discovery exposed a supply chain abuse attempt aimed at establishing persistent unauthorized access on victim systems. The malicious MSI installer, with a size of 23.3 megabytes and with hash 8fa4844e40669c1cb417d7cf923bf3e0, drops an executable called unattended updater.exe, which uses the original filename GoToResolveUnattendedUpdater.exe. During runtime analysis, the executable creates an identified folder structure under the system’s Program Files. Once it creates the Program Files, it creates a directory and writes multiple configurations, including unattended.json, logger.json, mandatory.json, and pc.json. The unattended.json configuration file enables remote access functionality without needing the user to interact. The dropped executable attempts to establish connections to infrastructure associated with legitimate GoTo Resolve Services, including devices-iot.console.gotoresolve.com and dumpster.console.gotoresolve.com. Malware provides hackers with remote access According to network analysis, the malware sends information to the hackers in JSON format. It also uses remote servers to establish a communication channel for command execution and system monitoring. Security researchers say this behavior is important because remote management tools allow hackers to carry out remote command execution and steal credentials once the malware is installed on a victim’s system. The Cardano phishing campaign also shows how hackers use crypto and the branding of legitimate platforms to distribute tools that have been infected with malware. This means that users need to verify the authenticity of the software they use through official channels. In addition, they must also avoid downloading wallet applications from unverified sources or newly registered domains, irrespective of how good their distribution emails appear. This Cardano phishing campaign is similar to the one that targeted customers using Meta for advertisements last year. Users are lured with emails that claim their ads have been temporarily suspended due to violations of advertising policies and EU regulations. The scammers even go as far as making it appear legitimate by adding the official Instagram branding and official-sounding language about policy violations. However, closer inspection showed that the emails were from a different domain. Researchers mentioned that upon clicking the link, users are redirected to a fake Meta Business page that looks convincing. The website mimics the real support site, opening up with a page that warns the user that their account faces termination if they do not take action immediately. Users are tricked into inputting their Ad login into the spaces provided, with the customer support guiding them with a provided step-by-step instruction to restore their accounts.

According to the report, scammers stole close to $33 million from victims. The FBI noted that in most cases, scammers impersonated either a company or a bank to carry out their illicit activities. The FBI claimed that some bad actors went as far as calling their victims and advising them to deposit money into a Bitcoin ATM to protect their funds. The criminals would tell them that their accounts have been compromised, riding on the panic to push them into sending the funds via a Bitcoin ATM for safekeeping. Instead, the money goes to a wallet or account maintained by the hacker or another person in their network. Bitcoin ATM fraud hits a new record in 2025 Bitcoin ATMs increased in popularity in the United States, with more than 30,000 machines in the state in 2024. The figure represents 81.27% of the total Bitcoin ATMs in the world, according to Finance Magnates. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) mentioned that more than 10,000 people were victims of Bitcoin ATM fraud in 2025 alone. The agency mentioned that there were over 12,000 complaints from January to December in 2025. In its statement, the FBI also mentioned that the monetary value lost to criminals reached $333.5 million, an increase compared to the same time span last year. In 2024, the FTC reported that digital assets scams in particular were more financially devastating than other types of fraud, noting that midway through the year, the median loss reported by individuals related to crypto fraud was $5,400. The median individual loss tied to reports of general fraud stood at $447. The FBI mentioned that the amount lost to the criminals has been on the rise with each passing year. Data from the FTC showed that Bitcoin ATMs were responsible for $114 million in reported losses in 2023 and $78 million in losses in 2022. This means that the reported losses due to Bitcoin ATM fraud more than doubled in the last two years. Notably, these are figures of reported losses, with the FTC not accounting for losses that were not reported. FTC urges users to be cautious The FTC has advised people to pay close attention to all red flags when making transactions with Bitcoin ATMs. They have also advised people to double-check with their financial officer or banks whenever they are contacted by someone they do not know to deposit funds in a Bitcoin ATM. The agency also advised individuals to slow down and not allow the other person at the end of the line to rush them into making payments, noting that they should discuss things with people around them before making any payment. Bitcoin has been one of the few instruments used to carry out fraud, with criminals choosing to use the asset because of its privacy-focused transactions. The FTC has also warned that government agencies and legitimate businesses will not contact users and ask them to pay for services in Bitcoin. Except otherwise stated, users should not pay for any service or goods using Bitcoin ATMs. In a case where someone is hounding them, they should report to the police. While fraud does not only affect certain demographics, scammers have been targeting the older generations more. This is because they are susceptible to crypto crimes, the data shows. In the report, victims 60 and above account for 715 of the reported losses using Bitcoin ATMs during the first half of 2024, losing $46 million according to the FTC. In some cases, the criminals used AI deepfakes of a family member, asking the elderly person to pay Bitcoin in exchange for their release from the police station. Get seen where it counts.

The premier cryptocurrency closed 2025 with a range-bound price performance, recording no significant movement in the past month of December. However, beneath this early price strength, recent on-chain evaluation reveals that Bitcoin may be at a critical point, where positive price action contrasts with underlying market dynamics. Negative Ratios Don’t Mean Price Bottoms: Alphractal CEO Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson recently took to X to explain what a negative Sharpe Ratio could mean for the Bitcoin price. For context, the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio is a metric that measures how efficiently Bitcoin’s returns compensate investors for the level of volatility (risk) taken over a given period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K Readings above 1 from this metric signal a healthy market, where investors are getting rewards for their stakes. On the other hand, values under 0 typically indicate that the market is in a high-risk, low-return state. Simply put, Bitcoin’s investors, in this scenario, are not being efficiently rewarded for their contributed capital. As observed in the chart above, the ratio recently slipped below the 0 threshold. Seeing as this is occurring while price regains previous levels, it becomes clear that there is an inefficiency between risk allocation and returns. Wedson further shared, based on historical data, that Bitcoin typically displays its best performance when its Sharpe Ratio is well above zero, particularly at levels 1 and above. This positive signal is usually proof of a consistent state of balance between risk and reward. In contrast, negative readings often correlate with prolonged consolidation periods, choppy price movements, or even cycle transitions, providing context to long-term investors on current market dynamics. Historically, these periods have appeared during cooling phases, or before sentiment resets, rather than precisely at market bottoms. By extension, this means that while downside risk may not be high, upside efficiency remains limited until market conditions see relevant improvement. Ultimately, Wedson concluded that the current level of the Sharpe Ratio calls for cautious optimism, especially as the low doesn’t necessarily mean the bottom is in. Bitcoin Price 2026 Outlook After closing 2025 in the red, the question has been swirling around how the Bitcoin price would perform in the new year. While various verdicts have filtered across the crypto community, weighted sentiment suggests that the market leader would continue its struggles in 2026. The lack of apparent demand growth shows that BTC might have already entered a bear market, with the bottom not due until the last quarter of 2026. In essence, the premier cryptocurrency might see an extended period of correction over the next few months. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at approximately $89,886, reflecting a 1.4% price jump over the past day.

While the price action remains below major moving averages, the recent bullish push is giving traders a reason to watch closely. Momentum is shifting, but major resistance levels still need to be cleared to confirm a reversal. XRP Technical Analysis: The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRPUSDT is trading around $2.00 after bouncing from the $1.8 support zone. The price is still within a descending channel, but today’s daily candle is testing the upper trendline. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages are sitting above, acting as dynamic resistance above the $2.30 zone. If the asset breaks the descending channel and flips this resistance zone, the next target lies around $2.50 and beyond. The RSI has broken above 60, suggesting strengthening momentum, but it is approaching overbought territory, which could cause short-term consolidation. The BTC Pair On the XRPBTC chart, the price has pushed strongly into the 2,230 sat region, after bouncing just above the 2,000 sat key mid-range level. The pair is now eyeing the critical supply zone at 2,500 sats. Earlier in December, the 100-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish outlook, with the former now acting as immediate resistance. Yet, the RSI is now accelerating upward, as the price is pushing higher aggressively. If the current momentum holds, XRP could challenge the upper resistance bands soon.

Back then, almost no one noticed. Fast-forward to today, seventeen years later, that creation has now become one of the most disruptive financial inventions in modern history, surviving ridicule, banks, crashes, and countless declarations of its death. Happy birthday, Bitcoin! 17-Years Old In its infancy, BTC was little more than an experiment among cryptographers and libertarians. It didn’t really have a known price, there were no exchanges where you could openly trade it, and there was no clear use case beyond peer-to-peer value transfer, which was actually intended in the whitepaper. The first known transaction occurred in May 2010 – the infamous Bitcoin Pizza Day , as it is referred to now, when 10,000 BTC was used to purchase two pizzas. At the time, though, Bitcoin was dismissed as a toy for geeks, a failed attempt at digital cash, or as “magical internet money” with no intrinsic value. Later, the first actual attention from the mainstream was for all the wrong reasons. Darknet marketplaces thrived in the early 2010s, and BTC became associated with illegal activity, drugs, and crime, which earned it a reputation as the currency of the underworld. The legacy media quickly labeled it a tool for criminals, and regulators warned that it had no legitimate future. That stigma followed it for years, despite later data showing that illicit activity accounted for only a small fraction of all BTC transactions. From Dead to Trillion-Dollar Asset Bitcoin’s debut on exchanges made it clear that the asset will face some enhanced volatility. It surged, it crashed, then surged again, only to collapse again, and then rise back up. This scenario has repeated countless times for the past over a decade. Given the fact that some of those corrections were by 50%, 60%, or even 80% at times, haters used every moment to call it ‘dead.’ In fact, there are roughly 450 such cases documented since 2010. It was called a bubble or “rat poison square.” It has been compared to the tulip mania, and renowned economists have warned that it would go to zero. However, it never did. Instead, it kept proving them wrong. The narrative began to change during the bull run in 2017 and was solidified after the COVID-19 crash and the subsequent rally. As governments printed unprecedented amounts of fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million units started to matter. Gradually, it was no longer pitched as just “digital cash.” It became something more: digital gold to some, a hedge against monetary debasement to others, or even a long-term store of value. It was further legitimized in 2024 when roughly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States. Later, it became a key factor in the country’s presidential elections, and there are talks about a US-based BTC strategic reserve. Not bad for a teenager. Community Celebrates Naturally, the ever-vocal cryptocurrency community was quick to celebrate Bitcoin’s birthday, which helped launch a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Strategy’s Saylor, the champion behind the world’s largest corporate BTC holder, published an orange cake on X, wishing the cryptocurrency a happy birthday, while Lucky posted: Seventeen years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world. What began as a quiet experiment is now a global monetary network.

56772558,652229,1767452403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56772558.jpeg,Bitfarms’ $30 Million Sale Ends Its Latin American Expansion Story,https://bitcoinist.com/bitfarms-30-million-sale-ends-its-latin-american-expansion-story/,bitcoinist,"Bitfarms Ltd. has completed the sale of its Paso Pe Bitcoin mining site in Paraguay, ending its presence in Latin America. The 70-megawatt facility was sold for up to $30 million, a move that the company says will free cash for projects in North America. Reports have disclosed the deal as part of Bitfarms’ plan to focus its energy and compute efforts closer to home. Sale Terms And Payout Schedule According to the company, the buyer is the Sympatheia Power Fund , managed by Singapore’s Hawksburn Capital, and the agreement calls for $9 million in cash at closing plus additional milestone payments that could total up to $21 million. A $1 million non-refundable deposit was already paid, and the remaining payments are tied to post-closing conditions expected to be completed over roughly 10 months. The transaction is expected to close within about 60 days, subject to customary conditions. Why Bitfarms Is Moving North Based on reports , Bitfarms’ management said the sale helps it concentrate on North American energy and computing work. Chief Executive Ben Gagnon was quoted saying that the deal brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows, which will be reinvested into North American high-performance computing and AI energy infrastructure in 2026. The company now says its energy portfolio is 100% North American. Market Reaction And Context Markets reacted quickly after the announcement. Traders noted an uptick in Bitfarms’ stock following news of the sale, reflecting investor interest in the company’s cash-flow move and strategic refocus. This sale follows earlier asset moves in Paraguay, including the transfer of other sites in recent months, showing a steady pullback from South America. Sympatheia Power Fund, the buyer, is presented as an infrastructure fund that will take over the Paso Pe site and related operations. Reports describe the fund as being managed by Hawksburn Capital, which is based in Singapore. The buyer’s intentions for the site were not fully detailed in the announcement, but the transfer was framed as a normal handoff of a running energy and mining asset. Analysts have watched miners rework portfolios since the Bitcoin halving and as demand for data compute has risen. Some companies are shifting assets toward flexible power use or repurposing sites for AI and HPC workloads. Bitfarms’ move is one of several examples where operators sell overseas plants and redeploy capital into the US and Canada.

Just minutes ago, the POTUS addressed the public after today’s developmentс, and even hinted at potential actions against Mexico. BTCUSD Jan 3. Source: TradingView CryptoPotato reported earlier today that the primary cryptocurrency dipped from almost $91,000 – its peak on Friday, to just under $89,300 after reports emerged about explosions in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas. Minutes later, the Trump administration confirmed the speculations that the US was behind the attacks. Moreover, officials stated that Venezuela’s President, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were captured and were being transported to the US. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said later that both had been indicted in the Southern District of New York, as Maduro was charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, and several other similar counts. During Trump’s first interview for the day with Fox News, the POTUS said Maduro tried to negotiate at the end, but he refused. He also said the US will be “strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry from now on, according to reports from Walter Bloomberg. He added that China won’t have a problem with this operation as they will get oil, even though Chinese officials had entered Venezuela hours before the attacks.

This strategic enhancement, effective immediately, represents a major commitment to transparency and accessibility in the volatile crypto sector. Consequently, traders and investors worldwide will now receive continuous updates during core trading hours. The move addresses the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency markets, which operate without traditional closing bells. Therefore, this development marks a pivotal moment for financial journalism in the digital age. Bitcoin World’s Enhanced 24-Hour News Coverage Schedule Bitcoin World’s new operational framework establishes a clear and structured timeline for news delivery. The platform will now provide uninterrupted, real-time cryptocurrency news coverage from Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC through Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC. This schedule strategically covers the vast majority of active global trading periods across major financial hubs. During the designated window from Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC to Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC, the editorial team will shift to a monitored standby mode. However, they will publish immediate updates for major breaking news events, such as regulatory announcements, significant security breaches, or extreme market volatility. This balanced approach ensures resource sustainability while maintaining critical coverage. The decision follows extensive analysis of global trading volume data and reader engagement patterns. Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken report consistent liquidity throughout the week. For instance, weekend trading often sees heightened volatility due to lower liquidity, making timely news even more crucial. Bitcoin World’s schedule now aligns perfectly with these market realities. The editorial team has implemented a structured shift system to manage the expanded hours effectively. This system ensures consistent editorial standards and fact-checking protocols are maintained around the clock. Furthermore, the platform has invested in additional monitoring tools for global regulatory wires and blockchain analytics. Addressing the 24/7 Nature of Digital Asset Markets Unlike traditional stock markets, cryptocurrency networks never close. Blockchain transactions settle continuously, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols operate autonomously at all hours. This creates an insatiable need for timely information. A 2024 report by the Crypto Market Integrity Coalition highlighted that over 35% of major price movements occur outside standard U.S. market hours. Bitcoin World’s new schedule directly mitigates this information gap. The platform will now track developments across all time zones, from Asian market openings to North American late-night sessions. This comprehensive coverage is essential for risk management and informed decision-making. The Strategic Rationale Behind Expanded Crypto Journalism This expansion is not merely a logistical change but a strategic response to evolving market demands. The cryptocurrency industry has matured significantly, attracting institutional investors, regulated funds, and corporate treasuries. These professional participants require reliable, constant information flows to manage portfolios and comply with oversight requirements. Bitcoin World’s initiative fills a notable void in the current media landscape. Many traditional financial news outlets still treat crypto as a niche segment, offering sporadic coverage. In contrast, dedicated crypto media often lacks the structured editorial rigor of established news organizations. Bitcoin World aims to bridge this divide by applying journalistic standards to continuous coverage. The platform’s editorial director cited the increasing correlation between crypto assets and macroeconomic news as a key driver. Events like Federal Reserve announcements, inflation data releases, or geopolitical tensions now instantly impact digital asset prices. These events can occur at any time. Therefore, having a dedicated team to provide context and analysis in real-time adds tremendous value for the community. The schedule also accounts for the global nature of crypto regulation. Important policy statements from authorities in Europe, Asia, or the Middle East can happen during traditional off-hours for Western media. Continuous coverage ensures these developments are reported without delay. Key operational highlights of the new schedule include: Real-time alerts for market-moving events like exchange outages or large wallet movements. Scheduled analysis of daily market opens in Asia, Europe, and North America. Live coverage of major blockchain network upgrades or governance votes. Breaking news protocols for security incidents and regulatory actions. Implementing Journalistic Rigor on a Continuous Clock Maintaining accuracy and neutrality during 24-hour operations presents unique challenges. Bitcoin World has developed a multi-layered verification system to address this. All breaking news alerts undergo a two-source confirmation minimum before publication. The editorial team utilizes a tiered response system, categorizing events by urgency and potential impact. For example, a suspected exchange hack triggers an immediate factual bulletin, followed by deeper investigative reporting. This process balances speed with reliability. The platform also employs blockchain forensic tools to verify on-chain events independently. This technical capability strengthens its reporting and builds trust with a technically savvy audience. Impact on Traders, Investors, and the Crypto Ecosystem The primary beneficiaries of this expanded coverage are active market participants. Day traders, algorithmic trading firms, and institutional desks rely on minute-by-minute information to execute strategies. Even long-term investors benefit from immediate awareness of fundamental changes, such as protocol failures or regulatory shifts. Enhanced news transparency can also improve overall market health. Studies in traditional finance, like those from the MIT Sloan School, show that timely information dissemination reduces information asymmetry and can decrease volatility spikes. In crypto’s often-opaque markets, reliable journalism acts as a public good. It empowers all participants with equal access to critical facts. Furthermore, the move raises the bar for crypto media as a whole. It signals a transition from blog-style commentary to professional, around-the-clock journalism. This evolution is crucial for the asset class’s legitimacy. As more traditional finance players enter the space, they expect information standards comparable to those covering equities or bonds. Bitcoin World’s investment in continuous coverage meets this expectation head-on. The schedule also supports the growing ecosystem of crypto derivatives. Futures and options traders, in particular, need to monitor news constantly to manage leverage and risk. A gap in coverage could lead to significant, avoidable losses for these market participants. Comparison of Crypto News Coverage Models Model Coverage Hours Typical Update Speed Best For Traditional Financial News Market Hours + Breaking Minutes to Hours Macro Overview Social Media / Forums 24/7 (Unofficial) Instant (Unverified) Sentiment & Rumors Dedicated Crypto Blogs Business Hours Hours Deep-Dive Analysis Bitcoin World (New Model) 24/7 with Structured Breaks Real-Time (Verified) Active Trading & Risk Management Conclusion Bitcoin World’s implementation of a structured 24-hour cryptocurrency news coverage schedule represents a substantial advancement for the industry. This initiative directly responds to the non-stop nature of digital asset markets and the professionalization of its participants. By providing verified, real-time news during core global trading hours, the platform enhances market transparency and empowers better decision-making. The careful balance of continuous coverage with scheduled maintenance periods ensures editorial sustainability and quality. Ultimately, this move strengthens the foundational information layer of the crypto ecosystem, supporting its continued growth and integration into the global financial system. As the market evolves, such commitments to rigorous, accessible journalism will remain indispensable. FAQs Q1: What exactly are the new operating hours for Bitcoin World’s news coverage? The platform now provides full, real-time coverage from Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC until Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC. From Saturday 3:00 p.m. to Sunday 10:00 p.m. UTC, it operates in a breaking-news-only mode. Q2: Why is 24-hour coverage necessary for cryptocurrency news? Cryptocurrency markets and blockchain networks operate continuously, unlike traditional stock exchanges. Major price movements, hacks, and regulatory news can happen at any time, requiring constant information access for effective trading and risk management. Q3: How will Bitcoin World ensure news accuracy during overnight or weekend shifts? The platform employs a multi-source verification system, dedicated monitoring tools, and a tiered editorial protocol. All breaking news requires confirmation from at least two independent sources before publication, maintaining rigorous standards. Q4: Does this mean there will be no news at all during the shorter Saturday-to-Sunday window? No. During that period, the team will monitor for and publish updates only for major breaking news events, such as significant exchange issues, critical regulatory announcements, or severe market disruptions. Q5: How does this change benefit the average crypto investor, not just active traders? All investors benefit from timely, accurate information. Long-term holders need to know about fundamental threats like network vulnerabilities or regulatory changes immediately. This coverage reduces information asymmetry and helps everyone make more informed decisions.

December ended with 58 disclosed investment projects, up 3.6% from 56 in November. Monthly funding moved in the opposite direction. Disclosed capital for December totaled $860 million, down 94.1% from $14.54 billion in November. Crypto deal activity contracts while capital concentrates The entirety of 2025 saw 898 disclosed investment projects, a 42.1% plunge from 1,551 projects in 2024, meaning few deals are carrying far larger checks across the crypto venture capital market. According to RootData, DeFi took the largest share at 22.4% of total crypto VC projects, CeFi followed at 13.8%, while AI had 12.7%. RWA and DePIN made up 7.3%, as L1 and L2 projects reached 6%, and NFT/GameFi slipped to 5.3%, matching tools and wallets at 5%. The year’s largest transaction landed in November when Naver agreed to acquire Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, in an all‑stock deal valued at about $10.3 billion, pushing Naver’s value to 4.9 trillion won and Dunamu’s to 15.1 trillion won. Crypopolitan had in October reported that Dunamu saw consolidated operating income of 1.19 trillion won for the first nine months of 2025, up 22% year-over-year, with 97.9% of revenue tied to trading platforms, including Upbit. In May, Coinbase completed a $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, paying $700 million in cash and the remainder in stock. Mega financing deals boost corporate balance sheets holding crypto Corporate issuance drove many of the year’s largest crypto VC raises, starting in July when Strategy raised $2.52 billion through its fourth preferred stock product, Stretch, with net proceeds of about $2.474 billion after fees. Crypopolitan then reported that Strategy used the funds to buy 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256, making its total holdings now 628,791 BTC, or $74 billion. Earlier in February, Strategy had issued $2 billion in zero‑coupon notes due 2030, carrying a 40% to 50% conversion premium and a three‑year put option. In October, Intercontinental Exchange, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in Polymarket at an $8 billion pre‑investment valuation. The deal gave ICE a stake and global distribution rights for Polymarket’s event‑driven data. In March, Abu Dhabi MGX (funded by the Abu Dhabi government and controlled by the royal family) invested $2 billion in Binance for a minority stake, paid for using stablecoins exclusively, and became the largest crypto‑asset‑only investment recorded. In September, Forward Industries completed a $1.65 billion private placement using cash and stablecoins to launch a Solana‑based digital asset vault strategy, led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. In March, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, securing a CFTC‑registered FCM license to offer futures and derivatives in the United States while expanding in the U.K., EU, and Australia. In August, Galaxy Digital closed $1.4 billion in debt financing to fund the Helios AI data center in Texas under a long‑term agreement with CoreWeave.

These patterns help traders and investors understand the mechanics behind rotations, momentum, and accumulation across major digital assets. While individual performance varies, analyzing structural formations provides insight into how capital may flow between Bitcoin and altcoins over extended periods. This framework was highlighted by a pseudonymous X user, Stockmoney Lizards, a crypto strategist renowned for studying cross-asset dynamics and technical setups. He noted that even assets he is less bullish on, such as XRP, can serve as clear examples of multi-year breakout patterns, offering a template to observe broader market behavior. Altcoins Form a Comparable Structure Stockmoney Lizards observed that altcoins, measured against Bitcoin, are forming a structure similar to XRP’s breakout pattern. Currently, many altcoins remain technically oversold, signaling potential for recovery once broader market conditions align. I am not a huge fan of XRP, but it will serve as an example for a multi-year breakout pattern, I have rarely seen before. If you look at Altcoins chart vs. BTC (lower image), a similar formation is just building up. My scenario for 2026 would be as follows: – Bitcoin maybe… pic.twitter.com/ezo0MwnOb1 — Stockmoney Lizards (@StockmoneyL) January 2, 2026 Historical trends suggest that assets showing such setups often attract algorithm-driven activity first, which then pulls in retail and institutional traders, amplifying momentum. This indicates that, while Bitcoin may consolidate or range initially, capital could rotate into altcoins , creating upward pressure across the sector. Understanding these patterns provides traders with actionable insight beyond simple speculation. Projected Market Rotation in 2026 According to Stockmoney Lizards, Bitcoin may range for a period before breaking out to a new all-time high. Following this, Bitcoin dominance could decline, allowing altcoins to recover strongly. Even if altcoins face another corrective phase toward the end of 2026, this cycle could establish higher bases compared to current levels, setting the foundation for the next upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This scenario relies on structural market principles rather than speculation. The concept of money rotation, well-known in traditional finance, predicts that capital flows from previously dominant assets to underperforming but technically promising alternatives, often fueling sustained momentum. Technical Catalysts and Institutional Support Structural catalysts also support this rotation. Multiple ETF launches targeting crypto exposure , including altcoins, enhance liquidity and attract institutional participation. These factors increase the likelihood of rapid market moves once technical reversals confirm initial trends. Assets that have underperformed significantly become more appealing as investors seek value and diversification. Patterns Over Preference Stockmoney Lizards emphasizes that the lesson lies in observing patterns rather than personal preference. XRP illustrates how multi-year breakout formations provide insight into potential altcoin surges and broader market rotations. By studying these structures, traders can anticipate flows between Bitcoin and altcoins, positioning themselves to capitalize on both short-term reversals and long-term trends.

However, this downside momentum soon weakened after the flagship cryptocurrency encountered its $85,000 support. Since then, Bitcoin traded mostly within a consolidatory range, struggling to break out of either end of the chart convincingly. Interestingly, an on-chain analysis has been released that examines the dynamics that may have influenced BTC’s December performance. Binance Inflows See Rapid Monthly Decline From $24.7B To $16.54B In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, market expert CryptoOnchain shares findings on evaluating inflows into Binance in the name of Bitcoin. The indicator involved in this analysis is the Binance Monthly Inflow By UTXO Age metric, which determines how much Bitcoin (in USD or BTC terms) flows into Binance each month, broken down by the age of the UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) being deposited. CryptoOnchain highlights that this downturn in money inflows was influenced by young UTXOs (transactions less than a day old). From its November high of approximately $24.7 billion, the metric quickly dropped to $16.54 billion in December, marking an $8.16 billion inflow gap. Typically, young UTXOs are a means through which short-term speculative behavior can be tracked, seeing as they are representative of recently transferred coins. Hence, the significant drop in Binance inflow indicates a growing unwillingness among short-term holders to sell their coins. It is worth noting that heightened inflows from this investor group point to a growing inclination to sell. This translates to the Bitcoin price as elevated bearish pressure, which leads to short-term price corrections. The inflows decline in December is therefore an inversion. It reveals a “cooling of speculative activity,” which in turn translates on the charts as a significant loss of selling pressure. The crypto pundit further highlights possible reasons for this exodus of speculative activity. Structurally, the analyst conjectures that the inflow decline could be due to fading price momentum, characteristic of the final days of the year. Short-term holders might have exited the market due to caution, to observe what the new year brings, without getting caught in the mix. This action then causes a “handover of supply control” to Bitcoin’s mid-term and long-term investors. Historically, such transitions have been associated with consolidation phases and periods of lower volatility, where no significant amount of directional momentum is seen. Hence, if history is anything to go by, the Bitcoin price could be gearing up for sustainable cycles in the coming months. Bitcoin Price Overview At press time, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $89,533, with CoinMarketCap data showing a daily growth of 0.85%.",Bitcoin|binance|bitcoin|CryptoOnchain|CryptoQuant|Short Term Trader Activity|Young UTXOs,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The top cryptocurrency in the world ended the year with a negative performance of around 5% in value. The cryptocurrency is presently stuck in a narrow band around $88,410. Not many people are pleased with this performance in the market. It has been noticed that they are selling Bitcoin at a discount. Investors who are looking for actual growth have to come up with a different approach. They are leaving the stagnant coins behind and looking for projects which have the potential to make yields. One such cheap crypto project which smart money is showing interest in is called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for short. It provides a clear way to a massive profit thanks to a strong DeFi proposition. The Problem with a Stagnant Giant Bitcoin is considered digital gold and is wonderful for overall stability. However, it misses the strong yield structures exhibited by cheaper cryptocurrency projects. At the current moment, Bitcoin is exhibiting low volatility and a negative return on the year. This is putting the endurance of investors to the test. The constant pressure from selling indicates that investors are looking for alternatives. A Project Constructed With Value In Mind While the overall market is struggling, the purchase demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is immense. The presale of MUTM has already raked in over $19.5 million. Over 18,650 individuals have already owned the MUTM tokens. The current phase is Phase 7, and the cost of each unit of MUTM is $0.04. The current price is already 300% higher than that of Phase 1, but according to experts, the best days of MUTM are yet to come. The chance to acquire at a price of $0.04 will expire soon, at which point Phase 8 will commence at a higher price of $0.045. Acquiring the tokens now, prior to market listing at $0.06, will render an immediate profit for the investor. The possibility of appreciating further will kick off at market listing. Accumulate Rewards For Holding MUTM Mutuum Finance also has a system for rewarding its supporters. The fees generated through lending on the platform are used automatically to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. The tokens are then given out for free as dividends to the people who stake in the system. This is a very powerful feedback loop. The more people using Mutuum Finance, the more fees, and vice versa, the more tokens are bought back. The more buybacks, the bigger the rewards for holders. This ensures that long-term holders receive rewards twice. Mutuum Finance is almost ready to be launched. The V1 platform of Mutuum Finance is to be launched on the testnet very soon. The trustworthiness of the project has been made sure after the completion of a security audit performed by Halborn. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty program launched to find the bugs present in the platform. Investors who take proactive steps will see that this presale is their final opportunity before a price hike is introduced. Additionally, with a limited supply of tokens in circulation and a soon-to-be-launched platform, there is sufficient evidence that indicates that its price will appreciate. A Smart Move for Better Returns Whereas Bitcoin remains stagnant, shrewd investors are allocating their funds to projects with engines of growth. Mutuum Finance presents an opportunity that leans heavily on the concept of scarcity and utilizes the connection to the success of the platform as the driving factor. The presale phase of the platform is near completion. For those interested in turning market uncertainty into major portfolio growth, membership in the MUTM presale will prove to be an intelligent decision. It’s a choice to join a project intended for use in the future of finance.

The numbers that many share on social media can be distorted by exchange moves, not fresh buying. That distortion matters because large transfers tied to exchanges can look like one entity is piling in, when the action is often internal bookkeeping. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Whale Wallet Totals Can Be Misleading Exchange firms often merge funds from many small accounts into fewer large wallets for operational or compliance reasons. When that happens, onchain trackers may count those consolidated addresses as “whales,” inflating the apparent number of very large holders. According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, once those exchange-related shifts are removed from the data, the balance held by true large holders is still falling. Balances in addresses holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC have dropped, a trend that lines up with outflows from spot ETFs. No, whales are not buying enormous amount of Bitcoin. Most Bitcoin whale data out there has been “affected” by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances, this is why whales seem to have accumulated a lot of coins recently. We… pic.twitter.com/dk9XqqckIX — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) January 2, 2026 Long-Term Holders Turning Buyer Reports have disclosed that another group has shifted its behavior. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, says long-term holders have been net accumulators over the past 30 days after what was their biggest selling spree since 2019. That change could reduce one major source of selling pressure. It does not guarantee a rally, but it does mean at least one key cohort stopped adding to the sell side. Markets react to who is buying and who is selling, and this move by long-term holders softens the case that a single group is driving prices lower. Price Action Shows Mixed Signals Bitcoin has been hovering around the $90,000 area during thin holiday trading. At the time of reporting, the price was about $89,750 Saturday, with 24-hour volume near $52 billion. The token sits roughly 2.8% below a recent day high of $90,250 and carries a market capitalization of about $1.75 trillion based on a circulating supply close to 20 million BTC. Trading has seen sharp moves up and down, but volume has been weak, which means moves lack the support needed for a clear breakout or breakdown. Market Moves Hinge On ETF Flows Since US spot Bitcoin ETFs became active in early 2024, the ownership picture has changed. ETFs now hold a large share of on- and off-chain demand, which can shift where Bitcoin is stored and how flows appear on onchain charts. Reports suggest that ETF outflows have helped drive lower balances in the 100–1,000 BTC band, while at the same time some long-term holders are quietly buying.

Claims of a massive whale reaccumulation wave were overblown because they did not account for exchange consolidation. Yet the story is not one-sided. Long-term holders have shown buying interest, even as large non-exchange addresses continue to shed some holdings. Future price direction will likely depend on whether ETF flows return in size and whether trading volume picks up enough to confirm any move.

According to ScamSniffer, the user in question had signed a malicious “permit” signature, which was what led to the theft. That signature was an off-chain approval mechanism, and it allegedly allows tokens to be spent without triggering an immediate on-chain transaction. ScamSniffer shared screenshots of the transactions. As to how the victim was susceptible to the exploit, they believe the scammers would have gotten the victim to sign the permit via a phishing site or cloned dApp, giving them access to drain the wallet. How did the scam happen? SlowMist’s founder, Cosine, commented on the haul, pointing out that the specific phishing group behind the attack is not one of the “mainstream” drainer groups, which suggests an emergence of smaller, sophisticated independent attackers. They also moved fast, rapidly converting the funds to ETH and then laundering the funds immediately via Tornado Cash. The incident was highlighted on January 3 by ScamSniffer via its X page, not long after it dropped its 2025 yearly report. In the report , as reviewed by Cryptoplitan, it revealed there was an overall 83% drop in crypto phishing losses, falling from $494 million to $84 million. However, it emphasized that sophisticated wallet drainers still abound. They just seem to be targeting high-value holders with permit-oriented attacks, as is often the case during a bull market. Permit-based exploits depend on the user’s trust in routine signature requests that actually authorize token transfers off-chain. Unfortunately for scams like these, recovery is very unlikely as the draining happens on-chain and transactions are irreversible. Crypto phishing losses went down, but wrench attacks went up While ScamSniffer has confirmed crypto phishing losses went down in 2025, crypto security experts claim the frequency of so-called “$5 wrench attacks” went up. Ari Redbord, the global head of policy and government affairs at crypto analytics firm TRM Labs, called 2025 a record year for wrench attacks, with roughly 60 reported physical assaults on crypto holders, up from 41 in 2024 and 36 in 2021. However, Redbord believes the actual number of attacks that have happened is significantly higher. “Many incidents are logged simply as robberies or burglaries, with the crypto element omitted, while others are never reported due to victim hesitation or uncertainty about how law enforcement will handle crypto-related crimes,” Redbord claimed. The cybersecurity risk called the “ wrench attack ” derives its name from the idea that even the most sophisticated forms of encryption and data security are susceptible to physical coercion — like getting threatened by a “$5 wrench.” These attacks are inarguably worse than phishing exploits and protocol hacks as they not only put assets at risk but also lives, increasing the stakes for maintaining proper OPSEC beyond wallet management best practices. “No matter how many technical precautions you take or how many factors you authenticate with, no individual is immune to human attack vectors,” Tor Bair, CEO of Hybrid Minds Advisory and former president of the Secret Foundation, said. Although the true number of wrench attacks is difficult to quantify, there appears to be either a higher risk of victimization or, at least, a greater awareness of the threat. Last year May, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau spoke up about the rise of crypto-related assaults in the country, which at the time was the site of about one-third of wrench attacks in 2025, including the high-profile kidnapping and torture of Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife in January.

CryptoQuant Researcher Says No,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-really-back-in-the-market-cryptoquant-no/,bitcoinist,"The price of Bitcoin has made a solid start to the new year, jumping above the $90,000 mark on Friday, January 2nd. While this newly-found momentum could have been triggered by a plethora of factors, an on-chain expert has pointed out that whale activity is not one of them. Look Closer: BTC Whale Holdings Actually In Decline In a recent post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno argued that the largest Bitcoin investors are not back buying enormous amounts of BTC. This conclusion is based on the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change and Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart. As the name suggests, the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change chart shows the total balance of addresses with more than 1,000 coins and how it has changed in the past month. Meanwhile, the Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart depicts the change in the balance of investors with between 100 and 1,000 BTC (capturing exchange-traded fund holdings). What’s more peculiar is that the Total Whale (and Dolphin) Holdings and Monthly % Change excludes exchange wallet addresses. According to Moreno, the majority of Bitcoin whale data has been skewed by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances, explaining why whales seem to be in a reaccumulation phase recently. Interestingly, the data is indeed skewed, as upon removing all exchange addresses’ data, the total Bitcoin whale balances shows a decline rather than an ascent. The same trend can be seen in the lower Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart in the image below. This shrinking balances of Bitcoin whales tells a story of waning demand in the market, sending signals of the start of a bear market. As seen in past cycles, the lack of apparent demand growth is the most telltale sign of impending correction phase for the Bitcoin price. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $90,320, reflecting an over 2% leap in the past 24 hours. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Suffering Historic Losses Since its trading debut, the US Bitcoin ETF market has been an excellent way to judge investor demand in the cryptocurrency market. However, market data hasn’t been telling a pretty story for the flagship cryptocurrency in recent weeks. For context, the largest Bitcoin ETF , BlackRock’s IBIT, posted roughly $244 million in net outflows last week, marking its 2nd-consecutive weekly withdrawal. The fund has now witnessed net withdrawals in 8 of the last 10 weeks, with a total of just 20 weekly outflows since its launch two years ago. According to recent data, crypto funds registered approximately $446 million in net outflows last week, marking the sixth week of withdrawal over the last nine weeks.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto|Julio Moreno,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

About 19 .8% of Argentina’s population were using digital assets in 2025, with USDT and Bitcoin being the most popular types in circulation. Why are Argentines into crypto? Argentina led Latin America in cryptocurrency adoption throughout 2025. The country’s adoption rates place it among the world’s top 20 markets. Argentines use virtual assets as protection against inflation and peso volatility, while others view them as more efficient alternatives to traditional payment systems. According to the Blockchain Argentina Foundation’s latest report, which incorporates data from major exchanges including Ripio, Decrypto, and Satoshi Tango, crypto adoption grew by 0.8% during 2025, with 19.8% of the population now using some type of cryptocurrency. This means nearly one in five Argentines has embraced digital assets as part of their finances. “Almost no one today considers having their money stagnant, without ‘working’. That’s why the use of wallets that ‘kill’ for giving a differential is growing and will continue to expand.” Analyst Rodrigo Mansilla noted . Exchanges offer attractive returns on crypto-denominated deposits that traditional banks cannot match. Mansilla explained that adoption was previously related to devaluation and the need to preserve purchasing power; today, crypto usability has significantly expanded with yields in crypto dollars and other attractive uses. The Argentine Fintech Chamber has confirmed that new users continue signing up despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions. Decrypto’s annual growth recorded close to 20% an d de tected sustained interest from a new segment: small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Which cryptocurrencies are Argentines actually using? Stablecoins are the most popular in the region and are used as tools for saving and covering inflation, plus their utility for international transfers. Up to 80% of Decrypto transactions are made using this stablecoin. Satoshi Tango presents Bitcoin as the lead adopted cryptocurrency and USDT as the second, with monthly variations depending on factors like vacations, Christmas bonuses, or elections. In Decrypto, 70% of customers ar e me n with an average age of 35 years, predominantly residing in large cities. Satoshi Tango reports 80% male and 20% female users, with ages mostly ranging from 35 to 65 years, and a strong presence in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, and Mendoza. Ripio provided granular data showing 65.47% male users and 34.51% female users, with 0.01% non-binary individuals. The strongest segment falls between 25 and 34 years old, followed by the 35 to 44 age group, with half of the users residing in Buenos Aires province and 10% in Buenos Aires city.

Bitcoin Enters Choppy Range As Critical Trend Line Holds Below,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-enters-choppy-range/,newsbtc,"Bitcoin has entered a choppy weekend range, testing traders’ patience as price action slows and volatility compresses. Despite the sideways movement, a critical trend line just below current levels remains intact, keeping the broader market outlook cautious but far from broken. Bitcoin Drifts Into A Typical Weekend Range According to a recent update by Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin has entered a typical weekend range. Weekend trading is often characterized by low liquidity and choppy price action, which can make moves less predictable and more prone to false signals. Snyder is taking a cautious approach, waiting for a clear trigger at the boundaries of this range before committing to any trades. Related Reading: Bitcoin Key Moving Averages Indicate An Imminent Drop To $38,000 Snyder notes that the $90,930 level could present a strong shorting opportunity if a liquidity sweep occurs and the price fails to hold. On the other hand, if Bitcoin demonstrates strength and manages to break above this threshold, it could signal bullish momentum, making long positions potentially attractive for traders looking to capitalize on a breakout. Similarly, the lower boundary near $88,430 is critical. A sweep below this level followed by a quick reversal could offer long positions. However, if the support fails and the market structure breaks, it would likely trigger continuation shorts. These levels act as key decision points where traders can gauge whether momentum favors buyers or sellers in the short term. Snyder emphasizes that these setups are primarily scalp trades, with lower risk exposure. The expert only executes trades when all confirmation signals align, ensuring that a clear technical rationale backs each position. Looking ahead, external factors could add more volatility to Bitcoin’s price action. Geopolitical tensions and the return of major market participants next week are expected to increase trading volume and momentum, potentially turning these weekend range moves into larger trends. BTC Holds Key Investor Tool Model Support Around $83,900 Crypto analyst Patel recently highlighted that Bitcoin is holding a key support level known as the Investor Tool Model Support, situated around $83,900, which also coincides with the 730-day moving average. This level has historically acted as a major pivot for Bitcoin, helping to gauge the broader market trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Unusual Short-Term Supply Spike, Raising Bearish Flags According to Patel, a decisive break below this support has historically signaled the start of a confirmed bear market, while holding above it typically points to a corrective phase rather than a long-term downtrend. In other words, this level serves as a critical dividing line between temporary pullbacks and structural weakness. Currently, the $83,900 zone is a key area to watch closely. Price action around this support could determine whether Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory or risks entering a more extended bearish phase, making it a pivotal point for decision-making in the market.

This surge represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, marking its highest valuation in the current market cycle and igniting discussions about its underlying drivers and potential trajectory. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $91,000 Surge The ascent past $91,000 follows a period of sustained upward momentum for Bitcoin. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors propelling this rally. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure, particularly on major exchanges like Binance. Furthermore, on-chain metrics indicate a reduction in exchange reserves, suggesting a trend toward accumulation rather than immediate selling. This price action is not occurring in isolation. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency market cap has expanded in tandem, though Bitcoin’s dominance ratio remains a key watch metric for institutional and retail investors alike. Several technical indicators aligned to support this breakout. The price convincingly moved above several key moving averages, which now act as potential support levels. Trading volume spiked notably during the ascent, providing validation for the move’s strength. Market sentiment, as gauged by various fear and greed indices, has shifted firmly into optimistic territory, though not yet at extreme levels historically associated with market tops. Historical Context and Market Drivers To understand the importance of the $91,000 level, one must consider Bitcoin’s price history. This milestone sits well above previous cycle highs, establishing a new benchmark. The journey to this point involved overcoming significant resistance zones, each representing a consolidation of seller interest. Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a crucial role. For example, evolving monetary policy, inflation data, and geopolitical stability all influence investor appetite for alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Institutional adoption provides another critical layer of context. Recent filings with regulatory bodies show increased exposure from traditional finance entities. Moreover, regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has reduced a longstanding overhang on the market. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for scaling, also contribute to its fundamental value proposition. The following table compares key Bitcoin price milestones from recent years: Date Price Milestone Notable Context Nov 2021 ~$69,000 (All-Time High) Peak of previous cycle, high institutional interest Nov 2022 ~$16,000 (Cycle Low) Post-FTX collapse, macro risk-off environment Q1 2025 >$91,000 (Current) New cycle high, matured regulatory landscape Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Market analysts emphasize the difference between speculative spikes and sustainable growth. Many point to the changed underlying infrastructure compared to previous bull markets. The investor base is now more diversified, including: Long-term holders (HODLers): Entities with multi-year investment horizons. Corporate Treasuries: Public companies adding BTC to balance sheets. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs): Providing regulated access for a wider audience. Nation-State Entities: Some countries have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This diversity can potentially reduce volatility over time. Experts from firms like Fidelity Digital Assets and CoinShares often reference on-chain data, such as the percentage of supply that hasn’t moved in over a year, as a measure of conviction. Their analysis suggests the current rally is supported by strong fundamentals, not merely hype. However, they universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Potential Impacts and Future Trajectory The breach of $91,000 has immediate and longer-term implications. In the short term, it tests liquidity and can trigger algorithmic trading strategies. It also brings psychological price targets, like $100,000, into clearer view for market participants. For the broader digital asset ecosystem, a strong Bitcoin often acts as a rising tide, lifting other projects. Nevertheless, capital rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins is a dynamic that seasoned traders monitor closely. From a global finance perspective, Bitcoin’s performance challenges traditional asset correlations. Its behavior during periods of currency devaluation or equity market stress is a subject of ongoing study. Regulatory bodies worldwide are undoubtedly observing this price action as they continue to formulate frameworks for digital asset oversight. The network’s security, measured by its hash rate, typically strengthens during price rallies as mining becomes more profitable, creating a positive feedback loop for the protocol’s integrity. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $91,000 marks a definitive chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This Bitcoin price achievement reflects a complex interplay of technological adoption, macroeconomic forces, and shifting investor demographics. While the path forward will inevitably include volatility, the current milestone underscores the asset’s growing resilience and its cemented role in the global discussion about money, value, and sovereignty. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this level consolidates as a new support zone for the next phase of growth. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price reported in this surge? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring data cited on April 2, 2025, BTC was trading at $91,188.55 on the Binance USDT market when it rose above the $91,000 level. Q2: Why is breaking the $91,000 level significant for Bitcoin? Surpassing $91,000 represents a new cycle high, demonstrating strong buyer conviction and overcoming previous psychological and technical resistance levels. It establishes a new benchmark price for the asset in its current market phase. Q3: What are some common factors that drive a major Bitcoin price increase? Major rallies are often driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional adoption, favorable macroeconomic conditions (like inflation concerns), regulatory developments, technological upgrades to the network, and broader shifts in global risk sentiment. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s current price compare to its all-time high? The all-time high for Bitcoin prior to this move was approximately $69,000, reached in November 2021. The move above $91,000 therefore represents a new record high, surpassing the previous peak by a significant margin. Q5: Does a high Bitcoin price affect the rest of the cryptocurrency market? Historically, a strong Bitcoin price often has a positive effect on the broader cryptocurrency market, a phenomenon known as the “halo effect.” It can increase overall market capitalization, improve sentiment, and attract new capital into the digital asset space. However, capital sometimes rotates between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

In a post shared on X, one trader said he made $80,000 overnight using Polymarket by tracking signals tied to US military activity. The trader pointed out that the United States had moved its largest aircraft carrier earlier on, which convinced him a strike on Venezuela was coming. The only unknown was timing, so he built a simple bot to watch Domino’s pizza orders around the Pentagon, a pattern long linked to late-night government work. The trader wrote , “The moment the pizza indicator bot spotted an unusual activity, I was alerted on my phone and immediately purchased as many ‘Will the US strike Venzuela’ shares on Polymarket. GG and thanks for playing.” Early hours of the morning, Trump confirmed the strike on Truth Social, saying the United States had carried out a large-scale operation against Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow. There will be a News Conference today at 11 A.M., at Mar-a-Lago,” said Trump. B ets land before Trump confirms capture of Nicolás Maduro By the time Trump spoke , Polymarket positions were already deep in profit. A newly created Polymarket account had invested more than $30,000 on Maduro’s exit from power. After US forces took him into custody overnight, the trader walked away with about $400,000 in under 24 hours. Polymarket bets on Trump’s Venezuela strikes. Source: X/Polymarket On prediction markets, insider trading is allowed. Traders openly act on private analysis and public signals tied to geopolitical events involving Venezuela. Prediction markets have recently drawn scrutiny from regulators. Gaming commissions across the United States argue some platforms act like unlicensed sportsbooks. Sports contracts on Kalshi and Polymarket have grown quickly. Kalshi ended a long legal fight with the Commodity Futures and Exchange Commission in 2025, but that calm ended when state gaming commissions began sending cease-and-desist letters. Crypto and oil markets react as regulators circle prediction platforms Trump later said at a press conference that the United States would temporarily run Venezuela during a transition period. He said the goal was to get oil production moving again. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country,” Trump said. He added, “They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been.” Hours after Maduro’s capture, senior figures from his government condemned the military operation and warned against US involvement. Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s chosen vice president, whom Trump said was sworn in on Saturday, called the capture “barbaric” and an “illegal and illegitimate kidnapping.” She said it was an attack on the sovereignty of Venezuela and called for the “immediate release” of Maduro and his wife, saying he remained “the only president of Venezuela.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters at Mar-a-Lago and said Maduro had chances to avoid arrest. “Nicolás Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this. He was provided multiple very, very, very generous offers, and chose instead to act like a wild man.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged back above $91,000 as more than $60 million in leveraged short positions were wiped out in one hour after prices increased around $3,000 from lows seen after the US began strikes on Venezuela. Trump linked Maduro’s removal to oil supply. He said Venezuela holds roughly 300 billion barrels of oil, the largest reserves in the world, more than Saudi Arabia. “We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,” Trump said. He added that the oil embargo he imposed remains “in full effect.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|Kalshi|Polymarket|Venezuela,BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

While recent technical improvements suggest momentum is turning in favor of the bulls, key resistance levels remain overhead, which means the recovery seems promising, but not yet fully confirmed. Market Structure Remains Unconvincing Despite The Bounce In a recent market update, crypto analyst Luca expressed a cautious outlook regarding Ethereum’s current market structure. While the price has managed a technical feat by breaking above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a zone that has historically served as a reliable reversal point over the past several months, Luca remains unconvinced of a broader trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Momentum Rolls Over, Bearish Move Warning The primary hurdle for a definitive bullish reversal lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI), currently positioned at $3,120. Luca emphasizes that Ethereum must durably reclaim this level to shift the lower-timeframe sentiment. Until this specific price target is secured as support, the risk of the current move being a fake-out remains high. Drawing parallels to the current state of Bitcoin, Luca suggests that the most prudent approach for investors is to remain defensive, as the market has yet to confirm a breakout above the Fibonacci resistance. This cautious stance is intended to guard against emotional trading during a period of high uncertainty and potential volatility. To manage this risk, Luca is maintaining a cash reserve to hedge spot holdings in case a rejection occurs. A failure to hold current levels would likely trigger a deeper pullback toward the previous high-timeframe resistance range near $2,700 before a more sustainable and durable reversal to the upside unfolds. Ethereum Opens 2026 With A Key Trend Shift According to StockTrader_max, Ethereum has started 2026 on a clearly positive technical footing. ETH has printed its first daily close above the 50-day moving average since October 9, a period that coincided with the liquidation-driven shock that rippled through the broader crypto market. This close marks a meaningful shift in trend behavior after months of trading below key short-term averages. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Presses Resistance, but Can The Recovery Survive? From a bullish perspective, reclaiming the 50-day MA is exactly the kind of confirmation sought for following an extended corrective phase. It signals improving momentum and suggests that buyers are beginning to regain control, potentially laying the groundwork for a more sustained recovery rather than a short-lived bounce. Looking ahead, StockTrader_max highlighted the 200-day moving average around $3,550 as the next major upside objective. As capital starts to rotate back into Ethereum and risk appetite improves, the analyst expects price action to gravitate toward this level in the coming sessions.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-under-2-is-a-great-blessing-heres-why/,timestabloid,"A prominent financial educator within the XRP community has described XRP’s current valuation below $2 as an exceptional long-term opportunity, framing the present market environment as favorable for strategic positioning rather than short-term concern. His remarks reflect a broader sentiment among long-term holders who believe XRP’s current price does not adequately reflect its intended role in future financial systems. Long-Term Positioning Over Short-Term Price Action Coach JV, a widely recognized finance coach and digital asset commentator, recently shared his perspective on XRP’s current market price. According to him, XRP trading below $2 represents a rare opportunity for patient investors who are focused on long-term outcomes rather than short-term volatility. He disclosed that he continues to increase his exposure at current levels, suggesting confidence that broader adoption and institutional integration have not yet been fully reflected in market pricing. XRP under $2.00 is one of the greatest blessings of our lifetime. I am still accumulating. My top crypto holdings: XRP Bitcoin WLFI Solana XLM HBAR VET My top two stocks: ABTC XXI Cash-value life insurance is the foundation of my family’s wealth empire. Cash flow is the… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 1, 2026 Rather than emphasizing daily price fluctuations, his commentary centers on delayed valuation recognition. From his viewpoint, XRP’s use case within cross-border payments and financial infrastructure positions it for future relevance, regardless of temporary market weakness. This approach contrasts with the frustration expressed by some investors who remain focused on near-term performance. Investment Strategy Anchored in Conviction Beyond his stance on XRP, Coach JV has openly discussed the structure of his broader investment portfolio. Within digital assets, his largest positions include XRP, Bitcoin, Solana, XLM, HBAR, VET, and WLFI. This allocation highlights a preference for assets tied to infrastructure development, liquidity, and long-term utility rather than speculative trends. In traditional markets, he identified American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) and Twenty One Capital (XXI) as key equity holdings. Both companies operate as crypto treasury-focused firms, reinforcing his emphasis on exposure to businesses aligned with digital asset accumulation and long-term balance sheet strategies. Collectively, these choices reflect a consistent investment thesis centered on durability and strategic alignment rather than short-term returns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Structure and Financial Discipline A recurring theme in Coach JV’s commentary is the importance of financial systems over reactive decision-making. He has repeatedly stated that long-term success depends on disciplined frameworks rather than frequent trading or emotional responses to market movements. According to him, sustainable wealth is built through predictable cash flow, controlled risk exposure, and intentional asset allocation. He has highlighted tools such as cash-value life insurance as part of his family’s long-term financial planning, alongside maintaining minimal personal debt and evaluating investments through the lens of inflation protection. This structured approach resonates with XRP supporters who view extended periods of low prices as opportunities to strengthen their positions within a broader financial plan. Broader Bullish Sentiment Within the XRP Community Coach JV’s outlook aligns with similar views expressed by other well-known XRP commentators. In recent months, Alex Cobb has also argued that XRP trading below $2 represents a significant valuation disconnect. Cobb has pointed to multiple developments that could support future price appreciation, including upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States. One frequently cited catalyst is the scheduled markup of the CLARITY Act in January 2026, which many industry participants believe could encourage increased institutional participation in crypto markets. Additionally, demand for spot XRP exchange-traded funds has continued to grow, with assets under management now totaling approximately $1.16 billion. Corporate interest in XRP treasury strategies has also increased, with firms such as VivoPower and Wellgistics Health announcing plans to hold XRP as a long-term reserve asset. Supporters argue that sustained institutional accumulation, combined with regulatory progress, could create conditions favorable for long-term price expansion. Taken together, these views reflect a shared belief that XRP’s current market value does not fully capture its long-term potential. For investors who prioritize disciplined planning and extended time horizons, XRP’s sub-$2 price is seen not as a signal of failure, but as an opportunity to build exposure ahead of broader adoption cycles.

This record has been achieved almost two years after the introduction of these crypto ETFs in January 2024. To back this claim, data from a reliable source noted that the $2 trillion achievement was reached on January 2. In comparison, analysts found that the cumulative trading volume reached an all-time high of approximately $1 trillion, recorded on May 6, 2025. This milestone was achieved about 16 months after the launch of the ETFs. Notably, the surge from $1 trillion to $2 trillion took approximately eight months. This duration is half the time consumed to attain the first trillion. Hence, the situation demonstrates a heightened interest from institutions seeking regulated investments in cryptocurrency-related assets. Crypto ETFs demonstrate outstanding net inflows US-based spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs opened 2026 with strong momentum, recording nearly $646 million in combined net inflows on the first trading day despite uneven sentiment across the wider crypto market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $471.3 million in net inflows on Friday, while spot Ether ETFs added $174.5 million, lifting total inflows to $645.8 million, according to data from Farside. The inflow marked the strongest single day for US spot Bitcoin ETFs in 35 trading sessions, the largest since Nov. 11, when the 11 funds collectively drew $524 million. Spot Ether ETFs also logged their biggest one-day inflow in 15 trading days, the highest since Dec. 9, when inflows reached $177.7 million. The current cumulative volume encompasses a broader range of assets. To further clarify this point for better understanding, they mentioned that firms introduced spot ETFs that can effectively track Solana, XRP , Dogecoin, Litecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink shortly after new generic listing standards received the green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 17, 2025. Following this approval, reports highlighted that the agency decided to reduce approval times from 240 days to 75 days. Meanwhile, among the listed new offerings, XRP-based products secured ranking among the most outperformed, generating about $1.2 billion in net inflows since they began operating on November 13. On the other hand, a review from a reliable source declared that Bitcoin ETFs experienced approximately $21.8 billion in net inflows while other ETFs encountered about $9.8 billion in net inflows. In the case of BlackRock’s IBIT , it was confirmed that the spot bitcoin ETF owns approximately 70% of the market share by volume with more than $66 billion in assets under management (AUM). This finding was noted after its volume share hit a high level of 80% in mid-2025. James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, weighed in on the situation. He acknowledged that the authorities have approved several crypto ETF filings. However, Seyffart affirmed that there are at least 126 more of these filings pending approval. Nonetheless, he warned that some may halt their operations if they fail to draw in sufficient steady investments. As the situation becomes more intense, data from SoSoValue claimed that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs showed significant outcomes at the beginning of the new year on January 2. It is worth noting that this date represented the first trading day of 2026. BlackRock’s IBIT secures the top ranking in net inflows The net inflows of Spot Bitcoin ETFs totaled approximately $471.1 million, with all twelve funds experiencing a surge in positive investments. BlackRock’s IBIT ranks first with $287.4 million. The second on the list was Fidelity’s FBTC, with approximately $88.1 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB, with about $41.5 million. As of now, the Bitcoin ETF assets amount to approximately $117.0 billion, accounting for 6.53% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at around $90,602.99, reflecting a 0.73% increase in the past 24 hours, according to reports from CoinMarketCap . In the meantime, Spot Ethereum ETFs generated approximately $174.4 million, with Grayscale’s ETHE leading the way at $53.7 million, followed by Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust at $50.0 million, and BlackRock’s ETHA at $47.2 million. Analysts stated that Ethereum’s total assets reached an all-time high of $19.1 billion, equivalent to 5.06% of the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,133.44, representing a 0.16% increase over the past 24 hours. Get seen where it counts.

Experts Weigh In,https://timestabloid.com/where-will-xrp-go-in-2026-experts-weigh-in/,timestabloid,"As the digital asset market turns the page on a challenging 2025, discussion has intensified around where major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, could be headed in 2026. Commentary from industry figures highlighted by Digital Perspectives founder Brad Kimes has contributed to an optimistic narrative. The video Kimes shared included insights from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos, shaping expectations for 2026 . Crypto Market Closed 2025 Below Its Peak Despite beginning 2025 with strong momentum, the cryptocurrency market struggled to sustain those gains. Market capitalization reached a record level of approximately $4.27 trillion in early October, only to reverse sharply in the final quarter. By year-end, total market value had declined to about $2.93 trillion, representing a significant retreat from its peak and an overall annual loss of roughly $250 billion. This performance reflected a year-over-year decline of 7.85%. XRP- Where Will Crypto & XRP Go in 2026? – XRP Charts? (includes paid promotion) pic.twitter.com/6jPjub2Ehq — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) December 28, 2025 XRP mirrored the broader market’s downturn, finishing 2025 with a loss of almost 12%. However, early indicators in 2026 suggest a shift in sentiment , as analysts reassess the structural forces influencing digital assets and reconsider long-standing assumptions about market cycles. Bitwise CIO Questions the Traditional Crypto Cycle Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan challenged the relevance of the traditional four-year crypto cycle , arguing it no longer drives market behavior. He said the industry may now be entering a longer-term growth phase shaped by new structural forces. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hougan pointed to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory developments, and the expanding use of stablecoins and tokenization as lasting demand drivers. While cycle thinking still affects sentiment, he expects 2026 to deliver steady gains, lower volatility, and more normalized price action. Hougan also noted that institutional adoption remains slow. He stated that firms such as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and more approved Bitcoin products well after ETF launches due to lengthy internal processes. This delay helps explain the uneven market action observed over the past year. Inversion CEO Expresses Confidence in XRP’s Potential Kimes also referenced comments from Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos. Santos shared a notably bullish view on XRP during a recent Empire podcast episode. He argued that the asset has a credible path back to its all-time high . He believes it is more likely to do so than the other top 10 cryptos, even with weak market conditions. He contrasted this optimism with a more pessimistic outlook on Ethereum, questioning its valuation and product direction. According to Santos, Ethereum’s market capitalization lacks sufficient justification. However, XRP’s lower valuation gives Ripple greater flexibility to deploy its native asset. He emphasized Ripple’s ability to use XRP for expansion, acquisitions, and to strengthen its ecosystem over time.

Blockchain tracking data shows that the world’s largest asset manager expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by more than $23 billion in 2025, and this is one of the biggest institutional accumulation phases seen in the year. The figures highlight a sustained commitment to Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as price action turned bearish towards the end of the year. BlackRock’s Crypto Portfolio Expansion Through 2025 Crypto was at the forefront of BlackRock’s investment strategy in 2025. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock’s on-chain cryptocurrency holdings at the start of 2025 were $54.83 billion. By January 1, 2026, that figure had risen to about $78.36 billion, representing a net increase of roughly $23.52 billion over the course of the year. These figures mean that by the end of 2025, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio had grown by about 43% compared to the start of the year. Unsurprisingly, the accumulation was concentrated almost entirely in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest assets leading institutional exposure to the crypto industry. Bitcoin was the dominant holding by value. BlackRock’s BTC stash grew from around 552,550 BTC worth about $51.16 billion in January 2025 to about 770,290 BTC valued at $68.05 billion in January 2026. This translates to an increase of approximately 217,740 BTC, adding about $16.88 billion to the firm’s portfolio based on year-end valuations. Even with Bitcoin’s price down about 5% from January 2025, the increase in BTC units held grew by 39%, which, in turn, pushed the total value higher. Ethereum, although smaller in absolute terms, saw even faster relative growth. Holdings expanded from 1.07 million ETH valued at $3.59 billion in January 2025 to about 3.47 million ETH worth $10.31 billion in January 2026. That represents an increase of nearly 2.4 million ETH, contributing around $6.71 billion to BlackRock’s crypto holdings in 2025. These numbers mean that BlackRock’s ETH holdings grew by more than 224% over the year, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 39% increase. ETFs And Institutional Demand Motivated $23 Billion Accumulation The bulk of BlackRock’s crypto buying in 2025 was due to persistent inflows into its spot exchange-traded products. Investor demand for regulated exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum was strong for much of the year, particularly during rallies that pushed both assets toward fresh all-time highs. At the same time, corrective phases in the crypto market were accompanied by notable ETF outflows. This trend supports the view that Bitcoin and Ethereum price action is becoming increasingly linked to ETF activity, and BlackRock is the dominant issuer within those flows. BlackRock has not yet established a presence in the XRP market. The asset manager does not currently offer a Spot XRP ETF, and spokespersons have previously stated that the company has no immediate plans to launch one.

Vitalik compared Ethereum’s situation to peer-to-peer networks that came long before it, like “BitTorrent (2000): huge total bandwidth, highly decentralized, no consensus.” Ethereum starts large gas limit increases in 2026 through BALs and ePBS Vitalik then pointed to Bitcoin in 2009, saying:- “Bitcoin (2009): highly decentralized, consensus, but low bandwidth because it’s not “distributed” in the sense of work being split up, it’s replicated. Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and high bandwidth. But now it’s time to talk about what this combination means for Ethereum.” Vitalik said these upgrades are already running code, not theory. Data availability sampling is active on mainnet today. zk-EVMs already hit production performance levels. Safety checks are the final step, and Vitalik traced that work back ten years, starting with his first data availability research commit and later zk-EVM experiments that began around 2020. The rollout plan is staged. In 2026, Ethereum expects large gas limit increases that do not depend on zk-EVMs, driven by BALs and ePBS. That same year should also bring the first chances to run a zk-EVM node on parts of the network, according to Vitalik. From 2027 through 2030, Ethereum plans even larger gas limit jumps as zk-EVMs become the main block validation method. “ZKEVM becomes the primary way to validate blocks on the network,” Vitalik wrote. Another piece is distributed block building. Vitalik said the long-term goal is a setup where a full block is never built in one place. He said this is not urgent, but worth building toward. In Vitalik’s words:- “Even before that point, we want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed as possible. This can be done either in-protocol (eg. maybe we figure out how to expand FOCIL to make it a primary channel for txs), or out-of-protocol with distributed builder marketplaces. This reduces risk of centralized interference with real-time transaction inclusion.” Vitalik said that it also improves geographic fairness. The Ethereum Foundation has it stated on its website that higher gas limits on Ethereum are made safe by zk-EVMs increase capacity, cut congestion, and stabilize fees. The Foundation said :- “Bringing zkEVMs to L1 is a multi-faceted effort. Our work is organized into three core workstreams, with parallel progress on client implementations.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Bitcoin remains above $91,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens rose to over $3.11 trillion. This article highlights some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Ethena (ENA), Jito (JTO), Pump (PUMP), and Pi Network (PI). Ethena to unlock millions of tokens Ethena, a cryptocurrency valued at over $1.8 billion, will be one of the top coins to watch this week. It will unlock 171 million tokens, currently valued at over $41 million on Sunday. This unlock comes as the unlock progress stands at 51.9%. Ethena token has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.1935 in December to the current $0.2400. It still remains about 72% below the highest point in 2025, a decline that mirrors that of other cryptocurrencies . ENA has seen intense buying by Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMex, who has accumulated tokens worth over $3.8 million even as the total value locked has slumped to $6.4 billion from last year’s high of $14.3 billion. Jito token in focus ahead of a big token unlock Jito, a major player in the Solana ecosystem, is another top crypto to watch this week as it unlocks 11.3 million tokens worth over $5.39 million, which is equivalent with 1.14% of its market cap. Like Ethena, Jito has a long way to go in terms of its token unlocks as it has unlocked just 37.28% of its tokens. Jito’s TVL, which is made up of staked Solana tokens, has dropped from last year’s high of $3.37 billion to the current $1.9 billion. Other cryptocurrencies with large unlocks this week are Movement (MOVE), Rain (RAIN), Linea (LINEA), Pump, and Gods Unchained. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum price has rebounded in the past few days, moving to a high of $3,150, its highest level since December 12. It has jumped by 20% from its lowest level in November last year. The token will be in the spotlight this week as investors watch the ongoing trends in the ETF market. Spot Ethereum ETFs added over $160 million in inflows last week, a big improvement from the previous week’s outflows of $102 million. They had shed over $643 million in assets a week earlier. Spot Ethereum ETFs now hold over $19 billion in assets, which are equivalent to 5% of its market capitalization. Ethereum price will also be in focus as BitMine continues to invest and stake it. The company has now accumulated tokens worth over $12 billion and has started staking them. It will also announce its financial results on Friday. Pi Network (PI) Chart shows that Pi Network price moved above the upper side of the falling wedge Pi Network token has held steady in the past few days. It has remained at the key support at $0.200, its highest level since December 20th. The main reason it will be in the spotlight is that, as the chart above shows, it has moved slightly above the upper side of the falling wedge pattern. As such, there is a likelihood that this could lead to more upside in the near term. Pi Network will unlock over 36 million tokens worth over $7. 2 million as part of its daily tokens. Also, traders will likely watch the developments on the ongoing DEX and AMM testnet.

Thus, the cryptocurrency added almost three grand since the attacks began from bottom to top before it retraced slightly to around $91,300 as of press time.

Two of the tokens linked to the US President, WLFI and TRUMP, are among the biggest gainers, with the former skyrocketing by 14%, while the latter is up by nearly 7%. Given the consequences of the attack and the fact that Trump said the US will run the Venezuela oil industry for now, analysts expect further volatility on Sunday at 6 PM ET when the oil futures open in some markets. The Kobeissi Letter explained that Venezuela has over 300 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which will reportedly be under US control. With oil prices at $57 per barrel, this would put the country’s total reserves at $17.3 trillion. The analysts added that even if the US sells this oil for half the market rate, the value of $8.7 trillion would be larger than the GDP of all countries except China and the US. Consequently, they noted that “most people do not realize how much the world just changed,” and warned that more volatility is expected once financial markets, especially oil, open for trading. This is absolutely insane: Venezuela currently has 303 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which Trump says the US now controls. Oil prices are trading at ~$57/barrel, making Venezuela’s total reserves worth $17.3 TRILLION.

Key Takeaways: Hut 8 expanded its Coinbase credit line to $200M to support its AI and HPC push. A $7B Fluidstack deal makes Hut 8 a long-term power supplier for AI data centers. Strong stock gains and a large BTC treasury set Hut 8 apart from struggling miners. The amended facility, disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, will be used for “general corporate purposes.” T he expansion builds on Hut 8’s strong momentum through 2025, a period when many Bitcoin miners struggled with compressed margins and rising costs. Hut 8’s $7B AI Deal With Fluidstack Powers Major Data Center Push The credit increase follows a landmark $7 billion agreement signed in December with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. Under the deal, Hut 8 will supply 245 megawatts of energy over 15 years to power a large-scale AI data center, marking one of the largest partnerships between a crypto-native firm and an AI infrastructure company. Hut 8’s strategic pivot has been rewarded by markets. The company’s shares have risen more than 134% over the past year and are trading around $51, according to Yahoo Finance. The rally sets Hut 8 apart from much of the mining sector, which has faced sustained pressure since the April 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Beyond AI, Hut 8 has continued to expand its Bitcoin mining and treasury strategy. Through its majority ownership of American Bitcoin, a mining and crypto treasury company, the firm has increased exposure to Bitcoin at a time when many peers have been forced to sell holdings to cover operating costs. JUST IN: #Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 just announced it partnered with Google for financial backing on a 15-year lease. Bullish pic.twitter.com/NQN9JmW0ob — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2025 Industry-wide challenges have included higher energy prices and macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as rising equipment costs linked to US tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump. The measures have heightened concerns over supply chains, particularly given China’s role as a major producer of application-specific integrated circuits used in Bitcoin mining. Despite those headwinds, Hut 8 remains one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The company ranks ninth among Bitcoin treasury firms, with 13,696 BTC worth more than $1.2 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.Net. American Bitcoin ranks twentieth, holding 5,098 BTC valued at roughly $458 million. Bitmain Slashes Bitcoin Miner Prices as Industry Pressure Mounts As reported, Bitmain is cutting prices aggressively across multiple generations of Bitcoin mining hardware as pressure builds across the mining sector, according to recent promotional campaigns and internal price lists circulated to customers. One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines. Shipments for that batch are scheduled to begin in January 2026, suggesting Bitmain is willing to lock in low pricing well ahead of delivery. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hashrate fell 4% in the month through Dec. 15, a development that could set the stage for stronger price performance in the months ahead, according to analysts at VanEck. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote.

After blaming the country’s officials for certain drug operations, the US military bombed its capital, Caracas, and arrested its leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife. In his first interview and address to the nation after the attacks, US President Donald Trump claimed that his country will now run the oil industry in Venezuela, which reportedly has over 300 billion barrels of oil, valued at more than $17 trillion at market prices. One of the statements he made caused even more controversy as he claimed that he didn’t tell Congress about the military operation, as it would have leaked. The democrats used this opportunity to criticize Trump’s actions, including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, who called the attacks “reckless.” He also warned that any plan for the US to run Venezuela should “strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.” He added that the Trump administration had denied pursuing regime change or military action, which was evidently not the case. Some reports indicated later that the Trump impeachment odds reached a new all-time high on prediction platforms such as Kalshi. However, a closer look at the charts today actually shows a different story. The odds on both Kalshi and Polymarket have declined slightly since the start of the year on almost all scales (by June 1, 2026, January 1, 2027, and January 1, 2028). The chances for an impeachment by December 31, 2026, on Polymarket have declined by 3% since the attacks took place. Trump Impeachment Odds on Polymarket Interestingly, the attacks against Venezuela have impacted the two largest cryptocurrencies linked to the US President. Aside from BTC jumping past $91,000 for the first time since mid-December, WLFI has skyrocketed by more than 16% on a daily scale to almost $0.18. TRUMP has returned to the top 100 alts, soaring 7.5% to $5.40.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin held near $90K despite a major US–Venezuela military escalation that dominated headlines. BTC staying above its 21-day moving average signals short-term support and potential January upside. Analysts warn volatility could rise once institutional traders return when US markets reopen. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000 in early trading before recovering, showing limited reaction to an event that dominated global headlines. “The US bombed a country and captured its leader, on a weekend no less, and yet Bitcoin has barely moved,” said Nic Puckrin , founder of crypto media firm Coin Bureau, in a post on X. Bitcoin’s Calm Amid Geopolitical Shock Puts Focus on Key Support Level The muted response stood out in a market where risk assets often see sharp sell-offs during geopolitical crises. From a technical perspective, analysts point to encouraging signals. Michaël van de Poppe noted that Bitcoin remains above its 21-day moving average, a level often viewed as short-term support. Holding above that threshold could open the door to further price gains in January, assuming broader market conditions remain stable. The resilience is notable given Bitcoin’s recent volatility. Historically, sudden geopolitical shocks or macroeconomic stress have triggered abrupt drawdowns in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. This time, the response has been restrained, at least so far. The situation stems from an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who confirmed airstrikes on Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. While the news sparked intense debate online, financial markets appeared largely unfazed over the weekend. Some analysts caution that the calm may not last. “There’s a lot of geopolitical tension, and next week the big players will return,” said crypto trader Lennaert Snyder, warning that volatility could increase once traditional markets reopen. Institutional investors typically sit out weekends, meaning reactions may still come when US markets open on Monday. $BTC has entered the weekend range.

After a flash crash in October, Bitcoin fell more than 30% from an all-time high above $125,000 to around $80,000 in November, before rebounding toward current levels. Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions. Barhydt said the US central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt.

According to Anderson, exchange-held XRP balances have fallen to levels not seen in seven years, dropping sharply from roughly 3.76 billion tokens recorded in October 2025 to around 1.6 billion currently. This contraction in readily available supply, he explained, alters the balance between liquidity and potential sell pressure and warrants closer examination as the market moves into 2026. BREAKING!! Why 1.6 Billion #XRP Just Vanished From Exchanges!? pic.twitter.com/qCL9hS9A27 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) January 2, 2026 Broader Market Context and Near-Term Structure Anderson first placed XRP within the wider digital asset landscape, noting that Bitcoin remains near the lower end of its recent trading range. While Bitcoin has shown signs of attempting a recovery toward the $90,000 area, Anderson emphasized that confirmation above key resistance levels would be necessary before a broader market rebound could be expected. Within this environment, he suggested that XRP appears to have completed its short-term downward phase, forming higher lows that could support a recovery toward previous local price levels if momentum continues. He also observed that overall crypto market capitalization has hovered around the $3 trillion mark, reflecting limited volatility during the holiday period. Despite short-term uncertainty, Anderson expressed the view that 2026 could be a constructive year for the sector, even if early market structure adjustments produce temporary weakness. Escrow Unlocks and Supply Dynamics Addressing concerns around Ripple’s scheduled escrow releases, Anderson described the January unlock of one billion XRP as a routine event rather than a market shock. He reiterated that such releases occur monthly and that a substantial portion, typically between 70 and 80%, is historically returned to escrow. In his assessment, price behavior following recent unlocks suggests that these events have not exerted meaningful downward pressure. Instead, Anderson argued that the more relevant development is the sustained reduction in exchange reserves. He noted that XRP held on exchanges has declined by more than half over the past three months, tightening available supply. If demand remains steady or increases under these conditions, he suggested that upward price pressure becomes more likely.

He referenced significant financing activity involving major financial players and emphasized that institutional stakeholders have a clear incentive to see long-term value appreciation. While cautioning against extreme price predictions, Anderson stressed that adoption trends, regulatory progress, and diminishing exchange supply are tangible indicators worth monitoring. In his view, these elements collectively suggest that XRP is positioned to benefit from institutional growth and evolving market infrastructure in 2026, even as short-term volatility remains part of the landscape.

56802467,https://invezz.com/?p=3019389,1767517200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,LATAM crypto news: Bitcoin travel expands in El Salvador as seniors lead digital wallet adoption in Argentina,https://invezz.com/news/2026/01/04/latam-crypto-news-bitcoin-travel-expands-in-el-salvador-as-seniors-lead-digital-wallet-adoption-in-argentina/,invezz,"This week’s most relevant crypto stories in Latin America highlight how digital assets are moving from speculation to everyday use. On one hand, Bitcoin-powered travel is gaining ground in El Salvador with the expansion of Airbtc, a booking platform built exclusively for BTC users and already showing strong local adoption. On the other hand, Argentina’s older adults are leading the region’s growth in digital wallet usage, proving that crypto and fintech adoption are accelerating across generations. Furthermore, Bitget Wallet ended 2025 with increased on-chain activity in trading, payments, and yield products, demonstrating that self-custodial wallets are becoming mainstream financial instruments rather than niche solutions for cryptocurrency traders. Together, these developments underscore a clear trend: crypto in LATAM is increasingly about real-world utility, inclusion, and economic transformation. Airbtc is a Bitcoin-only platform that is redefining travel Airbtc is a global booking platform where consumers can only pay with Bitcoin (BTC). The business, which launched in August 2024, operates similarly to Airbnb but is developed by and for bitcoiners. According to cofounder Jake Seifert, the platform already features properties across more than a dozen countries, with a strong presence in El Salvador. Destinations include El Zonte, San Salvador, Santa Ana, Berlín, Costa del Sol, and Punta Mango. Airbtc intends to improve the circular Bitcoin economy by making it easier for visitors to spend BTC in real-world circumstances. Airbtc presents itself as a decentralised alternative to existing booking platforms by eliminating financial intermediaries and charging lower prices. Guests can save up to 8%, and hosts can save up to 18% compared to services like Airbnb or Booking.com. Payments are held in cold storage until the stay is complete, after which they are released to hosts in BTC, either on-chain or over the Lightning Network. El Salvador accounts for around 15% of Airbtc’s global inventory, making it one of the biggest concentrations by nation, showing increased local interest in taking Bitcoin and the country’s favourable legislative climate for Bitcoin-focused enterprises. Seniors drive digital wallet adoption in Argentina Today, 3.3 million Argentinians over the age of 60, or 42% of the population, use a virtual wallet to access digital payments, transfers, and basic savings features. The data was published by the Argentine Fintech Chamber on December 29, citing Central Bank records that show retirees had the highest increase in digital payments and transfers over the previous year. While overall virtual wallet ownership increased by 13% between June 2024 and June 2025, use among those over 60 increased by 29.7%, more than doubling the norm. This growth suggests a deliberate transition rather than a gradual adoption. Older folks are increasingly using digital wallets for better convenience, security, and access to yields, reducing their need for currency. According to Invecq, seniors who use virtual wallets make up to 80% fewer cash withdrawals than those who just use bank accounts, contributing to a general decrease in cash usage across the economy. Beyond payments, wallets have become an important savings tool: 42% of retirees transfer funds to earn returns, and many advocate for the ability to collect and manage pensions in an increasingly digitised financial system. Bitget Wallet sees 2025 on-chain activity signal shift toward everyday crypto finance Bitget Wallet finished 2025 with increased on-chain activity in trading , payments, and yield products, indicating that self-custodial wallets are becoming mainstream financial instruments rather than specialist goods for crypto traders. The data show a gradual shift in user behaviour as adoption expanded beyond early, trading-focused audiences and into more ordinary financial use. The findings are based on internal data described in a press release sent to Invezz , which shows how wallet usage continued to rise even as broader crypto market activity slowed near the end of the year. The pattern indicates a gradual decoupling between market sentiment and real-world cryptocurrency usage, notably in areas related to payments and stablecoin-based activity. Trading activity on the blockchain increased significantly throughout 2025. Bitget Wallet’s monthly swap trading volume surpassed $900 million, representing a 232% increase over the previous year. Users increasingly depended on decentralised exchange routing to gain access to a wider range of assets across various blockchains, demonstrating a rising demand for on-chain liquidity and execution.

Meanwhile, a longer term channel chart still shows Bitcoin holding its multi year uptrend into early 2026. Bitcoin rebounds from New Year dip as Venezuela headlines hit risk appetite Bitcoin climbed back above $91,000 by Jan. 4 after a sharp New Year pullback pushed prices into the $87,000 area on the Bitstamp 1 hour chart. Price later held near $91,243 at the Jan. 4, 08:03 UTC snapshot, after topping out just under $92,000 and then moving sideways. Bitcoin U.S. Dollar 1 Hour Price Chart: Source: CoinCodex First, Bitcoin traded choppy into Dec. 31, then it sold off into the turn of the year. However, buyers stepped in quickly, and the market began building higher lows through Jan. 1 and Jan. 2. As a result, the chart shows a steady grind higher that carried Bitcoin back through $89,000 and $90,000. Then, volatility spiked around Jan. 2 and Jan. 3, with wider candles and heavier bursts of volume. This swing lined up with broader risk off behavior after headlines tied to a U.S. attack involving Venezuela. Still, Bitcoin stabilized after the initial drop, and it resumed its climb into Jan. 4, when it pushed into the low $91,000s and paused near resistance. Bitcoin holds long term rising channel as price trends toward upper range Bitcoin continues to trade inside a multi year rising channel that has guided price action since the 2018 cycle, according to a long term BTCUSD index chart shared by Trending Bitcoin on X. The chart shows Bitcoin rebounding from the lower boundary of the channel near the mid $80,000 area and then resuming its broader upward structure into early 2026. Bitcoin U.S. Dollar 1 Day Index Long Term Rising Channel Chart. Source: Trending Bitcoin on X (AO btc analyst) First, the chart highlights repeated reactions along the channel’s lower trendline across multiple market cycles. Each major drawdown since 2019 found support near that rising base before price rotated higher. This pattern repeated again in late 2025, when Bitcoin briefly slipped toward the lower channel range before stabilizing and turning upward. Then, Bitcoin pushed back above the mid channel zone, where price had previously consolidated during earlier expansion phases. That region acted as a pivot area rather than a reversal point, as buyers defended pullbacks and prevented deeper breakdowns. As a result, the structure remained intact despite short term volatility. Finally, the chart projects Bitcoin trending toward the upper boundary of the channel over the longer horizon. While the blue projection extends well beyond current price levels, the key takeaway remains the same. Bitcoin continues to respect the rising channel that has defined its long term market structure, keeping the broader trend intact as of early 2026.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Before implementing this move, it had alerted its users of this intention in a statement published on December 31, 2025. Notably, the firm adopted this decision the same year it received approval to begin its operations in the country. This sudden decision prompted reporters to contact the firm’s representatives for comment. The spokespersons claimed that they had embraced this move after conducting a review of their performance in the local markets. They added that, “This is a thoughtful pause that allows us to rethink and improve our strategy so we can come back with a stronger and more sustainable product.” Coinbase decides to halt its operation in Argentina In Argentina, Coinbase focused on key aspects of its regional plans in 2024, developing strategies to enter the market effectively. In January 2025, the company officially announced the launch of its local operations. Following the current situation, several individuals raised concerns about Coinbase’s sudden decision, with the main question raised in the ecosystem being, “What does this current pause mean?” In an attempt to answer this question, Coinbase released a statement intended for its users in Argentina. The statement noted that users in the country will no longer be able to access the exchange to purchase or sell the stablecoin USDC using Argentine pesos, the local currency, beginning January 31, 2026. However, it did not disclose the reason behind this decision. Another thing that the exchange unveiled was that cryptocurrency transactions, such as sending and receiving, will still be accessible to users. To silence the controversy raised in the ecosystem, Coinbase informed the press that it still values Argentina as a crucial market for new ideas. Following this claim, the firm made it clear its intentions to revive its operations in the nation in the future with an enhanced user experience. The Coinbase team asserted that they seek to achieve their firm’s goal of improving economic freedom by linking the world through blockchain technology. With this goal in mind, Latin America remains a key area of focus. As discussions continued among individuals, several analysts weighed in on the situation. They pointed out that although Coinbase adopted this move, the decision comes at a time when Argentina has solidified its position as a hub for cryptocurrencies. To support this claim, reports indicate that both local and global firms have recently shown a heightened interest in the Argentine market. For instance, Ripio launched the local peso-pegged stablecoin. Nexo, on the other hand, acquired the Buenbit exchange as part of its long-standing aim to expand. An unexpected power outage in Argentina raises concerns among individuals Apart from Coinbase, reports revealed that Bitfarms , a popular Bitcoin mining firm, also halted its Bitcoin mining operations in Argentina, based in Rio Cuarto. The company alleged that the reason behind this decision was an unexpected power outage from its local energy supplier. This information was published in Bitfarms’ earnings report for the first quarter. In this report, the firm noted that the power supply interruption began on May 12. It resulted from Generación Mediterránea S.A. (GMSA), the company responsible for providing this electricity supply to Bitfarms in Argentina. The outage occurred shortly after GMSA notified Bitfarms regarding matters related to a financial reorganization process with creditors. At this particular moment, sources highlighted that the team initially vowed to continue offering power supply to the mining company. Meanwhile, Bitfarms argued that this interruption has caused growing uncertainties concerning when or if power will be restored. Due to these uncertainties, the firm began exploring various alternatives to support operations at the facility. It is worth noting that Bitfarms’ operations in Argentina generated approximately $6.9 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2025. This figure contributed approximately 10% of the firm’s total revenue, which amounted to $66.8 million during this period. In their report, Bitfarms stated that this outage incident left them with no other choice but to halt their cryptocurrency mining operations based in Argentina. After making this claim, the company warned that this situation could significantly impact their operations if not resolved.

Interestingly, BTC started to regain traction once the US confirmed it carried out a successful military mission in Venezuela and captured its president. Hours later, after Trump addressed the nation, bitcoin climbed even further and neared $92,000 earlier this morning for the first time since mid-December. It was stopped there, but still trades above $91,000, which represents a 4.2% weekly increase. For now, its market capitalization has surged to $1.825 trillion.

A convergence of corporate moves, institutional accumulation, regulatory developments, and shifting market structure has thrust Bitcoin back into the spotlight, reaffirming its role as the bellwether of the digital asset market. Several major developments are driving the surge in Bitcoin chatter. Bitfarms’ decision to sell a Paraguay mining site for up to $30 million highlights strategic capital reallocation as miners adapt to post-halving economics and rising cost pressures. Meanwhile, Tether has become the fifth-largest Bitcoin holder, amassing roughly $8.42 billion in BTC, underscoring growing institutional-scale confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. Regulatory and market infrastructure shifts are further fueling Bitcoin’s momentum. South Korea’s largest crypto exchange is reportedly laying the groundwork for Bitcoin ETFs, even as regulatory approvals lag, underscoring mounting global pressure to fold Bitcoin into mainstream financial products. In the U.S., spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $348 million toward the end of 2025. While seemingly bearish, analysts view these flows as routine portfolio rebalancing rather than a weakening of long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Price action and trading dynamics are further fueling the hype. Bitcoin has seen sharp intraday swings, surging trading volumes, and heightened options activity, especially around major contract expiries that tend to amplify short-term volatility. With BTC trading near $91,428, market momentum remains firmly in focus. On X, formerly Twitter, discourse is dominated by Bitcoin’s recent performance, increasingly bullish 2026 outlooks, narratives of institutional accumulation, and comparisons with traditional assets like gold and equities, reinforcing an overall strongly bullish market sentiment. Beyond Bitcoin, several altcoins are capturing market attention. PEPE (PEPE) is surging with volatile price swings and skyrocketing trading volumes typical of meme-driven tokens. Ethereum (ETH) hovers near $3,000, buoyed by institutional inflows, active smart contract deployment, and strong network activity. Dogecoin (DOGE) dominates social chatter, with debates over its market performance and long-term potential. Solana (SOL) trends on discussions of staking, ecosystem growth, and its role as a high-performance blockchain. Conclusion Bitcoin top weekend discussions, driven by major institutional moves, regulatory shifts, and heightened volatility, while the broader crypto market balances speculation with innovation. Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, PEPE, and Dogecoin attract attention through network activity and social momentum, but Bitcoin remains the key market barometer. This weekend’s trends suggest that, despite short-term swings, strong investor interest and strategic positioning could set the stage for a bullish start to 2026, highlighting both opportunities and risks in an interconnected crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In this context, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of a significant price move as it continues to compress within a well-defined symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart, a structure that often precedes sharp volatility. According to market analysis highlighted by Ali Martinez in an X post on January 4, the ongoing consolidation points to a potential breakout of around 15%, bringing a decisive move into focus for traders and investors. The outlook indicates that the asset is trading within a tightening range, reflecting declining volatility and growing market indecision, conditions that typically resolve with a strong directional move once the price breaks out. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ali Martinez The upper resistance trendline currently caps price action just below the $91,000–$92,000 zone, while rising support has held above the $86,800 area. A confirmed breakout above the descending resistance would imply a measured move of roughly 15%, placing Bitcoin near or above the psychologically important $100,000 level. Such a move would likely be reinforced by momentum traders re-entering the market after the prolonged consolidation period. Conversely, a breakdown below the ascending support would open the door to a corrective move toward the low $80,000s, though current price action favors an upside test. Bitcoin moves past $90,000 It is worth noting that Bitcoin rallied above the $91,000 mark on Sunday as risk appetite improved across the broader cryptocurrency market , extending the early 2026 rebound in major digital assets. The advance was fueled in part by a sharp liquidation event that flushed out crowded positions and reset near-term leverage. Roughly $180 million in futures positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with short positions accounting for about $133 million. This imbalance suggests many traders were positioned against the move, triggering forced buybacks as prices climbed. Geopolitical developments also contributed to the rally. Fast-moving headlines out of Venezuela added to market volatility and encouraged risk-taking, reinforcing the upward push in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $91,460, up about 2% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly basis, BTC is up more than 4%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As things stand, Bitcoin is trading above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ), with the price around $91,555 compared with the 50-day SMA near $90,018, indicating that short- to medium-term momentum remains constructive. However, the price remains well below the 200-day SMA at roughly $99,664, suggesting the broader trend has yet to fully turn bullish and that overhead resistance remains significant. The 14-day RSI stands at 56.48, placing Bitcoin in neutral territory. This reading reflects modest upside momentum without signs of overbought conditions, implying room for further gains if buying pressure strengthens, though not yet enough conviction to signal a strong trend continuation.

Dubai court jails woman for crypto wallet theft According to reports, the incident occurred after the victim was introduced to a man who claimed to own an investment company and expressed interest in financing a business project. After protracted investment discussions, the man asked the investor to show proof of financial capability before finalizing agreements. This meant that the man asked the investor to demonstrate if he had the needed funds to complete the business project, noting that the investor had to show a substantial amount in crypto. A verification meeting was agreed to by both parties, and it was arranged in Dubai to complete the process. The man failed to attend the meeting, noting that something urgent came up at the last minute. However, he assured the investor that his wife would attend the meeting and oversee everything he needed to on his behalf. According to investigators, the woman attended the meeting in Dubai, and while handling the verification procedure, swapped the genuine wallet and replaced it with a similar-looking device. The investor discovered later that his digital assets had been transferred to another party and reported it to the police. The authorities kick-started their criminal investigation and referred the case to the Dubai Misdemeanours and Infractions Court after its finalization. The court convicted the woman of theft and sentenced her to two months in prison. In addition, she was also asked to pay a fine worth the value of the stolen assets at the time of the offense. Finally, the court also ordered her deportation from the UAE. The court orders $1 million in compensation to the victim The woman took the case to the Dubai Court of Appeals, which upheld the initial criminal ruling. Following the criminal judgment, the investor filed a civil lawsuit seeking compensation for financial losses and profits lost to the theft. He argued that the value of the stolen digital asset had increased after the woman stole his assets. The civil court ruled in his favor and ordered the defendant to pay Dh. 4.3 million ($1,170,768) in compensation. In addition, she was ordered to pay 5% annual legal interest until a full repayment is made. The court mentioned that digital assets are recognized as financial properties under the law and are protected. The woman’s husband, who was identified as a key participant in the scheme, has since absconded and remains at large. The case highlights growing legal recognition of digital assets in the UAE, as well as the serious consequences of fraud involving digital assets . Meanwhile, analysts have called on crypto holders to store their digital assets using the best techniques. The call came after Chainalysis released a report mentioning that the UAE was responsible for the highest crypto loss per person. The report mentioned that each victim of crypto theft in the UAE has lost approximately Dh. 293, 600 ($80,00). In addition, they also advised traders to strengthen their passwords, implement two-factor authentication, and be wary of phishing scams . The report mentioned that victims in the US came second, followed by victims in Chile, India, Lithuania, Japan, Israel, Norway, and Germany.

That new milestone was reached as some in the cryptocurrency community observed Genesis Day, the anniversary of Bitcoin’s first block. Reports note the timing drew attention because it highlighted contrasts between public borrowing and Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Debt Hits New High According to Treasury figures , the gross federal debt climbed past $38 trillion on January 3. The rise has been sharp over the last two years, moving from about $34 trillion in early 2024 to roughly $36 trillion by late 2024, and then at $38.5 trillion in late 2025. Analysts have calculated that the debt has been increasing by roughly $6 billion per day recently, a pace that pushes interest costs higher and narrows options for future budgets. Some of the increase comes from continuing budget shortfalls where spending outstrips revenue. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network launched with the mining of its first block, known as the Genesis Block. Embedded in that block was a headline from @TheTimes newspaper: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The message permanently anchors Bitcoin’s origin… pic.twitter.com/hGozJOYd3I — Bitcoin Policy UK (@bitcoinpolicyuk) January 3, 2026 Drivers Behind The Surge According to market coverage , several factors are behind the jump: sustained annual deficits, increasing interest payments on existing debt, and large spending bills enacted in recent sessions of Congress. Debt held by the public and amounts owed to federal trust funds together make up the headline figure. Economists warn that as the debt grows relative to the size of the economy, more taxpayer dollars will be needed just to service interest payments, which could crowd out other priorities. Bitcoin Community Responds On January 3, many Bitcoin supporters marked Genesis Day, a date they view as symbolic of financial change when Bitcoin’s first block was mined in 2009. Some users posted about the contrast between a national debt that keeps climbing and Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins. Others used the anniversary to elevate broader questions about fiscal rules and money supply. The reactions were mixed; some view it as a warning, others saw it as a moment for commemoration. Investors and commentators have weighed the implications. A portion of the market treats scarce assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against what they view as the risks of heavy borrowing. At the same time, mainstream economists caution that running large and persistent deficits can raise borrowing costs and slow growth over the long run. Treasury officials monitor cash needs closely and sometimes change borrowing schedules to cover gaps between receipts and outlays.

The move reflects a broader reassessment of where mining companies deploy capital as they balance volatile crypto prices with rising energy and infrastructure demands. By monetising assets in South America, Bitfarms is bringing forward cash flows that were previously expected years down the line. The proceeds are set to be redirected into new energy infrastructure tied to high-performance computing and artificial intelligence in North America, a segment the company sees as offering stronger long-term returns. Paraguay site sale The company has agreed to sell its Paso Pe facility in Paraguay to the Sympatheia Power Fund, managed by Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. The transaction values the site at up to $30 million and is subject to customary closing conditions. Bitfarms expects the deal to close within the next 60 days. Under the terms, Bitfarms will receive $9 million upfront. The remaining consideration of up to $21 million will be paid over the following 10 months, depending on the achievement of specific payment milestones. This structure allows the company to secure immediate liquidity while retaining exposure to near-term value from the asset. Capital redeployment Rather than reinvesting in additional mining capacity in Latin America, Bitfarms plans to channel the proceeds into North American energy infrastructure linked to HPC and AI workloads. Management has indicated that this approach effectively accelerates two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations. Those funds are expected to be redeployed during 2026, aligning with the company’s broader push to diversify beyond traditional bitcoin mining. The strategy highlights a growing trend among listed miners to explore adjacent computing markets that can offer steadier revenue streams. By reallocating capital, Bitfarms aims to improve returns on invested capital while reducing exposure to regions it no longer views as central to its long-term plans. Latin America exit The Paso Pe transaction completes Bitfarms’ withdrawal from Paraguay following an earlier divestment in the country. Just under a year ago, the company sold its Yguazú site to Hive Digital Technologies. Together, the two sales signal a full exit from Latin American operations. For Bitfarms, the decision underscores a strategic narrowing of focus. The company is prioritising jurisdictions and assets that can support both crypto mining and next-generation computing, rather than maintaining a broad international footprint. Market reaction The announcement adds to a wave of strategic repositioning among listed bitcoin miners as they reassess capital allocation amid shifting energy economics and rising interest in alternative compute uses. By accelerating cash realisation from legacy mining assets, Bitfarms is seeking greater flexibility to fund infrastructure that supports both digital asset mining and broader compute demand, reducing reliance on a single revenue stream.

Latest on‑chain data from CryptoQuant shows renewed accumulation, sparking debate over whether this signals a bullish surge or market caution ahead. Whale accumulation can drive bullish momentum. By removing coins from circulation, large investors support prices during consolidation. Historically, such buying during dips has often preceded upward moves, fueling optimism for a broader market recovery. Bitcoin ATM Fraud Hits Record Levels as Adoption Surges in the U.S. Bitcoin ATMs are booming across the U.S., but so are the risks. From January to November 2025, the FBI’s IC3 logged over 12,000 complaints and $333.5 M in losses, surging past 2024 levels and highlighting growing vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem. In 2025, over 10,000 people fell victim to Bitcoin ATM fraud. Scammers exploit crypto’s speed and anonymity through fake tech support, bogus investments, and high-pressure schemes, tricking users into irreversible ATM transfers. As Bitcoin ATMs surged past 30,000 in the U.S.,over 80% of the global total by the end of 2024, fraud has risen in tandem. While these machines offer easy crypto access, their rapid expansion has opened new avenues for criminal activity. Law enforcement continues to track Bitcoin ATM fraud and urges prompt reporting of suspicious activity. IC3 data highlights the need for public awareness, stronger security, and education to reduce losses. While cryptocurrency adoption grows, rising fraud underscores that financial innovation often attracts sophisticated criminal schemes. As the U.S. leads globally in bitcoin ATM installations, users and regulators must balance accessibility with safety. Enhanced vigilance, smarter reporting tools, and informed education are essential to curb fraud in this rapidly evolving sector. Conclusion Bitcoin accumulation by whales can signal bullish potential. By absorbing available supply, they reduce coins in circulation, often supporting prices during consolidation. Historically, whale buying on dips has preceded upward moves, suggesting the market could be gearing for a broader recovery. On the other hand, the rapid spread of Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. has fueled a surge in fraud, underscoring the urgent need for user vigilance and education. While these machines make crypto accessible, transactions are irreversible, making caution essential. Strengthening awareness, reporting, and security measures is key to safeguarding consumers and ensuring the safe, sustainable growth of digital finance.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The market leader made a play for a new all-time high above $100,000 as early as January, but struggled to keep its six-figure valuation as the year wound down. The Bitcoin price has started the new year in a similar fashion to 2025, making its way above the $90,000 mark. However, the market uncertainty is at a record high, with no one knowing what to expect from the digital asset market in 2026. BTC Price Consolidating In Symmetrical Triangle — What Next? In a January 3 post on the social media platform X, market analyst Ali Martinez painted a bullish picture for the Bitcoin price. The crypto pundit postulated that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an upward 15% price move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level The rationale behind this optimistic prediction is the appearance of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin price chart. The symmetrical triangle is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a diagonal falling upper trendline (connecting the swing highs) and a diagonally rising lower trendline (along the swing lows). In this symmetrical triangle chart formation, the asset price (BTC, in this case) typically contracts and moves toward the apex. The Bitcoin price eventually breaches either the upper trendline for a breakout or crosses the lower boundary, forming a breakdown. Hence, the symmetrical triangle pattern could provide a continuation or reversal signal depending on the direction of the break. It is worth mentioning that symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation break patterns, meaning the price tends to break in the initial trend direction before entering into the triangle pattern. If this theory holds in the current scenario, the Bitcoin price is likely to continue its upward movement after breaking the upper trendline here. The critical resistance in the upper trendline lies around the $91,000 region, and the flagship cryptocurrency needs a sustained close of at least two candlesticks above this level to confirm a bullish breakout. The price target is determined by adding the length of the widest point of the triangle (or base) to the breakout point. Based on this calculation, Martinez put forward a target above $102,000 for the Bitcoin price, representing a 15% surge from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $91,560, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

In the past three days, the premier cryptocurrency has gained by 3.4% to trade at $90,500. Bitcoin now lies at a decision point as multiple implications hinge on the next price move. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Whale Comeback Story May Be Overblown, Onchain Data Shows $123,500 Rebound Or $86,000 Pullback: What Next For Bitcoin? In an X post on January 3, pseudonymous analyst Bitcoin Meraklisi shares a two-pronged price analysis of the Bitcoin market. Following its recent rally, the expert explains that Bitcoin sits on top of a three-month downtrend, putting the asset at a decision point. In the bullish scenario of a decisive and convincing breakout past $90,500, Bitcoin is expected to immediately reach $94,800. If this target is met, there would be a strong potential to trade as high as $107,300, moving Bitcoin into the six-figure zones for the first time since mid-November. With an overwhelming bullish conviction, Meraklisi states that the premier cryptocurrency could also rebound to $123,500, representing a potential 36.5% on present market prices. On the other hand, if Bitcoin experiences another rejection, the analyst explains investors should expect an initial price drop to $88,000. However, a continued pullback to around $86,000 also remains on the card. Interestingly, Bitcoin Meraklisi notes that price prediction is presently difficult, considering the market’s heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic and external events. Over the past year, Bitcoin continued to experience growing adoption, reflected in rising institutional and government participation. However, the premier cryptocurrency has also suffered price declines due to geopolitical tensions and renewed trade-war concerns Related Reading: Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon Bitcoin RSI Flashes Positive Signal Amid the present market uncertainty, Meraklisi also notes that the Bitcoin relative strength index is showing a positive market signal after breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern to end a 3-month downtrend. If treated as a leading signal, this RSI breakout suggests that Bitcoin may overcome its current resistance level and potentially transition into a bullish price trajectory. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at $90,603, reflecting market gains of 0.76% and 3.13% in the last one and seven days, respectively. However, the monthly chart reports a minor loss of 1.68%, suggesting the market recovery is yet to commence. Bitcoin boasts a total market cap of $1.8 trillion and is ranked the largest cryptocurrency and eight largest asset in the world.

At the same time, capital is quietly rotating into utility-driven digital assets that can operate alongside traditional finance. Bitcoin has begun the year reclaiming momentum above $89,000, but it’s not the only one. Against this backdrop, Remittix , a new PayFi solution on Ethereum, is also starting to enjoy increased attention and adoption. Bitcoin Shows Early Signs of a Macro Trend Shift Towards the end of 2025, Bitcoin price predictions were very bearish because of the high number of token sell-offs. However, since the start of this year, the BTC price has been performing well again. Currently, Bitcoin is trading very close to $90,000 again, with a demonstrable marked refusal to break below the $88,000 mark. Because of this, traders are now speculating whether Bitcoin has enough momentum to ride this wave all the way back above $100,000. Even institutional behavior appears to support this narrative. Tether’s decision to add nearly $800 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing total holdings above 96,000 BTC. By allocating up to 15% of quarterly profits to Bitcoin acquisitions, Tether has reinforced the idea that Bitcoin remains central to crypto’s financial infrastructure, especially during uncertain macro conditions. Analysts and price prediction models expect it to happen. But in the meantime, Bitcoin investors are also diversifying exposure into lower-priced tokens with similar upside potential like Remittix. Remittix Emerges as the Leading Utility Counterpart to Bitcoin As discussions about Bitcoin’s performance abound and market speculations about its future continue, Remittix , a PayFi altcoin on Ethereum, is also enjoying lots of attention. Remittix has already secured over $28.6 million in private funding from investors and secured token listings on top exchanges like BitMart and LBANK, signalling strong adoption. According to analysts, the adoption strength Remittix is enjoying comes down to its incredible utility. Remittix is currently positioned at the intersection of cryptocurrency, payments, and global remittance with a focus on solving the $19 trillion problem of global payments. The Remittix wallet is already live on the app store, marking its first major product release. More importantly, the team has announced the launch of its crypto-to-fiat platform on February 9, 2026 , a milestone that could materially expand real-world usage. Here are some other things investors love about Remittix: Remittix is fully audited and verified by CertiK , boosting investor trust Impressive global adoption potential with Remittix already delivering live crypto-to-fiat support for individuals, merchants, and institutions in 30 different countries New limited-time 200% bonus on new deposits Clear payment-focused utility rather than speculative narratives The 2026 macro cycle appears increasingly favourable for assets that serve distinct but reinforcing roles.

The collapse erased household savings and pushed the prices of essential goods higher. According to reports, inflation rose to 42.2% year over year in December, while food prices and health-related costs climbed to 72% and 50%, respectively. The reports have worsened public frustration amid fears of hyperinflation. Demonstrations have expanded across several areas in Tehran and some major cities. Shopkeepers near the Grand Bazaar closed their stores and gathered in protest, adding their voices to the frustration of the masses. Stablecoin usage on the rise in Iran as rial plunges According to videos scattered online, there are several groups chanting against the ruling class, though authorities dispute the timelines around the footage. President Masoud Pezeshkian has also acknowledged the unrest, urging officials to move swiftly to tackle the issues that he describes as legitimate economic concerns. He has instructed the interior minister to engage directly with the leader of the protest. Parliament Speaker Mohammed Bagher Qalibaf has also called for urgent measures to protect the Iranian rial. He made the call while accusing foreign adversaries of taking advantage of the unrest. Despite these statements, footage has shown security forces deploying tear gas in some areas. Meanwhile, Iranians are now swiftly turning to cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as the rial continues to lose value. Most of them confirmed to have made the move to protect their purchasing power. Blockchain analysts have long tracked this trend in sanctioned economies, where access to traditional banking remains limited. Iranians are particularly gravitating towards stablecoins pegged to the United States dollar, as they see it as a practical hedge against local currency declines, especially during periods of instability and rapid devaluation cycles. The shift is also in line with Iran’s engagement with digital assets. According to earlier reports, Iran’s Ministry of Defense Export Center has signaled its intention to accept digital assets for payments for sales of arms overseas. Chainalysis also previously reported that sanctioned countries received more than $16 billion in digital assets in a single year, showing how digital assets and their underlying technology have been supporting cross-border transactions under pressure. Geopolitical tensions and economic turmoil The economic crisis has also caused a swift fallout as Central Bank Governor Mohammed Reza Farzin resigned on Monday, according to state media. Meanwhile, the renewed United Nations sanctions in 2025, which are tied to Iran’s nuclear program, have further restricted its access to three global markets, intensifying capital flight. Authorities have also announced temporary shutdowns across Tehran and other provinces, citing energy shortages and cold weather. Meanwhile, residents claim that despite the government shutdown, there has been a history of crypto firms tied to the administration carrying out energy-intensive mining operations . Geopolitical risks have resurfaced as the United States has warned Iran against any attempt to rebuild nuclear or missile capabilities. United States President Donald Trump has said that the United States would act again if Iran moved ahead to restore its nuclear program, though he noted that there could be a negotiated deal.

Others believe the following 12 months will be generous only for the bears, envisioning a severe pullback. The Bullish Scenario The largest cryptocurrency had its shining moments in 2025, and its price reached a new record of over $126,000 at the beginning of October. However, the following months were brutal, and BTC closed the year at around $87,000, marking an annual loss. In fact, this was the first time the asset ended a post-halving year in the red. Numerous analysts seem unconcerned about this, though, predicting that 2026 will be much more successful. X user KAY noted the latest resurgence to over $90,000, claiming that BTC’s “Adam and Eve” pattern is in play. The chat resembles a short dump followed by a rounding bottom formation. According to the market observer, BTC now needs a strong breakout above $94,000, after which “the bulls will be back in control.” JAVON MARKS and Crypto GEMS were even more optimistic. The former sees the asset rising to a new all-time high of $126,200, whereas the latter expects it to top around $210,000 sometime this year. Earlier this week, Ali Martinez revealed that approximately 20,000 BTC had left exchanges in the past week alone. The USD equivalent of the stash is almost $1.8 billion, and it supports the bullish thesis. Shifting from centralized exchanges to self-custody methods reduces selling pressure, while increased exchange balances could be interpreted as a pre-sale step. Major Dump Incoming? Some analysts stand in the opposite corner, forecasting that 2026 could be a devastating year for BTC. X user CryptoBullet said the asset’s 2025 looks “very bad,” rejecting the possibility that it could reach a fresh peak in 2026. “If you think that wasn’t the Cycle Top and in 2026 BTC will somehow go to a new ATH, you’re an idiot,” they added. According to many experts, Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle may no longer be valid. However, if the pattern remains intact, some analysts warn that a sharp price collapse could occur as early as this month. X user Chiefy, for instance, commented : “If the 4-year cycle is still in play, BTC will dump to $32,000 in January. Do you think you’re prepared for this scenario?” For their part, Crypto Caeser forecasted that BTC may trade in the wide range between $80,687 and $98,880 “for a while.” The post Top Bitcoin (BTC) Price Predictions for 2026 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The strikes took place at around 6 a.m. UTC and lasted for about 30 minutes, reports show. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Whale Comeback Story May Be Overblown, Onchain Data Shows Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, wrote on X that he does not expect “a widespread correction” tied to the attack, arguing the event was planned and has already passed market participants. Other analysts shared a similar view, saying dramatic moves usually come when traders expect worse things ahead. Bitcoin: Market Moves And Liquidations Based on reports, Bitcoin held firm above the $90,000 mark. CoinGecko data showed a rise of 1.50%, putting the token at $91,320 at the time of publication. I don’t think we’ll see a widespread correction based on the attack in Venezuela on #Bitcoin. It’s a planned and coordinated attack on Maduro, and is already past us. The likelihood of more negativity on the markets from that single event are relatively slim. I would assume… — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 3, 2026 CoinGlass figures indicate about $60 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated over the prior 24 hours, with roughly $55 million of that coming from short bets. That kind of forced selling can amp up volatility for a short period. Still, the broader pattern this time looked muted. Historical Drops Have Happened Fast There have been episodes when conflict pushed prices down quickly. In June 2025, for example, Bitcoin fell nearly 3%, sliding from $106,000 to $103,000 inside roughly 90 minutes after explosions in Tehran. Traders point out that sudden moves often follow when markets fear ongoing escalation. Here, many market watchers see less chance of follow-up actions that would deepen panic. Federal Debt And Genesis Day In The Middle Of Market Noise Based on reports, the US national debt passed $38 trillion on Saturday, with the US National Debt Clock placing it near $38.5 at the time. That milestone came as Bitcoin fans marked “Genesis Day,” the anniversary of the first block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. Happy Bitcoin Genesis Block day — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) January 3, 2026 Paolo Ardoino, CEO of stablecoin issuer Tether, posted a celebratory message, while Sam Callahan, director of strategy and research at BTC treasury firm OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment. For many in the community, the headline embedded in the Genesis Block remains a symbol of a monetary system capped in supply and not subject to the same printing pressures as fiat. Yeah generally the market really nukes when we expect things to get worse afterwards which doesn’t seem to be the case. Could see this actually bring some green to the market as people take this as a sign of strength tho — Tyler Hill (@Tylerhill) January 3, 2026 Community Reaction And Context Reports have shown some in the crypto space treated events like the strike and the rising US debt as separate but related stories. A few traders said the strike could bring “green” to markets as investors interpret decisive action as a sign of control, an outlook voiced by analyst Tyler Hill.

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00024675 to $0.00024770. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market inched higher over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the crucial $90,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) and other tokens registered marginal gains as the crypto market cap rose almost 1% at $3.11 trillion. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Ready For Move To $0.00024470 Husky Inu (HINU) is set for its next price increase during the pre-launch phase, which will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00024675 to $0.00024770. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Can Husky Inu AI Raise $1M? Husky Inu AI faced a dramatic slowdown in fundraising towards the end of 2025 as the markets faced a notable slowdown after the October flash crash. As a result, fundraising crawled to a halt as the project struggled to raise funds. The project has raised $917,618 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. Cryptocurrency Market Remains Positive Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market continued in positive territory over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other altcoins registered notable gains. BTC finally reclaimed the $90,000 mark as it rallied from Saturday’s low of $89,407 to cross $90,000 and reach an intraday high of $91,352. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading around $91,236, up 1.12%. ETH continued consolidating above $3,000, rising from a low of $3,081 to an intraday high of $3,159. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency is trading around $3,147, up almost 1%. Ripple (XRP) has reclaimed $2 and is trading around $2.04, up almost 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up 1.29% at $134. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 4% and Cardano (ADA) is up 0.68% at $0.397. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) have also registered notable increases over the past 24 hours. However, Polkadot (DOT) bucked the bullish trend and is down nearly 1% at $2.13.

While the price has shown signs of recovery, momentum remains muted, keeping the market in a fragile equilibrium. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has registered a bullish breakout above the descending channel that previously defined the corrective structure. This breakout is technically constructive, as it signals a shift away from persistent lower highs and sustained sell-side control. However, the quality of this breakout remains questionable due to the lack of strong bullish momentum and follow-through. The price has moved higher, but candles remain relatively shallow and overlapping, suggesting that buyers are not yet acting with conviction. Bitcoin is now approaching the main resistance zone around the $94K–$96K region, which aligns with a prior high-volume supply area. This level is critical, as it represents the first major test of the bullish breakout. A failure to reclaim and hold above this resistance would increase the risk of a false breakout, potentially pulling the price back into the prior range. For the daily structure to shift decisively bullish, BTC needs sustained acceptance above resistance, supported by volatility expansion and directional momentum. Until then, the breakout should be treated cautiously rather than as confirmation of a new impulsive cycle. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights the current indecision more clearly. The asset is consolidating within a tightening wedge structure, reflecting compression after the initial rebound. Higher lows are forming gradually, but upside progress remains capped by local resistance, keeping the price locked in a narrow range. This type of structure typically precedes expansion, but direction remains unresolved. The ongoing consolidation suggests that both buyers and sellers are positioning ahead of a decisive move. Without a clean breakout above the wedge resistance, the recent advance remains corrective within the broader context. A sustained break higher, followed by acceptance above local resistance of $95K, would be required to support the case for another bullish cycle. Conversely, failure to resolve higher could result in renewed downside pressure and a return toward the lower demand zones at the $80K range. Until resolution occurs, range-bound and liquidity-driven price action remains the dominant theme. Sentiment Analysis The liquidation heatmap provides valuable context for near-term price behaviour. A clear concentration of liquidation levels has built up below the current price, particularly around the $85K–$87K region, indicating a dense cluster of leveraged long exposure. This liquidity acts as a downside magnet in the event of weakness, as a sharp move lower could trigger cascading liquidations. At the same time, overhead liquidity appears more fragmented, suggesting that upside continuation may require additional buildup before a sustained squeeze can occur. The recent grind higher has already cleared short-term liquidation pockets above with little momentum, reinforcing the idea that current price action lacks strong directional urgency. As long as Bitcoin remains within this liquidity balance, short-term moves are likely to be driven by stop-hunts rather than trend expansion. A decisive breakaway from these liquidation clusters will be necessary to confirm the next meaningful directional move.

Only two virtual asset service providers (VASPs) were approved in 2025, down from four in 2024. South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit has also increased approval times from 11 months to 16 months. South Korea’s FIU is delaying approval for VASPs South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) approved only two new virtual asset service providers (VASPs) for the entire year of 2025. Happy Block received approval in January for exchange and trading operations, while Blosafe was approved in August for transfer and storage management services. The average period from application submission to approval increased from 11 months in 2024 to 16 months in 2025. Blosafe’s application took over 600 days to get approved. Industry sources indicate that numerous virtual assets are unable to launch their operations due to these extended delays . Bit Korea, a joint venture with Hana Bank established in 2024, submitted its application to South Korea’s FIU, but so far, the company has not received approval and cannot conduct business. Under South Korea’s regulatory structure, companies can register as virtual asset operators but cannot operate without receiving approval. On December 23, a year and four months past the deadline, the FIU approved the license renewal for Dunamu, which operates Upbit , South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The FIU imposed a 35.2 billion won fine on Dunamu in November 2025 for violations, including negligence in anti-money laundering obligations. Korbit submitted its renewal application in September 2025, while Bithumb, Coinone, and Gopax filed in October. On December 31, Korbit received notification of an institutional warning and a 2.73 billion won fine for regulatory violations. Are suspicious crypto transactions surging in South Korea? Between January and August 2025, virtual asset service providers filed 36,684 suspicious transaction reports with the Financial Intelligence Unit, already exceeding the combined totals of 16,076 reports in 2023 and 19,658 reports in 2024. The Korea Customs Service reported that from 2021 through August 2025, about 9.56 trillion won was involved in cryptocurrency-linked crimes. Approximately 90% of these cases involved hwanchigi schemes, which are illegal foreign remittance operations where criminal proceeds are converted into cryptocurrency through overseas exchanges, routed into domestic platforms, and cashed out in Korean won. As Cryptopolitan reported , South Korea announced plans in November 2025 to expand its Travel Rule requirements to cover all transaction sizes, eliminating previous exemptions for transfers under 1 million won. Hana Financial Group Chairman Ham Young-joo sai d th at stablecoins should be considered a strategic priority in his January 3 New Year’s message and stressed the need to build comprehensive systems for stablecoin issuance and distribution.

The flagship cryptocurrency briefly lost its hold above the $90,000 mark after US President Donald Trump announced the capture of the Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro. While the long-term impact of the latest US military strikes on the cryptocurrency market remains unknown, the Bitcoin price seems to be gearing up for an upward move in the short term. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the cryptocurrency market leader could potentially reach a correction low. Could A Bottom Be Forming For BTC Price? Crypto analyst Darkfost revealed in a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform that the most reactive group of Bitcoin investors, known as short-term holders (STHs), have remained under pressure, as the BTC price oscillates between the $85,000 and $92,000 levels. Darkfost shared that the Bitcoin short-term holders have their estimated cost basis around $103,000, after accounting for the on-chain impact of Coinbase’s recent large BTC transfers . Based on data from CryptoQuant, the average unrealized losses for this investor cohort stand at around 15%. As Darkfost explained in their Quicktake post, this figure was arrived at based on the percentage deviation from the short-term holder cost basis. “Using this approach makes it possible to identify periods when the most reactive and sensitive investors in the market are under stress,” the on-chain analyst said. From a historical perspective, when Bitcoin short-term holders witness significant drawdowns, and their average unrealized losses stand at around 15%, the formation of a correction low is often next for the premier cryptocurrency. According to Darkfost, BTC could be staring at a similar situation here. However, the crypto analyst noted that this signal could be false, especially if the Bitcoin price is at the start of an extended bear market. A deep or prolonged bear market could cause the STH’s unrealized losses to stay above 15% for longer periods or open the door to persistent distribution. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $91,160, reflecting a more than 1% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency has increased by nearly 4% in the past seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Reports show a sharp fall in money stolen by wallet-draining scams, even as attackers tested new tricks tied to recent protocol changes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Scam Sniffer Data Shows Drop According to Scam Sniffer’s 2025 analysis, wallet drainer phishing losses fell to about $83.85 million — an 83% decline from roughly $494 million in 2024. The number of affected wallets dropped to around 106,000, a fall of about 68% year-on-year. These figures come from the security platform’s annual study and were picked up by major crypto outlets. Attackers Shift, Not Stop Only 11 incidents topped $1 million in 2025, down from 30 the prior year, signaling fewer headline grabs but a rise in smaller hits. The largest single theft recorded last year was roughly $6.5 million, tied to a malicious Permit signature attack. Average losses per victim fell to roughly $790, which suggests attackers moved toward more frequent, lower-value strikes. Market Moves Mattered Losses followed market activity. The third quarter logged the highest damage at about $31 million, when Ethereum’s rally brought more users and approvals onchain. Monthly peaks included August, which posted about $12.17 million, while December was the quietest with roughly $2 million. That pattern shows fraudsters target busy trading windows. 1/ Ever woken up to an empty crypto wallet? With scammers draining $107K+ across EVM chains JUST THIS WEEK (per @zachxbt), it’s scarier than ever! Shoutout to @realscamsniffer for their 2025 report – losses down 83%, but threats are evolving FAST. Let’s recap & warn on 2026… https://t.co/uSerpsg80d — JP (@rugpullfinder) January 3, 2026 Permit Signatures And New Vectors Reports highlighted Permit and Permit2 signature abuses as a major driver of big losses, accounting for a large share of multi-million cases. Scam Sniffer also flagged EIP-7702 batch signature techniques that were used in a few complex attacks after network upgrades. Security teams say these methods exploit user approval flows rather than raw smart-contract bugs. Why The Drop Happened Analysts attribute much of the improvement to better wallet warnings, wider use of approval revocation tools, and more active tracking by onchain monitors. Some defenders also point to reduced market froth in parts of the year, which lowered the pool of high-value targets. Still, multiple outlets stress that reduced totals do not equal safety. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Based on reports, phishing will likely remain cyclical: losses could spike again during big rallies or when new signing features are introduced. Security firms urge users to check approvals, avoid blind signing, and use wallet tools that flag risky requests. Regulators and exchanges are watching the trend, but responsibility for many attacks still falls to individual users and wallet software.

When price compresses after a breakout, experienced traders watch closely, knowing that continuation patterns tend to precede the strongest moves. XRP now trades within such a phase, where technical alignment carries more weight than short-term sentiment or headlines. In a recent post on X, FeFe analyzed XRP’s evolving setup through its four-hour chart, focusing on structure rather than speculation. The analyst argued that XRP’s current behavior reflects a recurring breakout pattern that has historically preceded major upside expansions. This supports FeFe’s November 2025 prediction that XRP could move from $2 to $20. XRP Holds Above a Key Breakout Level As of report time, XRP trades near $2.09 and continues to defend a former resistance zone that has flipped into support. On the 4-hour chart, price broke out cleanly and is now consolidating steadily. XRP maintains a sequence of higher lows while respecting dynamic support levels, a structure that typically signals trend continuation rather than exhaustion. Current TA structure for XRP supports $20 hypothesis https://t.co/NwI6hyIzWN pic.twitter.com/1fx41GTRYf — FeFe (@fefe01101100) January 4, 2026 This behavior suggests that buyers continue to absorb selling pressure without allowing meaningful breakdowns. Such stability often appears when the market prepares for expansion rather than reversal. Fractal Structure Reflects Previous XRP Rallies FeFe’s analysis places strong emphasis on fractal behavior. XRP’s current four-hour pattern closely resembles structures that preceded historical surges, where price paused briefly after reclaiming major levels before accelerating sharply. While fractals never repeat perfectly, markets frequently echo similar psychological and liquidity-driven behaviors across cycles. In past instances, XRP resolved comparable consolidation phases with rapid upside once momentum returned. The present structure continues to align with those historical precedents. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Basis for the $20 Hypothesis The $20 target emerges from the alignment of short-term structure with higher-timeframe technical projections. FeFe connects the four-hour breakout to broader Fibonacci extensions and prior cycle range expansions that converge near the $20 region. His November 2025 thesis framed the move as a structural expansion rather than a speculative spike, contingent on XRP holding its reclaimed support zones. So far, price action continues to validate that framework. XRP has not displayed signs of distribution or trend failure within the current structure. Structure Signals Probability, Not Certainty Despite the constructive setup, FeFe maintains a disciplined stance on risk. Market structure defines probability rather than guaranteed outcomes. Bitcoin dominance, liquidity, and macro trends will still impact whether this plays out. A sustained loss of current support would weaken the thesis and invalidate the pattern. For now, XRP’s technical structure offers one of its strongest confirmations in this cycle, with price behavior supporting the $20 hypothesis through structure-driven evidence rather than hype.

He had been sentenced in November 2024 for a money-laundering conspiracy tied to the theft of about 120,000 bitcoin, one of the largest crypto thefts on record. The move has reignited debate over how prison credits and reform laws affect high-value cybercrime cases. Bitcoin Hacker’s Release Credited To First Step Act According to Lichtenstein’s public posts and interviews, he credited his early freedom to the First Step Act, the prison-reform law signed by US President Donald Trump in 2018. Reports say he was placed on home confinement after qualifying for earned time credits and program participation, a process allowed under federal rules. He posted on social media a short message thanking Trump and saying he hopes to work in cybersecurity going forward. Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can. To the supporters, thank you for everything.To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong. — Ilya Lichtenstein (@cipherstein) January 2, 2026 The Theft And The Sentence Based on reports from federal prosecutors, the Bitfinex breach involved nearly 120,000 bitcoin , which at the time was worth roughly $71 million and later ballooned in value as markets rose. Lichtenstein pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in US District Court on November 14, 2024. The Department of Justice described the laundering operation as complex and said prosecutors recovered the bulk of the stolen funds. Details Of The Case Reports have disclosed that Lichtenstein and his then-partner Heather Morgan used layered transfers, fake identities, and conversions across services to obscure the source of funds. The couple were arrested in 2022 after agents traced a set of private keys and other evidence back to their accounts. Morgan, known online as Razzlekhan, pleaded guilty as well and received a shorter sentence; she was also reported to have been released early. The case drew wide attention because agents later seized a large portion of the assets tied to the hack. Bitcoin Recovery, Seizures And Public Reaction Federal filings and news agencies say investigators recovered more than 90% of the stolen Bitcoin and the government seized billions in crypto-linked assets, a recovery that prosecutors called one of the largest in US history. The sale and custody of those assets remain part of ongoing administrative steps. Many legal experts and members of the public have pushed back on the timing and optics of the early release, arguing that cases involving billions in stolen property raise unusual questions about deterrence and fairness.

Whereas, the total crypto market cap has reached $3.12 trillion along with daily trading volume near $75 billion, reflecting rising institutional activity. The Fear and Greed Index stands at 40 (neutral), a sharp improvement from December’s fear levels, while the Altcoin Season Index at 25 confirms the market remains in a clear Bitcoin-dominant phase. Analysts say ETF demand is tightening supply at a time when liquidity remains thin, creating ideal conditions for higher prices. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Triangle Breakout Points to $94K From a technical perspective, Bitcoin price prediction seems to have turned bullish as it has confirmed a breakout from a triangle after a month-long consolidation. The breakout above $89,500 marks a decisive end to December’s sideways action and hints at the start of a new bullish leg. The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin trading around $91,260, forming a pattern of higher lows and steadily rising volume. A 50-EMA crossover above the 100-EMA confirms strengthening momentum, while the RSI near 69 suggests controlled bullish pressure without entering overbought territory. Candlestick signals reinforce the bullish view, a bullish engulfing candle broke resistance, followed by a spinning top at $92,000, signaling short-term consolidation before a potential continuation higher. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Market Outlook: Eyes on $94K and Beyond If Bitcoin manages to stay above $89,000, we’re looking at the next run-up spots between $93,500 and $94,600- the path seems promising for a possible push towards $98,000 in the coming weeks. But if it were to close below $88,400, though, we could see that whole thing come crashing down and invite some short-term selling. Things are looking optimistic right now, as more ETF money is flowing in and regular traders are jumping back in – of course, it doesn’t hurt that altcoins are still lagging, which suggests a more mature bull run rather than just wild speculation. If this momentum keeps going, Bitcoin could soon be eyeing $100K in Q1 of ’26 – driven by all that new ETF money, plus the fact that significant macro trends are starting to play in favor of digital assets. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-warns-xrp-holders-were-getting-extremely-rich-in-the-next-1-2-months-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Crypto market cycles rarely shift without warning, but they often disguise their most important signals in plain sight. As Bitcoin continues to dominate market liquidity, subtle structural changes are emerging beneath the surface. These shifts tend to appear before capital rotates, not after. For XRP holders, recent market data suggests that the conditions preceding major upside moves may be forming once again. In a recent post that has gained significant traction on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted a historically reliable macro indicator pointing toward a near-term altcoin expansion. Instead of focusing narrowly on XRP price action, the analyst examined Bitcoin dominance trends using Blockchain Center data, framing his outlook within broader market rotation dynamics. Steph argues that this macro setup, rather than hype or sentiment, underpins his bullish short-term outlook. WARNING TO ALL $XRP HOLDERS. WE’RE GETTING EXTREMELY RICH IN THE NEXT 1-2 MONTHS! pic.twitter.com/6sq1yrpSNX — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 3, 2026 Bitcoin Dominance Approaches a Key Historical Threshold Bitcoin dominance currently stands near 59%, a level that has repeatedly acted as a turning point in past bull cycles. When dominance reaches this zone, Bitcoin often begins to lose relative strength as capital searches for higher beta opportunities across the altcoin market. Historical charts from Blockchain Center show that previous stalls at similar dominance levels preceded sharp declines and rapid altcoin outperformance. Steph emphasizes that dominance does not need to collapse instantly to signal rotation. Instead, slowing momentum and structural hesitation often mark the early phase of capital redistribution, which typically benefits large-cap altcoins first. Altcoin Season Index Confirms Early-Stage Conditions Supporting this view, the Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 37, firmly within Bitcoin-dominant territory. This reading suggests most altcoins haven’t yet outperformed Bitcoin, a pattern that historically occurs before (not during) major altcoin rallies. Steph interprets this as confirmation that the market has not entered euphoria, leaving room for expansion rather than exhaustion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Blockchain Center’s long-term models associate this combination of elevated Bitcoin dominance and suppressed altcoin performance with the early stages of what it defines as a mini-altseason. Projections suggest this phase will likely start around mid-2026, matching Steph’s short-term expectations. Why XRP Could Benefit Disproportionately XRP often lags during Bitcoin-led phases but accelerates rapidly once capital rotation begins. Its deep liquidity, established infrastructure, and reduced regulatory uncertainty compared to previous cycles position it as a prime candidate during early altcoin inflows. Steph noted that similar structural setups in past cycles preceded sharp XRP moves once dominance began to fade. Probability, Not Certainty Steph makes it clear that dominance charts signal probability rather than guarantees. Broader liquidity conditions, macroeconomic developments, and institutional flows still influence outcomes. However, the alignment of historical dominance behavior, early rotation metrics, and current market structure forms the basis of his conviction. For XRP holders, the data suggests that the market may be closer to a transition than surface-level price action implies.

The top cryptocurrency is currently range-bound after a strong correction from its 2025 highs of more than $126,000. Bitcoin was at one point considered the only best investment option in the crypto market. However, currently, it has limited room to grow due to its massive market capitalization of over $1.76 trillion and its strong institutional inflow via exchange-traded funds. Its potential appears to be climaxing as experts project a further consolidation or even correction in case of weak economic conditions. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a nascent and very promising DeFi token trading for well under $0.05, provides a much higher possible rate of return on investment as a DeFi token. With funding of $19,600,000 and no less than 18,660 investors on board already, a relatively low stake of just $1,000 invested now in Phase 7 pricing levels might provide as much as a return of 35x in four months if the post-listing token performance follows projected levels, elevating the investment to a total of $35,000. Bitcoin Enters Stagnant Phase Bitcoin is currently trending between $87,000 and $89,000, registering small gains on a daily basis but no breakout yet. After registering the first annual loss since 2022 at the close of the year 2025, it’s safe to state that this particular asset has finally demonstrated maturity and no longer exemplifies explosive growth. High pricing makes it difficult for this particular asset to register dramatic price multiples. Whereas for those investors actively looking for the next big cryptocurrency or the best one to buy, Bitcoin is slowly being perceived less as a highly attractive growth play and more as a store of value, due to the absence of either this utility or the associated scarcity factor, characteristic of DeFi projects. Presale Activity Regains Momentum Mutuum Finance has launched Phase 7 of its presale and the price is set at $0.04, benefiting a 300% surge since Phase 1 when it was only $0.01. More than $19,600,000 has been successfully raised, and there are 18,660 holders who believe that this is one of the best crypto to invest in today. However, phase 7 is filling up very rapidly, which presents the last chance to acquire tokens at this pricing as phase 8 will start at $0.045. The price set for the upcoming launch is pegged at $0.06, which puts today’s investors right on target for immediate ROI even before MUTM officially starts trading. All the preceding presale phases offered quick sellouts due to the rising demand of the tokens. An increase in dual lending One key advantage of Mutuum Finance is its new dual-market lending platform, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled markets with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) direct contracts. On the P2C markets, participants lock away their assets in the form of ETH or USDT in order to generate passive income based on the pool of loans being issued in the market. Suppliers receive mtTokens, which earn interest automatically. For instance, investing $5,000 in ETH might produce a potential annual interest rate of 8%, meaning that a passive profit of $400 can be accrued without even liquidating the invested asset. The second model enables users to invest in more volatile assets, where mutually beneficial terms that are not commonly witnessed on other platforms are feasible on a P2P basis. Therefore, MUTM is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy, considering its use case that surpasses mere speculation. Stablecoin Increases Long-Term Value Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance has plans to introduce an on-demand stablecoin fully pegged at a one-to-one ratio with the dollar, which will further enhance its entire ecosystem for all participants. This will ensure that the volatility risk exposure is further reduced while also enhancing the liquidity pools and institutional-grade borrowers on the platform. Portion of the fees generated in the platform will be subject to buybacks before being distributed to stakers. Analysts believe the various MUTM fundamentals such as its lending and borrowing models, native stablecoin, and buyback & distribute mechanisms will push prices towards $0.10 and above in the first year of its existence, yielding a profit of 200% or more from the current prices. Grasping Emerging Opportunities For those hoping to find the best cryptocurrency to invest, or the best investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies in the near future, Mutuum Finance sets itself apart. As the price of Bitcoin holds firm at unusually high levels without significant appreciation, MUTM has the rarity, the usability, and the potential for appreciation that truly characterizes the leading cryptocurrencies.

This event, occurring as global markets resumed activity on Monday, underscores the persistent and critical disconnect between regulated financial derivatives and the ceaseless cryptocurrency spot markets. Consequently, this gap immediately captured the attention of institutional and retail traders alike, who monitor such discrepancies for potential trading signals and market equilibrium clues. Decoding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The $1,065 opening discrepancy is not a random price fluctuation. Instead, it is a direct structural artifact of the trading calendars governing different market venues. Specifically, the CME’s Bitcoin futures market operates on a traditional schedule, closing on weekends and holidays. Conversely, the underlying Bitcoin spot market trades continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Therefore, when the futures market reopens, its price must instantly adjust to reflect all price discovery that occurred in the spot market during its closure. This adjustment manifests as a gap on the price chart. Market technicians and seasoned futures traders pay close attention to these gaps. Historically, there is a observed tendency for prices to “fill” or revert to the level of the gap at a later point. This expectation stems from the theory of market efficiency, which suggests that such arbitrage opportunities between closely linked markets are temporary. However, the fill is not guaranteed and depends heavily on subsequent market sentiment and liquidity flows. Price Discovery: The gap represents deferred price discovery from the weekend’s spot trading. Arbitrage Signal: It creates a potential arbitrage opportunity between futures and spot prices. Sentiment Indicator: A gap up, as seen here, generally reflects bullish sentiment that built over the weekend. The Broader Context of Cryptocurrency Derivatives This specific event fits into the larger, evolving narrative of cryptocurrency financialization. The CME launched its Bitcoin futures in December 2017, providing the first regulated venue for institutional exposure. Since then, the market has matured dramatically. For instance, open interest—the total number of outstanding contracts—regularly exceeds billions of dollars, signaling deep institutional participation. Furthermore, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has created additional layers of interplay between spot prices, futures prices, and fund NAVs. The behavior of CME futures also influences other market metrics. Analysts often scrutinize the CME futures basis—the difference between the futures price and the spot price. A positive basis, or contango, suggests the market expects higher future prices. The weekend gap directly impacts this basis at the open, creating a momentary distortion that traders may seek to exploit. Additionally, the quarterly expiration and roll of these futures contracts are now major events on the crypto calendar, often accompanied by increased volatility. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Impact Financial analysts emphasize that these gaps are a feature, not a bug, of the current market infrastructure. They highlight the role of market makers and arbitrage desks, whose job is to profit from these very inefficiencies, thereby providing liquidity and helping to close the gap. Their activity is a primary mechanism that pulls futures prices toward spot prices, or vice versa. However, during periods of extreme volatility or low liquidity, gaps can widen and persist longer than usual. The long-term impact of these recurring events is a more integrated market. Each gap and subsequent fill contributes to price convergence and teaches market participants about the dynamics between continuous and discrete trading venues. Regulatory bodies monitor this activity closely, as the CME’s regulated nature provides a transparent price benchmark that influences the broader, less-regulated crypto ecosystem. Data from past gaps shows no consistent predictive power for long-term price direction, but they remain a crucial short-term tactical indicator for active traders. Conclusion The $1,065 CME Bitcoin futures gap serves as a powerful, real-time case study in market mechanics. It vividly illustrates the tension between traditional financial market hours and the perpetual motion of digital asset markets. Understanding this phenomenon is essential for any serious market participant, as it reveals the ongoing process of price discovery and integration between the nascent crypto economy and established financial systems. Ultimately, while individual gaps may capture headlines, their true significance lies in what they reveal about the deepening sophistication and interconnectedness of global cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What causes a gap in CME Bitcoin futures? A gap occurs because the CME futures market is closed on weekends while Bitcoin trades 24/7. The Monday open price must therefore jump to reflect all weekend spot market activity, creating a visible gap on the chart. Q2: Do futures gaps always get filled? While there is a strong historical tendency for prices to retrace and “fill” the gap, it is not a certainty. Market sentiment, news flow, and macro conditions can override this technical pattern. Q3: How do institutional traders use these gaps? Institutions and arbitrage desks often use gaps to execute strategies that bet on price convergence. They may short futures if the gap up is deemed excessive or go long if a gap down presents a buying opportunity relative to spot. Q4: What is the difference between a CME futures gap and regular Bitcoin volatility? A gap is a specific structural discontinuity caused by market hours. General volatility occurs during continuous trading due to news, order flow, and sentiment. Gaps are predictable in timing (market open) but unpredictable in size and direction. Q5: Does the CME futures price influence the spot Bitcoin price? Yes, they influence each other. The CME price is a major regulated benchmark. Significant moves there can affect sentiment and algorithmic trading in the spot market, and vice-versa, especially around gap openings and contract expirations.

This milestone represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, continuing a multi-week bullish trend that has captured global financial attention. Consequently, analysts are now examining the confluence of factors driving this ascent and its potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $92,000 Milestone The move past $92,000 marks a critical technical and psychological threshold for Bitcoin. Historically, round-number levels often act as both resistance and support zones. This specific price point follows a consolidation period where BTC tested the $88,000 to $90,000 range multiple times. Market data reveals a steady increase in trading volume on major exchanges, particularly Binance, which often leads price discovery. Furthermore, the Binance USDT pair, being one of the most liquid trading pairs globally, provides a reliable benchmark for the asset’s global valuation. Several key metrics underscore the strength of this move. The 24-hour trading volume for Bitcoin has increased by approximately 35% compared to the weekly average. Additionally, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has risen, indicating sustained institutional and retail participation. Importantly, the rally has occurred with relatively low volatility for such a significant price jump, suggesting a foundation of strong buyer conviction rather than speculative frenzy. Technical and On-Chain Context On-chain analytics firms report a decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges, signaling a trend toward accumulation and long-term holding. The number of addresses holding 1 BTC or more has reached a new all-time high. Simultaneously, the hash rate, a measure of network security and miner commitment, remains near its peak, providing fundamental support for the asset’s value proposition. Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Multiple macroeconomic and sector-specific catalysts are converging to fuel Bitcoin’s current price trajectory. Primarily, shifting monetary policy expectations from major central banks have renewed interest in hard assets. As traditional fiat currencies face inflationary pressures, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a digital store of value. Moreover, recent regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions has reduced uncertainty, allowing institutional capital to flow into the market with greater confidence. The adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset by publicly listed companies continues to provide a structural bid for the asset. Several new corporate announcements in Q1 2025 have added to this trend. Concurrently, developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem itself, including advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, are improving its utility and long-term viability as a payment network. Macroeconomic Factors: Easing inflation data, potential interest rate pauses. Institutional Adoption: New ETF inflows, corporate treasury allocations. Regulatory Landscape: Clearer frameworks in the EU, UK, and parts of Asia. Network Development: Increased activity in layer-2 protocols and smart contract platforms built on Bitcoin. Historical Context and Market Cycle Comparison Bitcoin’s journey to $92,000 must be viewed within its historical market cycles. The asset has experienced several major bull and bear markets since its inception. The current rally shares characteristics with past cycles, including rising public interest and increasing media coverage. However, it also exhibits distinct differences, notably the depth of institutional involvement and its integration into traditional finance. For instance, the approval and success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have created a new, regulated channel for investment that did not exist in previous cycles. The following table compares key metrics from the 2021 cycle peak to the current environment: Metric 2021 Cycle (Nov 2021) Current Environment (April 2025) Price (Approx.) $69,000 $92,000 Primary Driver Retail FOMO, Low Rates Institutional ETFs, Macro Hedge Exchange Balances High & Increasing Low & Decreasing Mayer Multiple (Price/200D MA) ~2.5 ~1.8 This comparison suggests the market structure may be healthier now, with supply increasingly moving to strong, long-term holders. Expert Perspectives on Sustainability Market analysts offer measured perspectives on the rally’s sustainability. “While the breach of $92,000 is technically significant, the underlying on-chain health is more telling,” notes a senior analyst from a major crypto research firm. “We are seeing accumulation from long-term holders, not just leveraged speculation. This suggests a more durable price foundation.” Other experts point to the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle, a pre-programmed event that reduces the rate of new supply, as a fundamental tailwind that has historically preceded major price appreciation periods. Potential Impacts and Future Trajectory The sustained price above $92,000 has immediate and longer-term implications. In the short term, it can trigger algorithmic trading strategies and options market activity centered around key price levels. For the broader cryptocurrency market, a strong Bitcoin often acts as a rising tide, lifting the valuations of alternative digital assets (altcoins) as investor confidence grows. However, it can also lead to capital rotation out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, a phenomenon known as ‘Bitcoin dominance.’ Looking ahead, the next significant resistance levels are widely viewed as the previous all-time high near $100,000 and the psychologically important $100,000 mark itself. Market participants will closely watch for a sustained weekly close above $92,000 to confirm the breakout’s validity. Conversely, key support levels to monitor are now situated around $88,000 and $85,000, which were former resistance zones. The overall health of global risk assets and any shifts in monetary policy will remain primary external factors influencing Bitcoin’s path forward. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $92,000 represents a major milestone, underscored by strong technicals, improving fundamentals, and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. This move is not an isolated event but part of a broader narrative of digital asset maturation and integration into the global financial system. The Bitcoin price action reflects a complex interplay of supply dynamics, institutional adoption, and macro hedging demand. As the market digests this level, the focus will shift to sustainability, network growth, and the evolving role of cryptocurrency in a digital-first economy. The journey to this BTC $92,000 valuation highlights the asset’s continued resilience and its growing significance on the world financial stage. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $92,000 on Binance USDT mean? It means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin can be bought or sold for approximately 92,000 Tether (USDT) tokens, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This is a key global pricing benchmark due to Binance’s high liquidity. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin’s price is rising? Primary drivers include increased institutional investment through ETFs, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, decreasing supply on exchanges, and positive developments in its underlying technology and regulatory environment. Q3: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The previous all-time high was approximately $73,000 in March 2024. The current price of $92,000 represents a new record high, surpassing the previous peak by a significant margin. Q4: Is now a good time to invest in Bitcoin? This is a financial decision that depends on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and research. Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider consulting a qualified financial advisor. Q5: What happens if Bitcoin’s price falls below $92,000 again? Price retracements are common in volatile markets. A drop below this level would likely see the market test nearby support zones, such as $88,000. It does not invalidate the long-term trend but would indicate a period of consolidation or correction.

56828468,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258335,1767573311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveals Hopeful Shift: Market Sentiment Climbs to 26, Escaping Extreme Fear",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-rises-26/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveals Hopeful Shift: Market Sentiment Climbs to 26, Escaping Extreme Fear Global cryptocurrency markets registered a subtle but significant psychological shift this week as the widely monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbed one point to 26, officially moving the market sentiment out of ‘Extreme Fear’ and into the ‘Fear’ category. This nuanced change, reported by data provider Alternative.me, offers a critical snapshot of investor psychology amid ongoing market consolidation and provides a data-driven lens for analyzing potential future trajectories. For traders and long-term holders alike, understanding the mechanics and implications of this sentiment gauge is essential for navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Rise to 26 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a daily barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Consequently, its movement from 25 to 26 represents more than a simple numerical change. Fundamentally, the index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ Therefore, a reading of 26 firmly places market sentiment in the ‘Fear’ zone, but at its higher threshold, suggesting a tentative reduction in pervasive pessimism. Historically, sustained periods in Extreme Fear have often preceded market rebounds, making exits from this zone noteworthy events for analysts. Alternative.me compiles this index using a multifaceted, weighted formula designed to quantify qualitative market emotions. The provider aggregates data from six primary sources to ensure a balanced and robust reading. For instance, market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score, capturing raw market activity and turbulence. Simultaneously, social media sentiment and surveys each account for 15%, directly measuring community and investor outlook. Finally, Bitcoin’s market dominance and relevant Google search trends each make up 10%, reflecting Bitcoin’s overarching influence and public interest levels. This methodological blend prevents the index from relying on any single metric. The Components Driving Market Sentiment Shifts To understand the index’s recent climb, one must examine the underlying components. Market volatility, a key 25% input, has shown signs of stabilization compared to the extreme swings witnessed in previous months. Although volatility remains elevated by traditional asset standards, its relative calming likely contributed positively to the score. Similarly, trading volume, the other major 25% component, has seen modest but consistent activity, indicating that market participants are still engaged rather than exiting entirely. On the social and survey front, analysis of major crypto discussion forums and news sentiment reveals a cautious uptick in neutral-to-hopeful discourse, moving away from overwhelmingly negative narratives. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market dominance has held relatively steady, maintaining its role as the market anchor. Google search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘crypto bear market’ has slightly declined, while searches for ‘crypto recovery’ and ‘buy Bitcoin’ have seen minor increases. This collective shift in data points coalesced into the one-point index gain. Historical Context and Expert Analysis of Sentiment Indicators Financial psychologists and behavioral economists have long studied sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index. Dr. Amelia Chen, a behavioral finance researcher, notes, ‘Sentiment indices are contrarian indicators at extremes. A move out of Extreme Fear doesn’t signal an all-clear, but it does suggest the peak of panic may be passing. Market bottoms are processes, not points, and sentiment improvement is a necessary first step.’ This perspective aligns with historical index data, which shows that prolonged stays in Extreme Fear (readings below 25) have frequently marked accumulation phases for strategic investors. The following table illustrates the index’s categorization and typical market characteristics associated with each zone: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear High selling pressure, negative news dominance, potential capitulation. 25-49 Fear Cautious trading, mixed sentiment, consolidation phases. 50-74 Greed Increasing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), rising prices, bullish news. 75-100 Extreme Greed Speculative frenzy, overvaluation concerns, potential market tops. Transitioning from Extreme Fear to Fear often involves a change in market narrative. Currently, this shift coincides with macroeconomic developments, including evolving central bank policies and institutional adoption milestones, which provide a real-world backdrop for the sentiment change. Analysts monitor whether this is a fleeting reaction or the start of a sustained sentiment recovery. Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For market participants, the index’s movement offers practical insights rather than direct buy or sell signals. Primarily, it aids in risk assessment and context setting. When the index resides in Extreme Fear, as it did prior to this update, the probability of panic selling diminishes because the most fearful investors have often already exited. Conversely, a rise toward Greed signals increasing euphoria and potential overextension. Therefore, the current Fear zone suggests a market that is still risk-averse but no longer in a state of maximum panic. Investors should consider the index as one tool among many. Key actions include: Assessing Personal Risk Tolerance: Does a Fear reading align with your investment horizon and strategy? Reviewing Asset Allocation: Sentiment shifts can be opportunities to rebalance portfolios methodically. Monitoring for Confirmation: Watch for supporting technical analysis or on-chain data to validate the sentiment shift. Avoiding Emotional Decisions: The index exists to quantify emotion, helping investors avoid being ruled by it. Ultimately, the index provides a crowd-sourced emotional temperature check. Its value lies in offering a structured, quantitative measure of a qualitative market factor, allowing for more disciplined decision-making. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 26 marks a meaningful, though incremental, improvement in overall market sentiment. This move from Extreme Fear to Fear reflects subtle positive changes across volatility, volume, social discourse, and search trends. While far from indicating greed or bullish euphoria, this shift suggests the intense pessimism that characterized recent months may be beginning to moderate. For astute observers, understanding this sentiment gauge provides crucial context, separating market noise from underlying emotional trends. As always, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an essential tool for navigating the complex psychological landscape of digital asset investing. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 26 mean? A score of 26 places market sentiment in the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that while investors remain cautious and risk-averse, the extreme panic associated with scores below 25 has subsided. This often corresponds with a market phase of consolidation and potentially reduced selling pressure. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how is it calculated? The index is compiled by the data provider Alternative.me. It uses a weighted formula based on six factors: volatility (25%), market volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to generate a single daily score from 0 to 100. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? No, the index is not a direct timing signal. It is a sentiment indicator. Extreme readings (below 10 or above 90) have historically signaled potential market turning points, but they should always be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis. Its primary value is in gauging market psychology. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily. Alternative.me typically publishes the new score based on data from the previous 24-hour period, allowing traders and analysts to track sentiment changes in near real-time. Q5: Has the index ever been wrong or misleading? Like all indicators, it is not infallible. Sentiment can remain in Extreme Fear or Extreme Greed for extended periods during strong bear or bull markets. It measures current emotion, not future price. Therefore, it should be interpreted as a context-providing tool rather than a predictive crystal ball.

This crucial metric, a barometer for market cycle phases, signals a period of pronounced Bitcoin strength relative to alternative cryptocurrencies. Consequently, investors and analysts closely monitor this index to gauge underlying sentiment shifts and potential rotation opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem. The current low score underscores a persistent narrative of Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal during uncertain macroeconomic climates. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Critical Market Thermometer CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index functions as a quantitative market thermometer. It systematically measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets, against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The methodology is straightforward yet powerful. Analysts calculate the percentage of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin during that period. Market participants declare an official “altcoin season” only when this percentage surpasses the 75% threshold. Therefore, a score of 22 indicates that merely 22% of major altcoins have beaten Bitcoin’s returns recently, firmly placing the market in a Bitcoin-dominant phase. This data-driven approach removes emotional bias from cycle analysis. Understanding this index requires historical context. For instance, during the bull market of late 2020 and early 2021, the index frequently hovered above 75, sometimes reaching 90+. That period witnessed explosive growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects. In contrast, the current reading aligns with phases where macroeconomic headwinds, such as interest rate policies and geopolitical tensions, drive investors toward Bitcoin’s perceived digital gold characteristics. This flight to quality often drains liquidity from higher-risk altcoin investments. Index Range Market Phase Interpretation Typical Investor Sentiment 0-24 Strong Bitcoin Season Risk-Off, Capital Preservation 25-49 Moderate Bitcoin Season Cautious, Selective Altcoin Allocation 50-74 Transition / Neutral Balanced, Awaiting Catalyst 75-100 Altcoin Season Risk-On, High Growth Seeking Historical Precedents and the Path to Altcoin Seasons Market cycles rarely shift abruptly. Historical data reveals that transitions from Bitcoin seasons to altcoin seasons often follow a recognizable pattern. Initially, Bitcoin leads a broad market rally, typically fueled by institutional adoption or macroeconomic triggers like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Subsequently, as Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher range, investor confidence grows. This confidence then fuels a search for higher beta opportunities, gradually rotating capital into altcoins. Key catalysts for this rotation have historically included: Technological Breakthroughs: The advent of smart contract platforms (Ethereum 2017), DeFi summer (2020), and the NFT boom (2021). Regulatory Clarity: Positive regulatory developments for specific blockchain use cases. Macro Liquidity Infusions: Periods of expansive monetary policy increasing risk appetite. Bitcoin Stability: Extended periods of low Bitcoin volatility, reducing its perceived trading advantage. Currently, the index at 22 suggests these catalysts are either absent or insufficient to overcome the prevailing risk-off sentiment. However, analysts note that such low readings can sometimes precede significant shifts, as extreme readings often mark sentiment capitulation points. Monitoring on-chain data for altcoin accumulation by large holders, known as whales, becomes crucial during these phases. Expert Analysis: Interpreting the 22 Reading in 2025’s Landscape Leading market analysts from firms like Glassnode and IntoTheBlock provide essential context for the current index reading. They correlate the low Altcoin Season Index with several observable on-chain and macroeconomic factors. First, Bitcoin’s dominance chart, which measures its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, has remained elevated above 55% for several consecutive months. Second, futures and options market data shows a pronounced skew toward Bitcoin-based derivatives, indicating institutional and sophisticated trader focus. Finally, capital flow metrics reveal net outflows from altcoin-focused investment products while Bitcoin products see sustained, if modest, inflows. This environment presents a dual reality. For long-term investors, a low index may signal a potential accumulation zone for high-conviction altcoin projects with strong fundamentals. Conversely, for short-term traders, it reinforces a strategy of following the dominant trend, which currently favors Bitcoin and perhaps a handful of mega-cap altcoins like Ethereum. The index, therefore, serves not as a timing tool but as a confirmation signal for broader market structure analysis. Strategic Implications for Crypto Portfolios and Market Outlook The persistent low Altcoin Season Index reading carries direct implications for portfolio management strategies. A disciplined, evidence-based approach is paramount in such conditions. Many portfolio managers advocate for a core-satellite model. This model maintains a significant core allocation to Bitcoin, aligning with the dominant trend indicated by the index. Simultaneously, it allows for smaller, strategic satellite allocations to altcoins with robust fundamentals, preparing for a future cycle shift. This method balances risk management with opportunity capture. Looking forward, several factors could catalyze a rise in the index. The continued maturation of layer-2 scaling solutions, which reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, could spur new user adoption for altcoin networks. Furthermore, the integration of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on blockchain platforms may drive fundamental utility and value. However, for the index to sustainably break above 50, the market likely requires a period of sustained Bitcoin stability combined with a clear, narrative-driving innovation within the altcoin ecosystem. Until then, the data suggests patience and selectivity are key virtues for market participants. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index, sitting definitively at 22, offers a data-rich snapshot of the 2025 cryptocurrency market structure. It confirms a phase of Bitcoin dominance, driven by macroeconomic caution and a focus on digital asset bedrock. While this reading may disappoint altcoin enthusiasts hoping for immediate, broad-based rallies, it provides invaluable clarity for strategic allocation. By understanding the mechanics and history behind this index, investors can navigate the current Bitcoin season with informed perspective, preparing portfolios for the eventual transition that historical cycles suggest will come. Monitoring this Altcoin Season Index, alongside fundamental on-chain metrics, remains essential for anyone engaged in the dynamic digital asset space. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 22 mean? An index reading of 22 means that only 22% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior 90 days. This falls far short of the 75% threshold needed to declare an “altcoin season,” indicating the market is currently in a phase strongly favoring Bitcoin. Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index in real-time, as it is calculated based on continuous price data for the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets) against Bitcoin’s performance. Q3: Can the market be in an altcoin season if Bitcoin’s price is also rising? Yes, absolutely. An altcoin season is defined by relative performance, not absolute price direction. During a true altcoin season, the majority of altcoins are rising at a significantly faster percentage rate than Bitcoin, even if Bitcoin itself is also in an uptrend. Q4: What are the main limitations of the Altcoin Season Index? The index focuses only on the top 100 assets by market cap, potentially missing trends in smaller-cap cryptocurrencies. It is also a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance and does not predict future movements. It should be used in conjunction with other fundamental and on-chain metrics. Q5: Does a low index reading mean all altcoins are performing poorly? Not necessarily. A low aggregate index reading can still coincide with strong performance in specific altcoin sectors or individual projects. It indicates that outperformance is not broad-based across the major assets, but niche areas like AI-driven tokens or specific layer-1 platforms may still be rallying independently.

This rapid liquidation event, occurring across multiple trading platforms, represents one of the most substantial hourly derivatives market contractions in recent months. According to aggregated exchange data, the total futures liquidation volume reached $257 million over the preceding 24-hour period, indicating sustained market pressure. Market analysts immediately began examining the underlying causes and potential implications for both institutional and retail traders navigating this volatile landscape. Crypto Futures Liquidated: Understanding the Market Mechanics Futures contracts represent binding agreements to buy or sell assets at predetermined prices on specific future dates. Traders utilize leverage, essentially borrowed capital, to amplify potential returns from price movements. Consequently, exchanges implement automatic liquidation protocols when positions approach critical loss thresholds. These protocols trigger forced position closures to prevent traders from losing more than their initial collateral. The recent $117 million liquidation event primarily affected long positions , where traders bet on price increases. Market data reveals Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives accounted for approximately 68% of the total liquidated value. This concentration highlights the outsized influence these major cryptocurrencies maintain within derivatives markets. Historical analysis demonstrates that significant liquidation clusters often precede or accompany substantial price corrections. For instance, similar events occurred during the May 2021 market downturn and the November 2022 FTX collapse aftermath. Market surveillance platforms recorded the most substantial liquidations on Binance, Bybit, and OKX exchanges. These platforms collectively handle the majority of global cryptocurrency derivatives trading volume. The rapid succession of liquidations created a cascading effect , where forced selling contributed to further price declines, triggering additional liquidations. This phenomenon, sometimes called a “liquidation spiral,” represents a critical risk factor in highly leveraged markets. Analyzing the Causes Behind Derivatives Market Volatility Multiple converging factors typically precipitate substantial liquidation events in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. First, unexpected price movements trigger margin calls when leveraged positions approach their liquidation prices. Second, increased market volatility elevates the probability of positions hitting these critical thresholds. Third, reduced liquidity during certain trading periods can exacerbate price swings. Current market analysis suggests several specific triggers contributed to today’s event. Regulatory announcements from multiple jurisdictions created uncertainty about future compliance requirements. Additionally, macroeconomic data releases influenced broader financial market sentiment, affecting cryptocurrency correlations with traditional assets. Technical analysis reveals that Bitcoin’s price approached several key support levels before the liquidation surge. These levels often concentrate stop-loss orders and liquidation triggers. When the price breached these technical thresholds, it activated a chain reaction of automated selling. The table below illustrates the distribution of liquidations across major cryptocurrencies during the peak hour: Cryptocurrency Liquidated Value (USD) Percentage of Total Primary Direction Bitcoin (BTC) $63 million 54% Long Ethereum (ETH) $17 million 14% Long Solana (SOL) $12 million 10% Mixed Other Altcoins $25 million 22% Predominantly Long Exchange representatives have confirmed their systems operated normally throughout the volatility. They emphasized that liquidation mechanisms functioned as designed to maintain market integrity. However, the concentration of liquidations within a narrow timeframe underscores the interconnected nature of modern cryptocurrency markets. Automated trading systems and algorithmic strategies can amplify price movements during periods of stress. Market participants must therefore implement robust risk management strategies when engaging with leveraged products. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure and Risk Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency derivatives emphasize several key considerations. First, leverage ratios directly influence liquidation probabilities. Higher leverage requires smaller adverse price movements to trigger margin calls. Second, market depth determines how significantly large liquidations impact prices. Thinner order books typically experience more pronounced price slippage during forced selling. Third, cross-margin and isolated margin arrangements offer different risk profiles for traders. Industry experts recommend several practices for navigating volatile derivatives markets: Implement conservative leverage : Using lower leverage ratios reduces liquidation risk during normal volatility Monitor funding rates : Sustained positive funding rates can indicate overcrowded long positions Diversify across exchanges : Spreading positions can mitigate platform-specific risks Utilize stop-loss orders strategically : Proper placement can prevent unexpected liquidations Maintain adequate collateral buffers : Additional margin provides protection against volatility Historical data analysis reveals patterns in liquidation events. Typically, clusters occur during periods of: Major regulatory announcements Significant macroeconomic data releases Technical breakdowns of key price levels Exchange-specific issues or outages Large, unexpected wallet movements Market surveillance firms track liquidation metrics as indicators of market stress. The estimated leverage ratio and open interest provide insights into market positioning. When open interest declines alongside prices during liquidations, it often signals position unwinding rather than simple profit-taking. Current metrics suggest the market absorbed the $117 million liquidation without systemic issues. However, the event serves as a reminder of the inherent risks in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis The cryptocurrency derivatives market has evolved significantly since Bitcoin futures launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. Initially, liquidation events frequently exceeded $1 billion during major market corrections. Market structure improvements and increased liquidity have generally reduced the frequency of such extreme events. However, the potential for rapid liquidations remains inherent to leveraged trading. Comparative analysis reveals today’s event ranks among the top 15 hourly liquidation events over the past three years. The most substantial recorded liquidation occurred in June 2022, exceeding $1 billion in a single hour during the Celsius Network crisis. Market participants have developed more sophisticated risk management tools since earlier liquidation events. Exchanges now offer: Advanced order types for precise position management Real-time liquidation price calculators Risk indicators and market sentiment tools Educational resources on derivatives trading mechanics Regulatory developments continue shaping the derivatives landscape. Jurisdictions increasingly focus on investor protection measures for leveraged products. Some regions have implemented leverage limits for retail traders, while others require enhanced risk disclosures. These regulatory changes aim to reduce excessive risk-taking while maintaining market functionality. The evolving regulatory environment represents a significant factor for derivatives market participants worldwide. Conclusion The $117 million crypto futures liquidated within one hour highlights the ongoing volatility and risk inherent in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. This event demonstrates how leveraged positions can rapidly unwind during price movements, creating cascading effects across exchanges. Market participants must understand liquidation mechanisms and implement appropriate risk management strategies. Historical context reveals that while such events create short-term turbulence, markets typically absorb them without long-term structural damage. Continued market evolution, including regulatory developments and improved risk tools, may reduce the frequency and severity of extreme liquidation events. However, the fundamental relationship between leverage, volatility, and liquidation risk remains a permanent feature of derivatives trading across all asset classes. FAQs Q1: What causes futures liquidations in cryptocurrency markets? Liquidations occur when leveraged positions lose enough value that they approach their liquidation price. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent losses exceeding the trader’s collateral, particularly during rapid price movements. Q2: How does a $117 million liquidation compare to historical events? While substantial, this event ranks moderately compared to historical extremes. The largest recorded hourly liquidation exceeded $1 billion in June 2022. Market structure improvements have generally reduced the frequency of billion-dollar liquidation events. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies were most affected by these liquidations? Bitcoin derivatives accounted for approximately 54% ($63 million) of the liquidated value, followed by Ethereum at 14% ($17 million). Solana and other altcoins comprised the remaining 32% of liquidations. Q4: Do liquidation events indicate market manipulation? Not necessarily. While market manipulation can trigger liquidations, most events result from normal volatility, technical breakdowns, or macroeconomic factors. Regulators and exchanges monitor for manipulative activities during volatile periods. Q5: How can traders protect against unexpected liquidations? Traders can use conservative leverage, maintain collateral buffers, employ strategic stop-loss orders, diversify across exchanges, and monitor market indicators like funding rates and open interest to manage liquidation risk.

This potential Venezuela Bitcoin president scenario represents a seismic shift for a nation grappling with hyperinflation and economic collapse, potentially positioning cryptocurrency at the center of national recovery efforts. Venezuela Bitcoin President Contender Emerges from Political Upheaval The political landscape in Venezuela transformed overnight following the detention of President Nicolás Maduro on international charges. Consequently, opposition figures previously marginalized or exiled now find themselves at the forefront of potential leadership transitions. Specifically, Maria Corina Machado, a 56-year-old human rights activist and political leader, has gained significant attention. According to Cointelegraph’s reporting, Machado represents a unique fusion of traditional political activism and innovative economic thinking. Her 2024 Nobel Peace Prize recognition for humanitarian work during Venezuela’s crisis provides international credibility. Meanwhile, her vocal advocacy for Bitcoin as an economic solution distinguishes her from conventional candidates. Prediction markets currently reflect this shifting reality. The U.S.-based platform Kalshi assigns Machado a 28% probability of becoming Venezuela’s next leader. This places her second only to Edmundo González Urrutia, who holds a 32% probability. González Urrutia, another opposition figure, contested last year’s presidential election before entering exile amid fraud allegations. The narrow margin between these two contenders suggests a highly competitive political environment. Furthermore, it highlights how cryptocurrency policy has become a defining issue in Venezuela’s future direction. Bitcoin as Economic Lifeline in Hyperinflation Crisis Venezuela’s economic collapse provides crucial context for understanding Machado’s cryptocurrency advocacy. The country has experienced one of modern history’s most severe hyperinflation episodes. The International Monetary Fund reported annual inflation exceeding 1,000,000% in recent years. This economic devastation has eroded savings, destroyed purchasing power, and created widespread poverty. In response, many Venezuelans have turned to alternative financial systems. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained significant adoption as stores of value and means of transaction. Machado has consistently framed Bitcoin as more than just digital currency. She describes it as a “technology for freedom” that could address systemic economic problems. Her platform emphasizes three specific mechanisms through which cryptocurrency could benefit Venezuela: Property Rights Protection: Blockchain technology creates immutable records of ownership Inflation Resistance: Bitcoin’s fixed supply contrasts with bolívar’s unlimited printing Equal Opportunity Access: Digital wallets require only internet access, not traditional banking These proposals resonate with citizens who have experienced financial exclusion and currency devaluation. Additionally, they align with broader trends in developing economies where cryptocurrency adoption often correlates with economic instability. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency in Venezuela Venezuela’s relationship with cryptocurrency predates current political developments. The Maduro government launched the Petro cryptocurrency in 2018, though this state-backed digital currency faced international sanctions and limited adoption. Meanwhile, organic Bitcoin usage grew significantly among the population. Chainalysis data from 2023 ranked Venezuela third globally in cryptocurrency adoption relative to wealth and population. This existing infrastructure could facilitate policy implementation should a pro-Bitcoin candidate assume power. Political Landscape and Leadership Probabilities The current leadership probabilities reveal Venezuela’s complex political dynamics. The following table compares the two leading contenders according to Kalshi prediction markets: Candidate Probability Key Characteristics Cryptocurrency Position Edmundo González Urrutia 32% Traditional opposition leader, exiled after election fraud allegations No public cryptocurrency statements Maria Corina Machado 28% Nobel Peace Prize laureate, human rights activist, economic innovator Pro-Bitcoin platform emphasizing economic freedom This four-percentage-point difference indicates substantial uncertainty about Venezuela’s political future. Moreover, it suggests that cryptocurrency policy could become a decisive factor in any election or transition process. International observers closely monitor these developments because Venezuela represents a potential test case for cryptocurrency integration at the national level. Global Implications of Cryptocurrency Political Leadership A potential Venezuela Bitcoin president carries significance beyond national borders. Several countries with economic challenges observe Venezuela’s experiment with interest. El Salvador established precedent in 2021 by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. However, a major economy like Venezuela embracing cryptocurrency would represent a different scale of adoption. Financial analysts note that Venezuela possesses the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Therefore, any cryptocurrency integration could involve energy production considerations. International reactions to these developments remain mixed. The United States government has not commented specifically on Machado’s cryptocurrency proposals. However, previous statements indicate concern about cryptocurrency use evading sanctions. Conversely, cryptocurrency advocates globally celebrate the possibility of national-level adoption. Industry leaders emphasize that Venezuela’s situation demonstrates cryptocurrency’s practical utility in crisis conditions. This real-world validation could influence policy debates in other nations experiencing economic stress. Expert Perspectives on Economic Transition Economic analysts provide cautious assessments of cryptocurrency integration scenarios. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a Latin American economics specialist at Georgetown University, notes: “Venezuela requires comprehensive monetary reform. Cryptocurrency could play a role in this process, but it cannot single-handedly solve structural economic problems. Successful implementation would require careful regulation, financial education, and infrastructure development.” This perspective highlights the complexity of national cryptocurrency adoption. It also underscores that political leadership represents only one component of successful economic transformation. Conclusion The emergence of Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado as a leading Venezuela Bitcoin president contender marks a pivotal moment in global cryptocurrency evolution. Her candidacy represents the intersection of political change, economic crisis, and technological innovation. While prediction markets currently show a competitive race, the mere possibility of cryptocurrency-focused leadership in a major economy signals shifting global attitudes. Venezuela’s experience with hyperinflation and financial exclusion provides unique context for Bitcoin advocacy. Ultimately, the nation’s political direction will influence not only its citizens but also international perceptions of cryptocurrency’s role in national economies. The coming months will determine whether Venezuela becomes the world’s most significant test case for cryptocurrency integration at the sovereign level. FAQs Q1: What makes Maria Corina Machado’s candidacy significant for cryptocurrency? Machado represents the first major political candidate explicitly advocating Bitcoin as a national economic solution. Her Nobel Peace Prize recognition provides international credibility, while Venezuela’s hyperinflation crisis creates practical urgency for alternative financial systems. Q2: How has Bitcoin adoption progressed in Venezuela before this political development? Venezuela ranked third globally in cryptocurrency adoption relative to population and wealth in 2023. Many citizens use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to preserve savings and conduct transactions amid bolívar hyperinflation, creating existing infrastructure for potential policy implementation. Q3: What challenges would a pro-Bitcoin president face in Venezuela? Major challenges include international sanctions considerations, technological infrastructure limitations, financial literacy gaps, potential opposition from traditional financial institutions, and the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks alongside cryptocurrency adoption. Q4: How does Machado’s probability compare to other candidates? Prediction markets currently assign Machado a 28% probability versus 32% for frontrunner Edmundo González Urrutia. This narrow margin indicates competitive uncertainty, with cryptocurrency policy potentially becoming a decisive factor in Venezuela’s political future. Q5: What broader implications might Venezuela’s cryptocurrency direction have globally? Venezuela represents a potential test case for cryptocurrency integration at national scale in a major economy. Successful implementation could influence policy in other developing nations experiencing economic instability, while also shaping international regulatory discussions about cryptocurrency’s role in sovereign finance.

56831149,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258352,1767578710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: Remarkable Rally Propels BTC Above $93,000 Milestone",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-soars-above-93000-milestone/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: Remarkable Rally Propels BTC Above $93,000 Milestone In a significant development for digital asset markets, Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a notable milestone, breaking above the $93,000 threshold. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier cryptocurrency reached a price of $93,014.62 on the Binance USDT trading pair. This price movement, recorded on April 10, 2025, marks a key moment in the ongoing evolution of the crypto market and invites a deeper analysis of the underlying factors and potential implications. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Psychological Barrier The ascent past $93,000 represents more than a numerical achievement. Consequently, it serves as a powerful psychological signal to the global investment community. Market analysts immediately scrutinized trading volumes and order book depth for confirmation. Historically, such round-number levels often act as both resistance and support. Therefore, a clean break can trigger further momentum. The move was characterized by steady buying pressure rather than a speculative spike. This suggests a degree of institutional confidence often absent in more volatile rallies. For context, Bitcoin’s journey to this point has been multifaceted. The asset recovered from a significant bear market in the preceding years. Its performance often correlates with macro-economic factors like inflation data and monetary policy. Furthermore, adoption metrics from both retail and corporate entities show consistent growth. This price level reactivates discussions about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a digital store of value. Analyzing the Current Cryptocurrency Rally Bitcoin’s surge does not exist in a vacuum. The broader digital asset market frequently experiences correlated movements. However, Bitcoin often leads the trend. Several concurrent factors provide context for this rally: Institutional Inflows: Recent filings with regulatory bodies show increased exposure from traditional finance firms. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in key jurisdictions has reduced uncertainty for large investors. Network Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s hash rate, a measure of network security, remains near all-time highs. Macroeconomic Hedge: Some investors continue to view crypto as a hedge against currency devaluation. Market sentiment, as measured by several established indices, shifted from neutral to cautiously optimistic in the weeks preceding this move. Trading activity on both spot and derivatives markets increased notably. This indicates participation from diverse trader profiles. Importantly, the rally has so far avoided the hallmarks of excessive leverage that characterized past bubbles. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure Financial analysts emphasize the changing nature of Bitcoin demand. A decade ago, retail speculation dominated price discovery. Today, the landscape includes: Participant Type Primary Influence Typical Time Horizon Long-Term Holders Supply Reduction Years Institutional Funds Large Volume Orders Months to Years Active Traders Short-Term Volatility Days to Weeks Corporate Treasuries Strategic Allocation Indefinite This diversified base potentially contributes to more stable price appreciation. Experts from major financial research firms point to on-chain data. This data shows coins moving from exchanges to long-term storage solutions. Such movement typically reduces immediate sell-side pressure. Meanwhile, the development of regulated financial products continues to bridge traditional and crypto finance. Historical Context and Future Trajectories Understanding this $93,000 price requires a look at Bitcoin’s history. The asset has experienced multiple cycles of expansion and contraction. Each cycle reached a new nominal high, though the rate of growth has moderated over time. Previous all-time highs, such as those near $69,000, became consolidation zones before the next advance. The current macroeconomic environment differs markedly from past cycles. Global debt levels, interest rate policies, and geopolitical tensions create a unique backdrop. Technological developments also play a crucial role. The Bitcoin network has undergone several major upgrades. These upgrades improve scalability and programmability without compromising its core security model. The ecosystem of layer-two solutions, like the Lightning Network, now facilitates faster and cheaper transactions. This practical utility supports the asset’s valuation beyond pure speculation. Consequently, analysts assess price targets not just on historical patterns but on these evolving fundamentals. The Impact on the Broader Digital Asset Ecosystem Bitcoin’s performance invariably influences the entire cryptocurrency sector. Often termed ‘digital gold,’ its price strength can boost sentiment across the board. However, the relationship is not always linear. Some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) may outperform in a strong Bitcoin market, while others may lag. This period has seen selective capital rotation. Investors appear to be rewarding projects with clear utility and sustainable tokenomics. The total market capitalization of all crypto assets has increased in tandem with Bitcoin’s rise. This reinforces the notion of Bitcoin as a market bellwether. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $93,000 signifies a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency market. This milestone, driven by a complex mix of institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors, and strong network fundamentals, underscores the asset’s maturing role in global finance. While price movements attract headlines, the underlying story involves technological progress and shifting investor demographics. The Bitcoin price at this level reflects a market that is increasingly integrated with traditional finance yet remains distinct in its potential. Observers will now monitor whether this level consolidates as a new support zone, setting the stage for the next phase of the digital asset evolution. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $93,000 mean for the average investor? It primarily indicates heightened mainstream and institutional attention. For an average investor, it underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s volatility and conducting thorough research before considering any allocation, no matter how small. Q2: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $93,000 level represents a new all-time high in nominal terms, surpassing the previous record set in the last market cycle. In inflation-adjusted terms, comparisons depend on the chosen benchmark currency and timeframe. Q3: What are the main risks associated with Bitcoin at this price level? Key risks include high volatility, regulatory changes in major economies, technological risks (though minimal for Bitcoin’s base layer), macroeconomic shifts that reduce its appeal as a hedge, and potential market corrections after rapid appreciation. Q4: Does a high Bitcoin price affect transaction fees and speed? The Bitcoin price itself does not directly affect network fees or transaction speed. These are determined by network congestion and the fee market. However, periods of high price often coincide with increased network usage, which can raise fees. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data on Bitcoin’s price and market metrics? Reliable data comes from transparent, high-volume exchanges (like the Binance USDT market cited), aggregated price indices from sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, and on-chain analytics platforms that track network fundamentals beyond just price.

This substantial transaction, identified by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, highlights the evolving financial strategies of major industry players. Consequently, it provides a tangible case study in corporate Bitcoin treasury management. The transfer occurred amidst a period of relative stability for the flagship cryptocurrency. Therefore, analysts are scrutinizing the move for potential signals about institutional liquidity needs and market-making activities. Analyzing the MARA Holdings Bitcoin Transfer The transaction originated from a digital wallet address widely associated with MARA Holdings’ corporate treasury. Blockchain data confirms the transfer of exactly 288 BTC to a destination wallet tagged to Wintermute Trading. Market makers like Wintermute provide essential liquidity to cryptocurrency exchanges. They facilitate smoother trading by continuously quoting buy and sell prices. This specific transfer likely represents a strategic allocation for liquidity provision or over-the-counter (OTC) trading purposes. MARA Holdings, formally known as Marathon Digital Holdings, operates as one of the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies in North America. The company follows a strategy of holding a significant portion of the Bitcoin it mines. This approach turns it into a notable corporate holder of the digital asset. Regular transactions from its treasury are common. However, transfers of this scale to a specific market maker warrant closer examination for their market implications. Context and Implications for Crypto Markets This transaction occurs within a broader context of increasing institutional involvement in cryptocurrency markets. Large transfers between established entities often precede or coincide with heightened trading activity. For instance, market makers require substantial capital reserves to fulfill their role effectively. A direct infusion of Bitcoin from a miner can streamline this process. It avoids the need for intermediate steps on public exchanges, which could cause price slippage. Expert Perspective on Treasury Management Industry analysts frequently monitor wallets of public mining companies like MARA Holdings. Their transactions offer insights into corporate strategy and market sentiment. A transfer to a market maker, rather than a direct sale on an exchange, suggests a desire for efficient execution. It may also indicate preparation for facilitating large client orders or hedging activities. According to common treasury management principles, such moves are often planned to minimize market impact. They reflect a sophisticated approach to handling digital asset reserves. The following table outlines key details of the transaction as reported: Metric Detail Sending Entity Presumed MARA Holdings Treasury Wallet Receiving Entity Wintermute Trading Wallet Amount (BTC) 288 Approximate USD Value $26.3 Million Data Source Lookonchain Blockchain Analytics Timeframe Approximately 9 hours prior to report Several potential motivations could explain this Bitcoin transfer: Liquidity Provision: Wintermute may use the BTC to bolster quotes on various trading platforms. OTC Desk Supply: The coins could supply an over-the-counter desk for large institutional trades. Collateral for Derivatives: The Bitcoin might serve as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) or futures markets. Strategic Rebalancing: MARA Holdings could be actively managing its treasury assets. The Role of Market Makers Like Wintermute Wintermute operates as a leading global algorithmic trading firm specializing in digital assets. The company’s core function involves providing liquidity across numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and trading venues. This activity is crucial for a healthy market. It reduces the spread between buy and sell orders, which ultimately lowers costs for all traders. Receiving a direct transfer from a primary source like a miner is efficient. It allows Wintermute to source assets without affecting the public order books. Furthermore, such partnerships between miners and market makers are becoming more formalized. They represent a maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s infrastructure. Miners gain a reliable channel for monetizing their mined coins with minimal disruption. Simultaneously, market makers secure a direct supply of assets. This symbiotic relationship supports overall market stability and efficiency. Impact on Bitcoin Network and Miner Behavior Transactions of this size are routine for the Bitcoin network, which easily handles much larger value transfers daily. However, they are significant within the context of miner economics. Public mining companies face constant scrutiny from shareholders regarding their Bitcoin holdings and sales strategies. A transparent, strategic transfer to a known counterparty like Wintermute can be viewed as a responsible treasury action. It contrasts with panic selling during market downturns, which can exacerbate price declines. Monitoring these flows helps analysts gauge selling pressure from miners. If many large miners began moving coins to exchanges en masse, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially impacting price. Conversely, a transfer to a market maker is more neutral. It indicates operational activity rather than a direct bearish sentiment. This distinction is important for accurate market analysis. Conclusion The $26.3 million Bitcoin transfer from MARA Holdings to Wintermute underscores the sophisticated financial operations now commonplace in the cryptocurrency sector. This transaction reflects a strategic move for liquidity management rather than a simple asset sale. It highlights the deepening integration between Bitcoin mining operations and secondary market infrastructure. As the industry evolves, such transparent, large-scale transfers between credible entities will likely become more frequent. They demonstrate the professionalization of digital asset treasury management. Ultimately, this MARA Holdings Bitcoin transfer serves as a marker of the market’s ongoing maturation and institutional confidence. FAQs Q1: What is the significance of MARA Holdings transferring BTC to Wintermute? This transfer is significant because it involves a major public Bitcoin miner moving a large sum directly to a leading market maker. It suggests a strategic partnership for liquidity provision, highlighting how large players manage digital treasuries efficiently outside of public exchanges. Q2: Does this Bitcoin transfer indicate MARA Holdings is selling its Bitcoin? Not necessarily. A transfer to a market maker like Wintermute is different from a direct sale on an exchange. Wintermute likely uses the BTC to provide trading liquidity or facilitate large OTC trades. The move is more about treasury management and operational efficiency than an outright sale. Q3: How do analysts track transactions like this? Analysts use blockchain explorers and analytics platforms like Lookonchain, which tag wallet addresses associated with known entities (e.g., companies, exchanges). By monitoring flows to and from these tagged addresses, they can infer institutional activity and market trends. Q4: What is a crypto market maker, and what does Wintermute do? A crypto market maker is a firm that provides liquidity by continuously placing buy and sell orders on exchanges. Wintermute is a major algorithmic trading firm that performs this role, helping to ensure markets are deep and stable for all participants by narrowing bid-ask spreads. Q5: Could this large transfer affect the price of Bitcoin? A direct transfer between two private entities typically has no immediate direct impact on the public market price. The impact would occur if Wintermute used the coins to execute large sell orders on exchanges. The strategic nature of this transfer aims to minimize such market disruption.

Livingston made this statement after discovering that Japan’s total debt , in comparison to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), is approximately 250%, marking a substantial rise in Japan’s debt level in its history. At this high level, reports highlighted that the yen continues to weaken, as the government is required to print a considerable amount of money every year to address deficits, which causes heavier debt and lowers the yen’s value. Livingston points out the impacts of a weaker yen on the industry Reports from reliable sources indicate that the value of Bitcoin has increased by approximately 1,159% since 2020. This rise was identified when the cryptocurrency’s value was measured in US dollars. Nonetheless, Livingston noted that BTC’s increase is approximately 1,704% compared to the Japanese yen. Concerning the claim that Metaplanet might enjoy financial advantages over other firms, analysts began by acknowledging that if the yen is weaker, the company’s debts are tied to a currency with less value than the dollar. This situation makes financing readily available for Metaplanet at an affordable cost for each unit of fiat currency it utilizes. Another discovery that was made public was the fact that Metaplanet makes payments for each coupon using a currency whose value is diminishing compared to that of BTC and USD. Consequently, the real cost of its 4.9% coupon in Bitcoin continues to decrease while Strategy makes payments of its 10% coupon in dollars, utilizing a stronger currency; hence, the firm’s liabilities decline at a slow pace. It is worth noting that this analysis was conducted during a global decline in crypto treasury firms. Some of these companies have observed a decrease in their values of more than 90% from their peak. The crypto markets, on the other hand, are facing difficulties recovering and achieving new highs after a major crash in October 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Treasuries data disclosed that Metaplanet currently owns approximately 35,102 BTC in reserve. With this achievement, the company solidified its position among the top-ranked firms as the fourth-largest Bitcoin treasury company, measured by its Bitcoin holdings. For its latest purchase, sources mentioned that the firm bought approximately 4,279 units of BTC on Tuesday of last week, adding to its reserve for around $451 million. However, the current situation in the company has sparked heated debates among individuals who have raised concerns, wondering why Metaplanet’s stock price has dropped despite making such a significant move in its Bitcoin purchase. Additionally, they observed that the rest of the crypto treasury sector also declined. This sector comprises key players in the industry, such as Strategy — the largest BTC treasury company — BitMine, Nakamoto, and others. Metaplanet implements a significant move in the crypto space In December 2025, Metaplanet made several amendments to its capital structure. This move made it easier for Japan’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin to collect funds by issuing preferred shares that pay dividends, drawing the attention of several institutional investors. As a result of this change, Dylan LeClair, the company’s director of Bitcoin strategy, noted that investors supported five proposals that collectively enhanced Metaplanet’s ability to offer preferred shares, introduce new dividend alternatives, and attract participation from international institutional investors. Notably, this approved adjustment involves reclassifying capital reserves to facilitate the payment of preferred share dividends and potentially repurchasing shares.

Griggs said the company decided to go in after the Trump administration put out clear rules and brought in regulators who support crypto. “PwC has to be in that ecosystem,” Griggs told the Financial Times. The full pivot happened in 2024 after regulators changed and Congress passed new crypto laws. Griggs said the Genius Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, gave the company and others legal clarity for the first time. The law regulates stablecoins and opens the way for banks to issue their own. That legal change, paired with Trump’s appointment of Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, gave Big Four companies like PwC the signal to stop sitting out. The Biden-era hostility toward crypto is now gone. PwC now advises crypto clients on audits, taxes, and payments Griggs said the company feels “a responsibility to be hyper-engaged on both sides of the business,” adding: “Whether we are doing work in the audit space or doing work in the consulting arena — we do all the above in crypto — we see more and more opportunities coming our way.” Griggs also said the company now offers full crypto services, from accounting to strategy. Until now, PwC and the rest of the Big Four were reluctant to take on crypto companies in the US.They put up high barriers and turned down most of them.That was partly because US regulators were skeptical of the entire industry, constantly concerned about fraud, money laundering, and consumer risks. But with the Trump administration now backing the space, those companies are treating crypto like any other line of business. Griggs said PwC has been pitching to clients how they can use crypto tools to make things work better, especially around payments.He said stablecoins are one way to make payments faster and more efficient. This pitch comes as companies scramble to find new ways to cut costs and speed up operations, especially with banking rails still outdated. Other Big Four companies aren’t waiting around either. Deloitte has been auditing Coinbase since 2020 and put out a full crypto accounting guide in May. KPMG called 2025 the “tipping point” for crypto and now sells compliance and risk advisory tied to crypto use. All of them are now targeting this once-taboo industry for serious money. PwC expands crypto hires and lands big clients like Mara Griggs also revealed that PwC has already picked up audit clients in the crypto industry. That includes Mara Holdings, a bitcoin mining company that appointed the company in March. He said the company is also offering crypto tax advice, helping clients figure out how to handle digital income, transactions, and legal structures under the new US laws. Griggs was promoted to US senior partner in 2024 after working at PwC for nearly 30 years. He used to handle the audit for Goldman Sachs and also ran some of the company’s internal talent programs. Now he’s trying to make sure PwC doesn’t fall behind in a growing part of the market. To do that, he said the company had to hire from outside. One of those hires is Cheryl Lesnik, who rejoined the company after three years away. She had spent that time focused on crypto clients at a smaller accounting outfit. Now she’s helping build PwC’s crypto team from the inside. Griggs made it clear they’re not winging it. “We are never going to lean into a business that we haven’t equipped ourselves to deliver,” he said. “Over the last 10 to 12 months, as we’ve taken on more opportunities in that digital assets arena, we’ve bolstered our resource pool inside and outside.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Business|Crypto|PwC,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56833040,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258372,1767582611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Liquidations Surge: Short Positions Devastated in $155M Market Squeeze,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/short-positions-dominate-crypto-liquidations/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations Surge: Short Positions Devastated in $155M Market Squeeze Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a dramatic and forceful liquidation event on March 21, 2025, as over $155 million in leveraged positions were forcibly closed within a single 24-hour period. This significant market movement was overwhelmingly dominated by the unraveling of short positions, signaling a powerful counter-trend rally that caught a vast number of traders on the wrong side of the market. The data reveals a clear narrative of a coordinated short squeeze impacting the flagship digital assets Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), with profound implications for market structure and trader sentiment moving forward. Crypto Liquidations Reach a Critical Mass The perpetual futures market, a cornerstone of cryptocurrency derivatives trading, experienced intense volatility. Consequently, exchanges automatically closed leveraged positions that fell below their maintenance margin requirements. This process, known as liquidation, protects lenders from losses but can exacerbate price movements. The aggregate value of $155 million is substantial, indicating a high degree of leverage was present in the market. Furthermore, the extreme skew toward short liquidations—where traders betting on price declines were forced to buy back assets—acted as a potent accelerant for the rally. This created a feedback loop; liquidations drove prices higher, triggering more liquidations. Market analysts often scrutinize liquidation clusters to gauge potential turning points. A cluster of short liquidations, as seen here, typically suggests that pessimistic sentiment had become overly crowded. When the market reverses, it triggers a cascade. Key metrics from this event include: Total Liquidations: $155 million across all cryptocurrencies. Short vs. Long Ratio: An overwhelming majority were short position liquidations. Market Impact: The forced buying from liquidations provided significant upward pressure on spot prices. Bitcoin Leads the Charge with $91.55M in Liquidations Bitcoin, the market’s primary benchmark, accounted for the lion’s share of the liquidation volume. Specifically, $91.55 million in BTC perpetual futures positions were wiped out. Astonishingly, short positions constituted 94.24% of this total. This translates to approximately $86.3 million in forced buying of Bitcoin as these leveraged shorts were closed. Such a lopsided figure highlights a massive misalignment between trader positioning and short-term price action. The scale of BTC short liquidations often serves as a catalyst for broader market movements, as Bitcoin’s dominance influences altcoin trajectories. The event coincided with several macroeconomic catalysts, including shifting expectations around central bank monetary policy and institutional accumulation patterns observed in on-chain data. Historically, similar short squeeze events in Bitcoin have preceded periods of sustained bullish momentum, as they effectively remove a key source of selling pressure and can force traders to reposition. The velocity of this move underscores the inherent risks of high leverage in an asset class known for its volatility. Ethereum and Solana Follow the Pattern The liquidation wave was not isolated to Bitcoin. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, mirrored the trend with $51.81 million in liquidations. Within this, short positions made up 85.67%, or about $44.4 million. This simultaneous squeeze across both major assets suggests a macro-driven shift in sentiment rather than an asset-specific issue. The Ethereum network’s ongoing developments, including progress on scalability upgrades, may have contributed to a fundamental reassessment by the market. Solana, a prominent layer-1 blockchain, also experienced significant pressure on its short sellers. SOL liquidations totaled $11.76 million, with a staggering 91.44% stemming from short positions. The high percentage indicates that short interest in SOL was particularly concentrated, making it vulnerable to a sharp reversal. This activity often reflects the higher beta nature of altcoins like Solana, which tend to experience amplified volatility relative to Bitcoin. 24-Hour Liquidation Snapshot (March 21, 2025) Asset Total Liquidations Short Percentage Short Value Bitcoin (BTC) $91.55M 94.24% ~$86.3M Ethereum (ETH) $51.81M 85.67% ~$44.4M Solana (SOL) $11.76M 91.44% ~$10.75M Market Total ~$155M Dominantly Short ~$141.5M Understanding the Mechanics of a Short Squeeze A short squeeze is a pivotal market phenomenon. It occurs when an asset’s price begins to rise rapidly, and traders who have borrowed and sold that asset (shorted it) face mounting losses. To limit these losses, they must buy the asset back to close their position. This mandatory buying adds further demand, pushing the price even higher and forcing more short sellers to cover. The perpetual futures market, with its high leverage and funding rate mechanism, is especially prone to these volatile cascades. The funding rate, a periodic payment between long and short positions, can turn sharply negative during strong rallies, increasing the cost for those holding shorts and hastening their exit. This recent event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with derivative trading. While leverage can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses and reduces a trader’s margin for error. Market infrastructure, including exchange risk engines and liquidity depth, is critically tested during such events. Regulators and institutional observers closely monitor these liquidations to assess systemic risk within the growing crypto derivatives ecosystem. Historical Context and Market Implications Comparable liquidation events have marked key inflection points in previous market cycles. For instance, significant short squeezes often cluster at the end of prolonged bearish trends, signaling capitulation from the downside. The scale of this event, while notable, remains below the historic liquidation spikes seen during the bull market of 2021 or the LUNA collapse of 2022, suggesting a more contained, albeit sharp, correction in positioning. The immediate implication is a reset of leverage in the system. A flush of short positions reduces immediate selling pressure and can pave the way for a more stable price advance. However, it also leaves the market potentially vulnerable to a long liquidation cascade if the price momentum reverses. Traders will now monitor open interest and funding rates to see if bullish leverage begins to build excessively, setting the stage for a potential long squeeze on any downturn. Expert Analysis on Derivative Market Health Derivatives analysts emphasize that while painful for affected traders, these periodic liquidations are a healthy mechanism for the market. They prevent unsustainable leverage from building indefinitely and help realign prices with underlying spot market flows. The dominance of short liquidations indicates that the market efficiently purged pessimistic bets, potentially creating a cleaner foundation for price discovery. Furthermore, the event demonstrates the increasing maturity of crypto derivatives markets, where large liquidations can occur without causing widespread exchange insolvencies or permanent market damage, a sign of improved risk management since earlier years. Conclusion The $155 million crypto liquidation event, overwhelmingly dominated by short positions, represents a significant market reset. The forceful squeeze across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana underscores the powerful dynamics of leveraged derivatives trading. This event removed a substantial layer of short-side pressure, potentially altering the near-term technical landscape. For market participants, it reinforces the critical importance of risk management, especially when utilizing leverage in a volatile asset class. As the market digests this move, attention will shift to whether this marks a sustainable shift in trend or a temporary volatility spike. The data on crypto liquidations provides a clear, quantitative snapshot of a day where the market forcefully corrected a major imbalance in trader sentiment. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a short position is liquidated? A1: A short position is liquidated when a trader who borrowed and sold an asset, betting its price would fall, experiences losses as the price rises. If the loss erodes their collateral (margin) below a required level, the exchange automatically buys back the asset to close the position, limiting further loss for the lender. This forced buying can push prices higher. Q2: Why are short liquidations considered bullish for the market? A2: Short liquidations are considered bullish in the short term because they involve mandatory buying to close positions. This buying pressure can accelerate a price rally. Furthermore, they eliminate a pool of traders expecting lower prices, reducing potential selling pressure once the rally begins. Q3: What is a perpetual futures contract? A3: A perpetual futures contract is a derivative product that allows traders to speculate on an asset’s price without an expiry date. Positions are maintained through a funding rate mechanism, where traders on one side of the market periodically pay those on the other side, ensuring the contract price stays anchored to the spot price. Q4: How can traders monitor liquidation risk? A4: Traders can monitor liquidation risk using tools that track aggregate leverage, funding rates, and liquidation price clusters across exchanges. High open interest combined with extreme funding rates or a large volume of positions with liquidation prices near the current market price indicates elevated risk of a squeeze. Q5: Did this liquidation event only affect retail traders? A5: While detailed breakdowns are not always public, liquidation events of this scale typically affect a mix of retail and institutional leveraged positions. The sheer volume suggests institutional desks and large whales were likely involved, not just retail traders.

The recovery in crypto came as investors weighed the implications of Washington’s move to seize control of the oil-rich nation. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,947, up 1.2% Ether : $3,163, up 0.4% XRP : $2.12, up 3.1% Total crypto market cap: $3.23 trillion, up 0.9% President Donald Trump said over the weekend that the US had placed Venezuela under temporary American control, following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. US authorities said Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were flown to New York and charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other crimes. An indictment alleged that drug trafficking had enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite. Oil Retreats As Traders Gauge Supply Fallout From Venezuela Crisis The sudden escalation rattled energy markets early in the session. Brent crude slid more than 1% at one point before trimming losses, and was last trading about 0.25% lower. West Texas Intermediate fell roughly 0.4% as traders assessed how the intervention could disrupt supply from a country that holds the world’s largest proven crude reserves. Oil drops as traders weigh the fallout from the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US forces on global crude supply https://t.co/yZNmHhTKM2 — Bloomberg (@business) January 4, 2026 Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, accounts for about 303B barrels of oil, roughly 17% of global reserves, according to US Energy Information Administration data, a reminder of why oil prices reacted swiftly to the news. Regional Stocks Strengthen As Japan Rebounds And Risk Appetite Firms Asia-Pacific equities, however, leaned into risk. MSCI’s broad index of shares outside Japan climbed about 1.2%, while S&P 500 e-mini futures edged 0.1% higher, signalling a cautiously positive handoff to Wall Street. Japan led regional gains, with the Nikkei surging 2.8% and moving back toward a record high reached two months ago. The rally followed data showing factory activity stabilised in December, snapping five months of contraction. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s benchmark rose more than 2% each to fresh record highs. Hong Kong stocks were more subdued, up 0.1%, weighed down by oil majors after a gauge of energy shares slid 3.1%. Australian shares added a modest 0.1%. Crypto Upswing Builds As ETFs Attract Fresh Capital Crypto traders viewed the geopolitical shock through a different lens. The market’s rebound reflected a renewed bid for alternative assets as investors repositioned around risk. Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said the broader trend in digital assets had turned decisively higher following the developments in Venezuela. “The rally is supported by a strong return of institutional interest, with crypto ETFs recording about $646M in net inflows on the first trading day of the year after December’s heavy selling,” he said. “Sentiment is also improving, as the Fear-Greed Index turned neutral for the first time since October.

This development emerges directly following the dramatic U.S. arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, triggering urgent questions about state-level crypto adoption for sanctions evasion. Meanwhile, confirmed on-chain data presents a far more modest public picture of just 240 BTC, creating a profound mystery that international investigators vow to unravel. Venezuela Bitcoin Mystery: The $60 Billion Speculation Financial analysts and blockchain investigators currently face a significant puzzle. Reports from Blockmedia and other financial intelligence outlets suggest Venezuela systematically accumulated Bitcoin and Tether over several years. The alleged purpose was creating a sovereign digital asset reserve completely outside the traditional global banking system. Consequently, this reserve could theoretically fund government operations and imports despite crippling international sanctions. However, these claims rely heavily on anonymous sources and analysis of opaque financial networks rather than transparent blockchain evidence. For context, a $60 billion Bitcoin holding would represent an unprecedented state crypto treasury. To illustrate, this amount would exceed the publicly disclosed foreign reserves of numerous nations. The speculation originates from tracing complex transactions through cryptocurrency exchanges and peer-to-peer platforms that allegedly serviced Venezuelan state entities. Furthermore, investigators point to the country’s early and aggressive promotion of the Petro, its national cryptocurrency, as evidence of institutional crypto expertise that could facilitate such accumulation. On-Chain Reality Versus Off-Chain Speculation The publicly verifiable data tells a markedly different story. Blockchain analysis firms confirm identifiable Venezuelan state wallets hold approximately 240 BTC, valued around $15 million at current prices. This glaring discrepancy between rumored billions and confirmed millions forms the core of the investigation. Experts propose several explanations for this data gap. Obfuscated Holdings: The state could use advanced techniques like chain-hopping, privacy coins, or custodial services to hide transactions. Private Key Distribution: Assets might be distributed across thousands of wallets under individual names rather than a single state wallet. Off-Chain Agreements: Holdings could exist as IOUs or balances on private, permissioned ledgers not visible on public blockchains. Exaggerated Estimates: The $60 billion figure might stem from miscalculated transaction volumes or intentional misinformation. Blockchain forensic analyst, Dr. Elena Torres, whose firm tracks state-level crypto activity, provided crucial insight. “The technical capability to obscure large-scale holdings absolutely exists,” Torres explained. “Nation-states now employ the same mixing services and decentralized exchanges that illicit actors use. Therefore, proving or disproving these claims requires subpoena power over global exchanges, not just blockchain analysis.” Geopolitical Context: Sanctions and Financial Survival Venezuela’s economic context makes cryptocurrency an attractive, albeit risky, tool. The United States and European Union imposed severe financial sanctions over the past decade, effectively locking the country out of the SWIFT banking network. These measures aimed to pressure the Maduro government on human rights and democratic standards. In response, Venezuela explored multiple financial alternatives. The timeline below shows key events leading to the current speculation: Year Event Cryptocurrency Relevance 2017 U.S. sanctions begin targeting Venezuelan state debt and oil revenue. Traditional dollar financing becomes inaccessible. 2018 Venezuela launches the ‘Petro’ (PTR), a state-backed cryptocurrency. First major state attempt to create a sanctions-proof digital currency. 2020 U.S. Treasury explicitly bans U.S. persons from transacting in the Petro. Forces Venezuela to seek more discreet crypto options like Bitcoin. 2023 Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volumes in Bolivars spike on local exchanges. Indicates growing domestic crypto adoption for inflation hedging. 2024 Reports emerge of state-owned oil company PDVSA accepting BTC for exports. Direct evidence of state-level Bitcoin adoption for trade. 2025 Arrest of Maduro; U.S. announces investigation into Venezuelan overseas assets. Current investigation launches, focusing on informal crypto networks. This historical pattern demonstrates a clear trajectory toward cryptocurrency as a sanctions evasion mechanism. The use of Tether (USDT) is particularly strategic because its stable value mirrors the U.S. dollar without requiring access to U.S. bank accounts. Essentially, it provides dollar liquidity on a blockchain. A former Venezuelan finance ministry official, speaking anonymously due to safety concerns, stated, “The operational shift toward crypto was not ideological but purely survivalist. When your banks are blocked, you find another network.” The U.S. Investigation and Global Implications The United States Department of Justice and Treasury Department now lead a coordinated investigation. Their mandate extends beyond Venezuela’s secret Bitcoin stash to map its entire “informal financial network.” This network reportedly includes cryptocurrency exchanges in Turkey, Russia, and Asia, as well as gold and diamond traders. The investigative challenge is monumental, involving multiple jurisdictions and rapidly evolving technology. This case sets several critical precedents for international finance and law: Sovereign Crypto Seizure: Can a nation’s cryptocurrency holdings be legally seized like traditional foreign reserves? Exchange Liability: What responsibility do global crypto exchanges bear for servicing sanctioned states? Blockchain as Evidence: How will courts treat blockchain forensic analysis as evidence of state ownership? Sanctions Efficacy: Do cryptocurrencies fundamentally undermine the power of economic sanctions? Legal scholar Professor Michael Chen, who specializes in crypto regulation, highlights the complexity. “This isn’t just about finding the private keys,” Chen notes. “It’s about establishing a legal theory that digital assets held in decentralized wallets constitute recoverable state property. Furthermore, it tests whether the ‘travel rule’ and KYC regulations have any real bite against determined state actors.” The outcome could reshape how sanctions are designed and enforced in the digital age. Market and Miner Reactions The speculation has triggered noticeable reactions within cryptocurrency markets and mining communities. Initially, some traders feared the potential market impact of a forced $60 billion liquidation if assets were seized and sold. However, most analysts consider this scenario extremely unlikely due to the logistical and legal hurdles. More tangibly, the situation has renewed scrutiny on Bitcoin mining in Venezuela. For years, Venezuela hosted mining operations leveraging its heavily subsidized electricity. The government alternately embraced and cracked down on miners. If a state-controlled mining operation existed, it could provide a steady, off-the-books Bitcoin supply. Energy sector reports suggest specific industrial zones with protected power supplies could support large-scale mining. This possibility adds another layer to the investigation, turning physical infrastructure into a potential clue. Conclusion The mystery of Venezuela’s secret Bitcoin stash remains unresolved, suspended between unverified speculation and confirmed on-chain data. The core issue transcends the specific $60 billion figure, focusing instead on the demonstrated use of cryptocurrency by a nation-state to circumvent international isolation. The ongoing U.S. investigation will likely provide definitive answers, with profound implications for financial sovereignty, sanctions policy, and global cryptocurrency regulation. Regardless of the final tally, the case already proves that digital assets have become a serious tool in geopolitical conflict, moving far beyond their origins as a niche technological experiment. FAQs Q1: What is the evidence for Venezuela’s $60 billion Bitcoin stash? The evidence is currently circumstantial and based on financial intelligence reports. It includes analysis of transaction patterns, reports from defectors, and the country’s known motivation and technical capacity. Public blockchain records, however, show only minimal confirmed holdings. Q2: Why would Venezuela use Bitcoin instead of other assets? Bitcoin is borderless, censorship-resistant, and can be stored without reliance on any other country’s banking system. This makes it uniquely suited for a nation facing comprehensive international financial sanctions that freeze its traditional foreign reserves. Q3: How does Tether (USDT) fit into this situation? Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. It allows Venezuela to hold and transact in a dollar-equivalent digital asset without needing a U.S. bank account, providing stable value for trade settlements while evading banking channel blocks. Q4: Can the U.S. actually seize Venezuela’s cryptocurrency? Technically, it is possible if investigators can identify the custody solution (like a specific wallet or exchange account) and gain control of the private keys. Legally, it would require establishing that the assets are indeed state property subject to seizure under sanctions laws, a novel and untested area of international law. Q5: What impact has this speculation had on Bitcoin’s price? The direct market impact has been minimal. Most market participants view the $60 billion figure with skepticism, and the logistical barriers to a forced liquidation of such a hypothetical stash are considered too high to pose a credible threat to market stability.

Paul Griggs, PwC’s US senior partner, told the Financial Times the firm decided to “lean in” as Washington installed pro-crypto regulators and Congress advanced new rules for parts of the market that banks and blue-chip companies watch closely. The change lands as stablecoins move from a niche tool for crypto traders toward mainstream payment plumbing. Stablecoin Law And SEC Direction Pull Crypto Closer To Wall Street President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July 2025 , setting a federal framework for regulating payment stablecoins and opening the door for banks to issue their own tokens. “The Genius Act and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class,” Griggs said. “The tokenization of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem.” Regulation is also shifting at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chair Paul Atkins has said he wants clearer, more predictable rules for crypto markets, and Reuters reported the agency is working on new approaches for how tokens are issued, held and traded. PwC sits at the centre of that demand because it is one of the world’s largest professional services networks, best known for auditing public companies and advising executives on tax, deals, controls and risk. Regulatory Comfort Spurs Demand For Audits And Token Expertise As crypto products move into regulated finance, clients need auditors who can test reserves, governance and disclosure, and consultants who can map how tokenized cash and tokenized assets flow through real-world systems. Until recently, the Big Four kept higher hurdles for many crypto clients in the US, in part because regulators signalled skepticism and the sector carried reputational risk after repeated blowups. Watchdogs have also long flagged consumer protection concerns and the use of digital assets in fraud and money laundering. With the US policy mood turning friendlier, Griggs said PwC has been pitching crypto tech as a practical upgrade for payments, with stablecoins framed as a way to make transfers faster and cheaper in certain corridors. PwC Builds Crypto Bench Strength To Support New Clients PwC is also taking on audit work in the sector. Mara Holdings, a publicly traded bitcoin miner, appointed PwC as its auditor for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2025, according to a company filing. Griggs said PwC also had to build capability before taking on more work, including senior hires such as Cheryl Lesnik. “We are never going to lean into a business that we haven’t equipped ourselves to deliver,” he told the FT. “Over the last 10 to 12 months, as we’ve taken on more opportunities in that digital assets arena, we’ve bolstered our resource pool inside and outside.” The push is not happening in isolation. Deloitte has audited Coinbase since 2020, and KPMG has also been marketing digital asset compliance and risk services, as the Big Four position for a market where tokenization and regulated stablecoins pull traditional finance closer to crypto rails.

Lopp said the latest bump was even more surprising, given that mailing list traffic had slumped the previous year after the platform migrated from Linux Foundation servers to Google Groups. The number of contributors has also continued to grow, with 135 individuals contributing to Bitcoin Core in 2025 compared to approximately 112 the previous year. Loop says BTC Core developers modified about 285,000 lines in 2026 Despite the increase in activity , overall code changes remained steady, with about 285,000 lines modified during the year versus 276,000 the year before, Lopp reported. In November, Bitcoin Core also wrapped up its first publicly disclosed third-party security audit, led by Quarkslab and funded by Brink, which found no critical or high-severity flaws in the project’s peer-to-peer networking layer. Moreover, funding for Bitcoin Core development remains steady so far, with VanEck pledging 5% of the profits from its spot Bitcoin ETF to Brink. Meanwhile, in an October report, 1A1z found that Bitcoin Core had approximately 41 developers, excluding test engineers, researchers, and related protocols such as Lightning Network and Nostr, as well as the closely connected libsecp256k1 library. The report also compared Web3 developments for comparison. Polkadot , meanwhile, spent $7 million in 2023 on core development with a market cap of merely 1.2 percent of Bitcoin’s. It had boosted its spending to $16.8 million in 2024. Ethereum’s core developer costs: $32.3 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024, and Bitcoin: around $840 million. Crypto Fear and Greed Index is at a “neutral” 40 For the first time since October, CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Fear and Greed Index also reached a “neutral” reading on Sunday, signaling a potential easing of investor fear. At 40, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index suggests that investors are neither overly fearful nor bullish. Crypto market confidence declined heavily sometime in November, with the index hitting its lowest reading of 2025, at 10, indicating “extreme fear.” Similarly, in October, crypto investor confidence in the crypto market had sunk as a major market crash disrupted the bull run. Bitcoin’s value surged above $125,000 days leading up to the dip, eventually sliding to around $80,000. Many altcoins also sank overnight, erasing a significant portion of their value, and the total altcoin market cap (excluding BTC and ETH) plummeted by approximately 33% in just one day. Crypto sentiment has improved from late 2025’s “extreme fear,” but geopolitical risks and lack of retail activity may slow recovery. The market is still waiting to see how cryptocurrencies will be affected by the US strike on Venezuela. US President Trump announced on Saturday, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country.” Bitcoin did not exhibit the typical behavior of risk-on assets, which often decline during periods of acute and violent geopolitical or economic stress. While some analysts believe the attack is unlikely to impact the value of Bitcoin significantly, others warn that its true outcome may not become clear until U.S. markets open on Monday.

The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend injected fresh uncertainty into global markets, influencing moves across equities, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and currencies, while also prompting sharp political reactions from allies and further pointed remarks from President Donald Trump. Asian markets and oil react to Venezuela developments Asian equities advanced broadly on Monday, with investors weighing geopolitical risks against optimism ahead of a heavy slate of economic data. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.36%, while S&P 500 e-mini futures edged up 0.13%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 3%, nearing a record high reached two months ago, after data showed manufacturing activity stabilised in December following five months of contraction. South Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s benchmark index both climbed more than 2.7% to fresh record highs. Elsewhere, Australia’s benchmark index added 0.1%. China-linked markets lagged. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.01%, dragged lower by energy stocks after a gauge of Hong Kong-listed oil and gas companies fell 3.1%. Oil prices were choppy as markets assessed the impact of the US intervention in Venezuela and an OPEC+ decision to keep output unchanged. Brent crude futures fell 0.3% to $60.55 a barrel. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said the removal of Maduro was “unlikely to have meaningful near-term economic consequences for the global economy,” though he warned that “its political and geopolitical ramifications will reverberate.” Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research, said Venezuela would need significant capital and engineering support to restore output. “We are therefore not sellers of oil in this situation and, in fact, think that upside risks could develop,” he said. Bitcoin and safe havens gain on political uncertainty Bitcoin rose to a three-week high in early Asian trading as political uncertainty boosted demand for alternative and haven assets. The largest cryptocurrency climbed as much as 2.3% to $93,323, its highest level since Dec. 11, before easing back to around $91,453 later in the session. Ether was little changed at $3,141. The move came alongside gains in precious metals. Gold rose about 1.8% to $4,411.50 an ounce, after earlier jumping above $4,400, while silver surged as much as 3.92% as investors sought safety. Bitcoin’s recent gains follow weeks of range-bound trading and come despite the cryptocurrency ending last year down 6.5%. Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX, said the rally was being driven by crypto-native firms and a lack of selling by miners, family offices, and large funds. On Jan. 2, investors put $471 million into US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the largest daily inflow since Nov. 11. Denmark pushes back on Trump’s Greenland rhetoric Geopolitical tensions extended beyond Latin America. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned President Trump to stop threatening to acquire Greenland, just a day after the US operation in Venezuela. “The Kingdom of Denmark — and thus Greenland — is part of NATO and is therefore covered by the alliance’s security guarantee,” Frederiksen said, adding that she would “strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally.” Her remarks followed comments by Trump, quoted by The Atlantic, saying, “We do need Greenland, absolutely.” Trump has long floated the idea of acquiring the mineral-rich territory, an ambition that has been repeatedly rejected by both Greenland and Denmark. Trump targets Colombia and signals wider drug crackdown A day after Maduro’s capture, Trump signaled that other countries could face pressure over drug trafficking. Speaking aboard Air Force One, he singled out Colombia and its president, Gustavo Petro. “Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long,” Trump said. Trump said his campaign against Venezuela would also weaken Cuba, noting that Cuban soldiers assist Venezuela’s military. “Cuba looks like it is ready to fall,” he said, without offering evidence. He struck a slightly more conciliatory tone toward Mexico, while repeating complaints about drug flows and noting that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has rejected his offer of US military assistance.

CLSK trades at an 11.63x forward P/E (GAAP), a 63% discount to peers, highlighting significant undervaluation. The company's AI/HPC diversification is a long-term pivot, enhancing its strategic appeal beyond pure Bitcoin mining. With a $43,000 margin cost per Bitcoin, CLSK is well-positioned to weather potential crypto downturns. Since my previous coverage on CleanSpark ( CLSK ), the stock experienced a sharp downswing. Although weak AI sentiment clouds the AI/HPC pivot, in my opinion, the poor stock price action was mainly driven by Bitcoin volatility. Quite frankly, it does make sense, as 100% of its revenue comes from mining operations. Unless the company signs early contracts with pre-funding, it will take time for CleanSpark to expand its AI capabilities, so I don't expect revenue from the pivot any time soon. Now, has anything changed in the bigger picture? I don't think so. I am holding the stock, and I am not nervous despite a sharp correction. I believe that at the current price tag, it remains heavily discounted. CLSK trades at 11.63 forward P/E (GAAP) , a 63% discount versus peers at 31.23x. The diversification into AI/HPC is a long-term pivot that makes CleanSpark a more compelling play, and with a roughly $43,000 margin cost per Bitcoin , it seems to be well-positioned to withstand another crypto winter if needed. I reiterate a Strong Buy rating. Zero Convertible Enables AI and Mining Infrastructure Funding I love that management stands by its initial plan to not dilute shareholders through ATM offerings. Both mining and AI HPC operations are capital-intensive, and although debt-related funding remains through convertibles, that doesn't weigh on investors' shoulders in the meantime. CLSK closed approximately $1.15 billion convertible at 0% coupon to mature in 2032 as an alternative to raising cash through an ATM. What I also love about the recent announcement is that management stated that while funds will also be used for infrastructure opportunities, CleanSpark repurchased nearly 11% of the total outstanding common stock, reaching $460 million in returned value to shareholders. Quite honestly, that's the opposite of dilution, and to me it raises confidence in management's decisions. This may help EPS growth, too. CLSK: The Company Aim To Lead Energy And Infrastructure Compute (CleanSpark Investor Relations) The legacy miner's ambitions are costly. That's why I like the company's decision to use convertibles to scale, rather than dilute its current shareholders. Especially as there's a significant demand for funding at 0% coupon. It expects to revolutionize into an energy and infrastructure compute leader . I love this. The global AI data center market is anticipated to surge 26.8% CAGR over the next 6 years and reach $93.6 billion in market size by 2032. Now, that's already a significant market, about $18 billion, but it remains in its early stage. CleanSpark offers exposure to this high-growth market from its first innings while also maintaining focus on Bitcoin mining operations. Such peers as IREN ( IREN ) have decided to completely pivot to AI HPC . Now, while the market has rewarded IREN with a massive upside in the short term, logically, it has transferred dependency from Bitcoin volatility to the AI space that is also tied to multiple uncertainties. I am not a fan of this, and quite frankly, I am happy with CLSK's decision to diversify but not shift focus completely. What's next? CleanSpark chose Texas for its AI HPC expansion, acquiring a site and 285 MW power supply agreements . That's a significant step for scaling into the next-gen AI and cloud capabilities. Business transformation unlocks new opportunities for CLSK to tap into a high-growth market. To me, that's an appealing shift. What I also think the market discounts is the company's know-how on how to maintain high-performance computing and sustain the uptick. I believe it will leverage knowledge and experience from mining operations to AI HPC pivot, making it a compelling service provider. Moderately Leveraged Balance Sheet, but Fundamentals Remain Intact Yes, the AI HPC pioneer has a moderately leveraged capital structure that I don't love, but quite frankly, it doesn't make me too concerned. CLSK: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) CleanSpark has about $826 million in total obligations . It also has nearly $43 million in cash, but that barely offsets the leverage. Now, why doesn't it make me too concerned? If we have a look at the interest expenses over the past 12 months, CLSK paid $11.3 million to service its debt . That's insignificant. It accounts for about a 1.3% annual interest rate versus total obligations, and quite frankly, that's below the current inflation. On top of that, CLSK benefited from high-yield accounts and generated $4.1 million in interest and investment income, offsetting the interest expense over the past year. So, it actually experienced $7.1 million in net interest expense, or less than 1% versus total obligations. I'd also want to flag that while a dovish Fed could boost sentiment for risk assets, CLSK doesn't really need interest rates to drop significantly. The current debt is tied to low interest rates, which leaves financial flexibility for management. CLSK: FY2025 Performance (CleanSpark Investor Relations) I think we all could agree that FY2025 was a breakthrough performance year for CleanSpark, supported by favorable Bitcoin price action. Now, it has achieved $766 million in FY2025 revenue , which represents a 102% increase on a year-over-year basis. For the bottom line, it was a turnaround year too, posting nearly $365 million in net income, a substantial difference from $146 million in net loss last year. CleanSpark reached 50 EH/s for mining operations and managed to mine 7,873 coins over the FY2025. What I mostly love about the performance is it managed to maintain low-cost operations while significantly increasing EH/s. As I stated previously in the article, the marginal cost per Bitcoin was roughly $43,000. That's nearly 107% above the current BTCUSD price of roughly $89,000 . This supports my bullish stance, as Bitcoin could drop further, and CleanSpark would still mine profitably. Sure, we could argue that the outlook would deteriorate if BTCUSD dropped significantly. I'd like to emphasize a few things here. Firstly, if we assume Bitcoin dropped to the 200-week moving average of nearly $57,000 , which would technically mean a crypto winter, CLSK should be able to mine at approximately 33% profit versus the marginal cost. This indicates fundamental strength, low-cost power contracts, and significant execution, making it a compelling play. Secondly, sure, it would also take a hit on its Bitcoin holdings. It held 13,054 BTC at the end of November, but even if the BTC were to drop to $57,000, that's roughly $744 million in liquid assets at that price tag. CLSK would be able to cover its obligations to a large extent. Lastly, CLSK produced 587 coins in November alone, and while it reflected a 4% drop in BTC produced, the HODL holdings increased by 21 coins. In my opinion, that's due to network difficulty, because hashrate actually increased from 46.6 EH/s to 47.4 EH/s, indicating great execution, but natural fluctuation due to business origin. Quite frankly, in addition to the last argument, the fact that it has increased Bitcoin holdings while production was down on a month-over-month basis implies that management has the financial capabilities to achieve expansion goals without an urgent need for additional funding. That's why I think that fundamentals remain intact and the bigger picture is bullish. Undervalued Versus Peers CleanSpark trades at a compelling valuation. Versus the fiscal FY2026 estimate at 13x , while the 24-month earnings multiple reaches about 10x. CLSK: Trading At Compelling Valuation (Seeking Alpha) For instance, IREN trades at roughly 40x earnings multiple versus fiscal FY2026, while Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) trades at 48x . That's at least 3x undervaluation versus peers that have pivoted to AI HPC. We could also compare it to a more traditional Bitcoin miner, MARA Holdings ( MARA ). Now, in terms of the earnings multiple, MARA trades at 232x , which creates a massive gap versus CLSK's valuation. If we compare all these companies in terms of their book value, we can see that both CleanSpark and MARA trade at suppressed valuations. Surely enough, IREN and CIFR have AI HPC contracted revenue supporting their pivot to a high-growth market, resulting in a higher multiple. But if tailwinds materialize tied to global market growth, CLSK should be able to benefit from the bullish trend and rebound from the current level. CLSK: Price/Book Value Versus Peers (YCharts) Why does this matter? It tells me that the market hasn't really priced in its AI HPC pivot. Quite honestly, I like it a lot, especially as CLSK is pursuing strategic investments like the one in greater Houston tied to AI and cloud capabilities. In my opinion, the market is likely to reprice CLSK at a higher premium sooner rather than later. To this, on a forward Price/Book value ratio of 3.54 , CLSK trades at more than a 21% discount versus the sector median of 4.51, which argues for my bullish thesis. CleanSpark is also a profitable company, and I love that it operates at above-market margins. The gross profit margin (TTM) of 55% highlights a 13% outperformance versus peers at 49%. The net income margin (TTM) of 48% signals a nearly 10x advantage versus peers at 5%. Surely enough, we need to account for Bitcoin volatility, and unless BTCUSD rebounds from here, CLSK is likely to experience a contraction on the bottom line. However, the stock is down 22% over the past month , and it tells me that it could already be priced in. Risks and Concerns The crypto community is concerned that the digital assets could enter a prolonged bear market. Could that happen? Sure. Investors anticipated an end-year rally, but that didn't happen, and now one can only guess what is likely to happen next. As I have flagged, there's a possibility of BTCUSD approaching its 200-week moving average at nearly $57,000. Although this would imply a 56% drop from the current levels, based on my analysis, CLSK should still mine profitably. But we all could agree that such a poor sentiment would dramatically weigh on CLSK's stock price. To the last point, this also shows why I think this AI HPC pivot was a great strategic decision. Nevertheless, it comes with an execution risk. If CLSK struggles to gain market position in the AI HPC space and doesn't sign multi-year agreements with hyperscalers, sentiment may be clouded. Also, if there are concerns tied to scaling the business and infrastructure, investors may favor alternatives in the market. This AI HPC pivot also depends on AI sentiment. If heavy Capex investments don't translate to meaningful top- and bottom-line growth, hyperscalers may cut spending, which could cloud a bullish narrative, and likely struggle to keep up with estimated growth projections for this high-growth market. CleanSpark is a Strong Buy CLSK is a high-volatility stock, and price action could be brutal. 52-week trading range shows a 4x difference in price, and trust me, it could be a difficult stock to stomach for long-term holders who favor a stable investment environment. But I think the upside and risk ratio here is compelling. Based on my analysis, it remains undervalued versus peers, and because of the low cost to mine BTC, it appears well-positioned to withstand a crypto winter if one occurs. There's a big gap between earnings multiple versus AI HPC peers, and in terms of Price/Book value, the market seems to be discounting the stock. If CleanSpark continues to execute well, I think it may rebound from these levels, and the market could reprice sooner rather than later. I sustain my Strong Buy rating. 23 Wall Street analysts forecast a $23.27 12-month price target, indicating a 101% upside. Time will tell, but I agree with analysts.",CLSK|BTC-USD|MARA,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

María Corina Machado, a prominent advocate of Bitcoin, is a key figure in this shift. The Venezuelan opposition leader and winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize is a second-favorite to lead Venezuela away from Maduro’s authoritarian rule . Maduro has been moved to New York to face federal charges for narcotics trafficking and corruption. According to predictions by Kalshi, a market platform, Machado is expected to garner 28% of Venezuela’s vote by the end of 2026. She’s somewhat behind Edmundo González Urrutia of the Unitary Platform, who has a 32 percent chance. González Urrutia is widely believed to have won the country’s May 2025 election but was barred from taking office by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, led by Maduro. Third is Vice President Delcy Eloína Rodríguez, a former running mate of Maduro, who has a 27% chance. After Maduro was captured, the Supreme Court named Rodríguez acting president. US President Donald Trump said the US would oversee Venezuela until a new power is in place, raising a question mark over the country’s near-term future. If María Corina Machado leads, Venezuela could eventually enjoy fundamental human rights and political freedoms. The nation could also step up free-market reform by using Bitcoin (BTC $93,210) as an alternative to the Venezuelan bolívar, which has lost over 99.99% of its value since Maduro took office in 2013. Machado drives crypto adoption in Venezuela *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""7e7d0235-43c1-48dc-8e5e-0b9fd5af8f5f"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> María Corina Machado is well-acquainted with Bitcoin, having long seen it as more than just a currency — but as a means of survival, self-determination, and empowerment. In a 2024 conversation with Human Rights Foundation strategist Alex Gladstein, she outlined proposals to adopt Bitcoin as a national reserve asset and promote its use in everyday transactions. During Venezuela’s hyperinflation, the widespread adoption of Bitcoin was largely driven by its use by many people to protect their savings and make ends meet, enabling them to support their families. What started as a humanitarian solution has evolved into a crucial instrument of economic resilience — one that a future democratic Venezuela would seamlessly integrate into its financial system. With more than 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country since 2013, cryptocurrency has become vital for remitting money back home, as well as managing one’s own finances effectively. The Machado-led revolutionary government could institutionalize this stage of adopting new technology by creating an environment in which cryptocurrencies are used as currency in some markets (financial assets), supported for both local and international uses. Her rise marks a historic moment for the global crypto community: the potential for a great nation to adopt digital assets at a state level, legitimize them, and encourage others to do the same. Machado’s presidency could turn Venezuela into a model for crypto-powered economic resiliency and innovation. Trump questions Machado’s ability to lead Venezuela US President Donald Trump, however, doubts whether María Corina Machado can steer Venezuela out of Maduro’s rule. While Machado briefly surpassed Edmundo González Urrutia in Kalshi forecasts, Trump stated that she did not have the support or respect necessary to govern effectively. Yet analysts contend she already enjoys robust support from Venezuelans within the country as well as outside. Key to Trump’s challenge is Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, who is now also the leader of Venezuela’s United Socialist Party; the party run by President Maduro. Rodriguez initially said she would try to work with the U.S., then changed tack, describing Maduro’s arrest as all wrong and warning that there would be terrible consequences for a wrong move.

56838298,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258399,1767593411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance BTC Deposits Surge: A $2.4B Warning Sign as Buying Power Stalls,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-btc-eth-deposits-warning/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Binance BTC Deposits Surge: A $2.4B Warning Sign as Buying Power Stalls In a significant development for global cryptocurrency markets, the Binance exchange has recorded a staggering $2.4 billion influx of Bitcoin and Ethereum over just seven days, a movement that analysts interpret as a potential precursor to increased selling pressure. This substantial deposit wave, however, faces a critical imbalance as corresponding buying power, measured through stablecoin inflows, remains conspicuously weak, creating a complex puzzle for traders and long-term investors alike. The situation underscores a pivotal moment where on-chain data provides crucial signals about whale behavior and broader market sentiment. Decoding the $2.4B Binance BTC and ETH Inflow Data from the analytics platform CryptoQuant, highlighted in a report by Cointelegraph, reveals the precise composition of this massive movement. Analyst CryptoOnchain detailed that the inflows consisted of approximately $1.33 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and $1.07 billion in Ethereum (ETH) . To provide context, this volume represents one of the largest concentrated deposits into a single exchange in recent months. Typically, such significant transfers from private wallets to an exchange custodial address suggest holders are preparing to sell, as exchanges facilitate the easiest liquidity conversion. Consequently, this action often precedes or coincides with downward price pressure, especially if demand does not match the potential supply. For comparison, here is a breakdown of the weekly inflows: Asset Approximate Value Implied Market Signal Bitcoin (BTC) $1.33 Billion High Potential Selling Pressure Ethereum (ETH) $1.07 Billion High Potential Selling Pressure Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, etc.) $42 Million Low New Buying Power The stark contrast between the $2.4 billion in potential sell-side assets and the mere $42 million in new stablecoin buying power forms the core of the current market concern. Stablecoins act as the primary fuel for cryptocurrency purchases; their inflow directly represents fresh capital ready to buy BTC, ETH, and other digital assets. This multi-billion-dollar divergence suggests the market may struggle to absorb the deposited coins without a price correction, unless other sources of demand emerge unexpectedly. The Critical Lag in Cryptocurrency Buying Power The meager $42 million in stablecoin deposits presents a particularly telling data point. Historically, robust bull markets are characterized by heavy stablecoin inflows into exchanges, as traders position themselves to purchase assets. The current lack thereof indicates several potential scenarios: Capital Rotation: Existing capital within the crypto ecosystem is being reshuffled, not expanded. Market Caution: Traders are waiting on the sidelines for clearer price direction or macroeconomic cues. External Drain: Capital may be flowing out of the crypto space into traditional assets or being held in off-exchange yield products. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain’s analysis points to another worrying trend: a decrease in the volume of Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges. This metric is often viewed as a proxy for long-term holding conviction, particularly among large investors or “whales.” When whales withdraw coins to cold storage, it signals a belief in future price appreciation and reduces immediate sell-side liquidity. A decline in this activity, therefore, suggests a potential weakening of long-term bullish sentiment among some of the market’s most influential participants. Expert Analysis on Whale Behavior and Price Impact The combination of rising exchange deposits and faltering whale accumulation creates a challenging environment for prices. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and IntoTheBlock have consistently noted that sustained price rallies require a foundation of strong holder conviction and continuous demand. The current on-chain data, as reported, presents a headwind to such a scenario. For instance, if the $2.4 billion in deposited assets were sold onto the market with only $42 million of dedicated new buy-side capital, order books would be overwhelmed, likely triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders and further declines. This dynamic does not occur in a vacuum. It interacts with broader financial conditions, including interest rate expectations, traditional equity market performance, and geopolitical stability. Market participants must consider whether this is an isolated liquidity event or part of a larger trend of profit-taking following recent price gains. The timing is also crucial, as it provides a real-time case study in how on-chain analytics have become an indispensable tool for gauging market structure beyond mere price charts. Historical Context and Market Structure Implications Similar patterns of large exchange inflows preceding price corrections have been observed in previous market cycles. For example, periods in early 2022 and mid-2023 saw analogous spikes in exchange balances that correlated with subsequent price drops. The current event’s scale, however, makes it particularly notable for the 2025 market landscape. The data underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency markets, where millions of individual data points are aggregated to reveal the strategic movements of large holders. The structure of modern crypto markets also plays a role. With the proliferation of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, investors now have alternatives to centralized exchanges for lending, borrowing, and earning yield. While the data cited focuses on Binance, a cross-exchange analysis would provide a fuller picture. Nevertheless, Binance’s position as a global liquidity hub makes its flows a critical bellwether. The event highlights the importance of monitoring multiple data streams: Exchange Net Flow: (Deposits – Withdrawals) Stablecoin Supply Ratio: Measuring stablecoin market cap against BTC’s. Entity-Adjusted Dormancy: Gauging the spending behavior of long-held coins. Conclusion The $2.4 billion deposit of BTC and ETH into Binance serves as a powerful warning signal for the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing a growing divergence between potential supply and available demand. The critical lag in buying power, evidenced by minimal stablecoin inflows, combined with a noted decrease in long-term whale accumulation, creates a challenging technical backdrop for any immediate price rally. While on-chain data does not dictate future prices absolutely, it provides a transparent window into the balance of power between buyers and sellers. Market participants would be prudent to monitor whether this imbalance corrects through an influx of new capital or resolves through price discovery, marking another chapter in the volatile evolution of digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when large amounts of BTC are deposited to an exchange like Binance? Typically, it signals that the holders of those assets intend to sell them in the near future, as exchanges are the primary venues for converting crypto to fiat or stablecoins. It increases the immediate available supply on the market. Q2: Why is the $42 million stablecoin inflow considered low? Stablecoins represent ready-to-use buying power. In a healthy, ascending market, large crypto deposits are often met with similarly large stablecoin inflows from investors looking to buy. A ratio of $2.4B to $42M indicates a severe shortage of new capital poised to purchase the deposited assets. Q3: How does whale withdrawal behavior affect cryptocurrency prices? When large investors (whales) withdraw coins from exchanges to private custody, it reduces the immediate sell-side supply and signals long-term holding confidence. A decrease in this activity can suggest these key players are less committed to accumulating or are preparing to realize profits. Q4: Can prices still go up despite these bearish on-chain signals? Yes. On-chain data is one of several factors influencing price. Positive macroeconomic news, a major institutional adoption announcement, or a sudden surge in retail demand could override these technical signals. However, the data presents a significant headwind. Q5: Where does this data about Binance deposits come from? The data is sourced from blockchain analytics firms like CryptoQuant, which track the flow of assets to and from known exchange wallet addresses. These firms aggregate this public blockchain data to provide insights into market sentiment and liquidity conditions.

Key Takeaways: Crypto whales moved about $2.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ether onto Binance, marking the exchange’s largest net inflow in a month. Stablecoin flows remained flat, signaling weak buying power despite the surge in whale deposits. Slowing accumulation and reduced withdrawals suggest growing selling pressure and fading long-term holding. According to on-chain data cited by CryptoOnchain, so-called whales deposited roughly $2.4 billion to Binance, split almost evenly between Bitcoin and Ether. The inflows mark the exchange’s largest net deposit total in about a month, with $1.33 billion in Bitcoin and $1.07 billion in Ether added over the period. Whale Inflows Rise as Stablecoin Buying Power Stalls However, analysts noted a key imbalance. “Crucially, this surge in risk-asset deposits was not accompanied by new buying power,” CryptoOnchain said, pointing to stablecoin net flows that were largely flat at around $42 million for the week. Most of those movements reflected transfers between the Ethereum and Tron blockchains rather than fresh capital entering the market. Large transfers from private wallets to exchanges are typically interpreted as either positioning for spot selling or the use of assets as collateral in derivatives markets. In this case, the absence of strong stablecoin inflows suggests limited capacity for sustained buying pressure. Additional metrics point to a broader slowdown in accumulation. CryptoOnchain said Bitcoin accumulation has stalled since October, while the average size of deposits to Binance has risen sharply. Bitcoin Inflows to Binance are Increasingly Whale-Sized “A 34x increase in the average size of each deposit. This metric reflects the average BTC per inflow transaction, signaling that larger holders are now more active on Binance.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/SkpgMUG8vP — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 4, 2026 Average transaction sizes flowing onto the exchange jumped from roughly eight to 10 BTC earlier in the year to between 22 and 26 BTC recently, indicating that large holders are moving “substantial amounts” of Bitcoin onto the platform. At the same time, outflows from Binance have weakened. The average size of withdrawal transactions has dropped into what analysts described as a “suppressed range,” with exchange outflow means fluctuating between 5.5 and 8.3 BTC. That trend suggests fewer coins are being pulled into cold storage, a behavior often linked to long-term holding. “In other words, large-scale accumulation and the movement of Bitcoin into cold storage by major holders have drastically decreased,” CryptoOnchain said. The firm described the combination of rising inflows, muted outflows, and flat stablecoin demand as a warning sign that selling pressure could build. Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions. Barhydt said the US central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt.

Well, this marks a decisive shift in the bank’s stance, from offering crypto exposure only upon client request to actively promoting it through financial advisors. For years, major banks sidelined cryptocurrencies over volatility and regulatory risks, with BofA restricting access to client-requested exposure only. Its shift to advisor-recommended allocations now marks a clear institutional endorsement, positioning digital assets as a legitimate portfolio allocation rather than a speculative outlier. Notably, the 4% allocation guidance strikes a balanced approach that while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain volatile, growing research shows that limited exposure can improve risk-adjusted returns. By keeping allocations modest, Bank of America enables clients to capture crypto’s upside while managing downside risk. Why does this matter? Well, this shift reflects strong, sustained client demand. Institutional and high-net-worth investors are no longer debating whether crypto belongs in portfolios, but how to allocate responsibly. Bitcoin, often called “digital gold,” is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation, currency debasement, and long-term macroeconomic uncertainty, themes that strongly resonate in today’s volatile global financial landscape. Beyond client demand, growing regulatory clarity has been a decisive factor in Bank of America’s shift. The rollout of regulated crypto products, most notably spot Bitcoin ETFs, alongside stronger institutional custody solutions has significantly reduced the operational and compliance risks that once sidelined traditional banks. These advances now allow advisors to recommend crypto exposure confidently within established regulatory frameworks. Bank of America’s endorsement could carry wide-reaching consequences across the financial industry. As a bellwether institution, its strategic moves often set the tone for peers. This pivot may accelerate a broader transition among major banks and wealth managers, from offering crypto only on request to actively integrating digital assets into mainstream portfolio strategies. Ultimately, Bank of America’s shift from client-requested only to advisor-recommended marks more than a policy change, it signals a fundamental rethinking of crypto within traditional finance. As Bitcoin and digital assets mature, their inclusion in mainstream portfolios is no longer a passing trend but a defining evolution in modern investing. Conclusion Bank of America’s move to recommend up to a 4% allocation to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies marks a pivotal shift in traditional finance. What was once a speculative, client-initiated exposure has evolved into an advisor-endorsed strategy, signaling crypto’s rising legitimacy as a portfolio diversifier. Driven by strong client demand, clearer regulation, and Bitcoin’s perceived role as a macro hedge, the decision sends a clear message: digital assets are no longer fringe investments, but an emerging fixture in mainstream portfolio construction.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Inflows and activity point to the engagement of large-scale traders, rather than retail investors. Whale activity and influence on exchanges have increased to a 10-month peak. Overall, the whale activity trend has emerged in place of retail interest. The expansion of whale influence peaked close to a 10-month high, just as the crypto market started a tentative recovery in the new year. For all exchanges, the BTC exchange whale ratio climbed to 0.504, a level not seen since March 2025. The ratio means whales are potentially putting selling pressure on BTC, and increasing the supply of available reserves. The whale metric takes into account the top 10 inflows relative to total exchange deposits. In January, the metric had a sharp increase, signaling the entrance of large market players. Historically, moves such as those have emerged as a source of selling pressure. The inflows coincided with a recovery for BTC above $92,000. The coin movement is happening on all exchanges and is not an isolated event. Binance consolidated whale traffic Binance remained the center of crypto inflows, now holding over 71% of stablecoin deposits. The exchange also draws in BTC deposits, with native BTC remaining one of the most active assets. Inflows to Binance are becoming larger on average, signaling a shift to large-scale players in the past two years. | Source: CryptoQuant . The exchange is also showing a trend of growing mean inflows, signaling the general prevalence of larger players. Binance is now the target of large-scale whale deposits. The inflows accelerated after the launch of multiple ETFs, signaling the exchange may be one of the trading venues for the funds. Whale activity may also signal an attempt to use the exchange’s liquidity and take profits during the short-term rallies. While Binance has been a retail venue, now the main centralized exchange has transformed into a hub for large players. Retail has moved to other platforms in Binance’s ecosystem, especially in-wallet activity and decentralized trading. Does whale activity signal BTC risk? Increased BTC whale activity may be a cautionary flag, especially as BTC returned to bullish momentum. Whales have taken profits near local market tops, and may be preparing to sell if BTC breaks out higher. The presence of whales may create price resistance for the leading coin. Other metrics may indicate better readiness for a rally, as BTC is also showing signs of reaching a local low. The current exchange whale ratio increase recalls previous selling periods, including the summer of 2025. Whales also moved in right after the October liquidation event, aiming to take profits before BTC had a more significant slide. Conditions may quickly shift on the BTC market, as there are also signs that whales are buying more coins through Binance. BTC is still showing signs of being in a bear market after a 30% cycle drawdown, but accumulation continues into new wallets, treasuries, and ETF inflows. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Analysts are now looking for further potential gains and the possibility of a return to six-figure Bitcoin prices. Michael Nadeau from The DeFi Report drew comparisons between the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, when BTC climbed 22% in the weeks that followed. “In the current environment, I’ve been anticipating a move for BTC back up to the 50-week moving average around $101,700,” he said . “Now we have a catalyst. The key question is whether that level can hold if it is, in fact, revisited.” A Bear Market Bounce What the analyst didn’t mention was the fact that 2022 was a bear market year that saw BTC decline 77% from its all-time high. A similar bear market scenario in 2026 could see the asset slump to $30,000. Trader Aaron Dishner echoed the sentiment, stating that crypto markets would bounce in early January as many traders likely closed positions before the end of 2025 for tax purposes, and would buy back aggressively at the start of 2026. “But my target for BTC is still $100k before the next leg down, and I imagine a LOT of you are wondering WHY!? Well, this happens at the start of every past bear market – in 2022, 2018, and 2015. This time is no different to me.” Bitcoin entrepreneur Joe Consorti was also convinced of a return to six figures first. BTC broke back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since October, testing levels not seen since early December, he said. “Sell pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Need to reclaim and hold the 50-week MA at $101k.” BTC is waking up in the new year, already up 6.24%. Broke back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since October.

The asset is now moving towards the upper band of a six-week sideways channel and needs to clear resistance above $94,000 to break out of it. “There is strength beneath this overall bottoming move higher,” said analyst ‘Sykodelic’ who added, “We had the double buy signal on the relative strength two days ago.” The post Could More Geopolitical Tension Drive BTC Back to Six Figures? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56843968,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=872179,1767603628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56843968.jpeg,Memecoin Strength Returns After Historic Market Decline: A Setup For A Comeback?,https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/memecoin-strength-returns-after-historic-market-decline-a-setup-for-a-comeback/,newsbtc,"The memecoin market went through a brutal reset in 2025, marking one of its sharpest downturns since the sector became a dominant force within crypto speculation. Following the euphoric memecoin mania that peaked and ultimately collapsed in November 2024, selling pressure steadily took control. Liquidity dried up, momentum faded, and most memecoins entered prolonged drawdowns that significantly underperformed the broader market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K As risk appetite weakened, memecoin dominance within the altcoin market continued to erode throughout the year. By December 2025, this dominance fell to a historical low, reflecting widespread capitulation among retail participants and a clear shift away from high-beta speculative assets. Many traders exited positions entirely, reinforcing the narrative that the memecoin cycle had fully played out. However, extreme pessimism often marks important turning points. According to an analysis by Darkfost from CryptoQuant, the current compression in memecoin dominance closely mirrors prior structural lows observed in past cycles. Notably, the last time memecoin dominance reached comparable levels, it occurred shortly before a powerful resurgence in the sector, driven by renewed liquidity, fresh narratives, and aggressive speculative flows. Memecoin Dominance Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Recent on-chain analysis highlights how far the memecoin sector has fallen relative to the broader altcoin market—and why some investors are starting to pay attention again. According to Darkfost’s framework, the key ratio compares the combined market capitalization of major memecoins against that of leading altcoins. At the height of the speculative frenzy in November 2024, this ratio climbed to roughly 0.11, meaning memecoins represented about 11% of total altcoin market value. That level reflected peak enthusiasm, heavy retail participation, and aggressive risk-taking. By December 2025, however, the same ratio had collapsed to around 0.032. In practical terms, memecoins had lost nearly two-thirds of their relative weight within the altcoin universe. This sharp contraction aligns with prolonged underperformance, capital rotation into larger assets, and widespread capitulation after months of declining prices. Importantly, recent price action suggests the bleeding may be slowing. Over the past several days, some of the largest memecoins have posted notable rebounds, hinting at renewed speculative interest. While this move is far too early to confirm a full trend reversal, it does suggest that selling pressure is no longer one-sided. For now, the data points to a tentative stabilization phase rather than a confirmed memecoin season. Still, for high-risk investors, such deeply compressed relative valuations have historically preceded sharp, sentiment-driven rallies—provided risk is managed carefully and expectations remain realistic. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Setup Advances: CEX Volume Hits Cycle Highs Despite Price Weakness Technical Rebound After A Prolonged Downtrend The memecoin market cap chart shows a clear shift in structure after months of sustained weakness. Throughout the second half of 2025, total memecoin capitalization trended decisively lower, forming a sequence of lower highs and lower lows while remaining capped below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. However, recent price action suggests the first meaningful attempt at stabilization. The market cap has rebounded sharply from the December lows near the $35–38 billion zone and is now trading back above the short-term moving average, reclaiming the $46 billion area. This move is accompanied by a noticeable pickup in volume, indicating renewed participation rather than a purely technical bounce on thin liquidity. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Despite this improvement, the broader trend remains cautious. The memecoin market cap is still trading below the longer-term moving averages, which continue to slope downward and act as overhead resistance around the $50–55 billion range. This suggests that while downside momentum has slowed, the market has not yet transitioned into a confirmed uptrend. In practical terms, the chart points to a relief rally within a broader bearish structure. For memecoins to regain sustained momentum, the market would need to consolidate above current levels and reclaim higher moving averages. Signaling that speculative capital is returning with conviction rather than opportunism.

This significant capital movement halts a two-week period of net outflows, signaling renewed institutional confidence as the 2025 cryptocurrency investment landscape undergoes a notable shift. The data reveals a compelling story of changing investor preferences, with Ethereum products experiencing explosive growth while Bitcoin maintains its foundational role. Digital Asset Funds Rebound with $582 Million Inflow CoinShares, a leading digital asset investment firm, published its weekly analysis on Monday. The report provides a critical snapshot of institutional sentiment. The $582 million net inflow for the week ending March 9, 2025, marks a decisive pivot. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing the underlying catalysts for this resurgence. The inflow primarily targeted exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed in major financial hubs. These products offer traditional investors regulated exposure to cryptocurrency prices without direct ownership. This weekly rebound occurs within a broader annual context of robust activity. For the full year of 2025 to date, these investment vehicles have attracted a total of $47.2 billion in net inflows. This figure remains remarkably close to the $48.7 billion recorded for the entirety of 2024. The sustained volume demonstrates the maturing integration of digital assets into global portfolios. However, a dramatic redistribution of capital beneath this stable top-line number tells a more nuanced story. The 2025 Allocation Shift: Ethereum’s Meteoric Rise The most striking development within the 2025 data is the dramatic reallocation between major assets. Inflows into Bitcoin-specific products, while still substantial, have fallen by 35% year-over-year to $26.9 billion. Conversely, Ethereum products witnessed a staggering 138% surge in inflows, reaching $12.7 billion. This divergence highlights a maturing market where investors are diversifying beyond the flagship asset. The surge in Ethereum interest likely correlates with several key developments: Network Upgrades: Successful implementations of scalability and efficiency improvements on the Ethereum network. DeFi and NFT Maturation: The sustained growth of decentralized finance and non-fungible token ecosystems built primarily on Ethereum. Staking Yield Appeal: The ability for certain ETP structures to offer exposure to staking rewards, providing a yield component absent from pure Bitcoin products. Other altcoins also posted impressive figures. XRP and Solana investment products attracted $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion in net inflows, respectively. This strong performance indicates investor appetite for selective altcoin exposure. However, the category of “other altcoins” collectively saw a 30% decrease in inflows compared to the previous year. This suggests a consolidation effect, where capital is concentrating into a handful of leading projects with clearer use cases and liquidity. Analyzing the Broader Crypto Investment Landscape The weekly inflow data cannot be viewed in isolation. It interacts with macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and on-chain activity. For instance, the reversal of outflows often coincides with periods of price stability or bullish technical indicators for major cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, announcements regarding regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions like the United States or the European Union frequently precipitate institutional capital movements. The CoinShares report serves as a reliable lagging indicator of decisions made by fund managers and accredited investors. The consistency of near-$50 billion annual inflows across 2024 and 2025 is itself a powerful signal. It underscores that digital asset exposure is transitioning from a speculative bet to a strategic allocation for a growing segment of the investment community. This trend persists despite periodic volatility, suggesting a long-term horizon for many participants. The structure of these flows—overwhelmingly into regulated, exchange-listed products—emphasizes the demand for secure and familiar investment wrappers. 2024 vs. 2025 Digital Asset Fund Inflow Comparison (Year-to-Date) Asset 2024 Inflows 2025 Inflows Year-over-Year Change Bitcoin $41.4B (est.) $26.9B -35% Ethereum $5.3B (est.) $12.7B +138% XRP N/A $3.7B N/A Solana N/A $3.6B N/A Total Market $48.7B $47.2B -3% Expert Perspective on Institutional Behavior Market analysts interpret these flows as evidence of portfolio diversification within the digital asset class. “The 2025 data clearly shows investors are no longer treating ‘crypto’ as a monolith,” explains a veteran financial analyst specializing in emerging assets. “They are making distinct allocations based on technology, use case, and risk profile. The massive growth in Ethereum inflows reflects a bet on its ecosystem utility, while the sustained Bitcoin inflows represent a continued store-of-value thesis.” This behavioral shift mirrors earlier patterns in traditional markets, where investors first adopt a broad asset class before strategically weighting its components. The impact of these fund flows extends beyond the products themselves. Sustained inflows provide underlying buy-side pressure in spot markets, as issuers must purchase the corresponding assets to back their ETP shares. This mechanism creates a direct conduit from traditional finance into the crypto economy. Therefore, weekly reports like those from CoinShares are closely monitored for early signs of changing supply and demand dynamics that could influence broader market prices. Conclusion The $582 million weekly net inflow into digital asset funds represents a significant resurgence of institutional interest, breaking a short streak of outflows. More importantly, the full-year 2025 data paints a picture of a maturing market where total capital remains steady but its distribution is evolving rapidly. Ethereum has emerged as a formidable destination for investment, seeing a 138% surge in inflows, while Bitcoin continues to anchor the market with substantial, if slightly diminished, flows. The strong performances of XRP and Solana, contrasted with a decline for other altcoins, indicate a flight to quality and liquidity. Ultimately, these digital asset fund flow trends confirm the asset class’s ongoing integration into the global financial system, marked by strategic diversification and a focus on fundamental value drivers. FAQs Q1: What does a “net inflow” mean for digital asset funds? A1: A net inflow means more new capital was invested into these funds and products than was withdrawn during the measured period. It indicates positive investor sentiment and buying pressure for the underlying assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q2: Why did Ethereum fund inflows surge by 138% in 2025? A2: The surge is attributed to growing investor confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), successful network upgrades improving scalability, and the yield potential from staking mechanisms offered by some investment products. Q3: Are digital asset fund inflows the same as direct cryptocurrency purchases? A3: Not exactly. These inflows represent investments into regulated financial products (like ETFs or ETPs) that track the price of cryptocurrencies. The fund issuer then typically buys the underlying asset, so it indirectly creates buying pressure in the spot market. Q4: What is the significance of the $47.2 billion total inflow for 2025? A4: The figure, which is similar to 2024’s total, demonstrates sustained institutional demand. It suggests that allocating to digital assets is becoming a consistent strategy for many investors, not just a reaction to short-term price spikes. Q5: How reliable is CoinShares as a source for this data? A5: CoinShares is a established and publicly-listed digital asset investment and trading firm. Their weekly fund flows report is widely cited by major financial news outlets and is considered a authoritative source for tracking institutional movement in the crypto ETP/ETF space.

The research, titled “ Common Bitcoin Energy Misconceptions ,” dismantles several widely circulated claims about Bitcoin mining’s resource consumption and environmental footprint. Batten presents evidence from peer-reviewed studies and real-world grid data that contradicts narratives suggesting the technology burdens power systems and drives up consumer costs. https://t.co/HQ93NP9I92 — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) January 3, 2026 Grid Stabilization Through Flexible Demand Multiple independent studies confirm Bitcoin mining’s capacity to balance electrical grids due to its interruptible nature, particularly on networks transitioning toward higher concentrations of variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind. A whitepaper referenced by Batten from Duke University energy experts concluded that Controllable Load Resources, including Bitcoin mining operations , help stabilize grids and defer the costs of expensive infrastructure upgrades. He also referenced research from ERCOT, the Texas grid that hosts the largest concentration of Bitcoin mining globally, which shows predominantly stabilizing effects from near-daily Frequency Regulation and Demand Response services. Former ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones summarized the findings: “ [Bitcoin mining operations] have found a way to come into the market and take some of that excess wind in offpeak periods. Then it can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers… And if a generator trips offline, it can very quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid more efficiently. “ According to him, Texas documented one mild localized destabilization incident involving Bitcoin mining on April 25, 2024, while multiple large-scale stabilization events occurred over the same multi-year period, including emergency grid support during the July 2022 heatwave. Consumer Cost Reduction Through Multiple Mechanisms Contrary to claims that Bitcoin miners increase residential electricity expenses, data presented by Batten from Texas between 2021 and 2024 shows that total electricity costs paid by residential customers rose 23.8%, or 7.0% when inflation-adjusted, compared to the national average increase of 24.67%. The analysis identifies five mechanisms through which Bitcoin mining reduces consumer costs: Monetizing renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted Creating competitive markets for Ancillary Services Eliminating the need for additional gas peaker plants Reducing curtailment fees Deferring grid infrastructure expenses. Jones noted “ the capability for [Bitcoin Mining] to meet our ancillary services at the lowest possible cost means lower costs for all consumers in the State of Texas. ” After the 2021 Texas blackouts, ERCOT initially proposed building gas peaker plants at an estimated cost of $18 billion, but instead integrated Bitcoin miners as a flexible load capable of rapidly reducing consumption during grid stress. Two documented international cases demonstrate direct price impacts. Norwegian residents in September 2024 experienced a 20% increase in electricity prices after Bitcoin mining operations departed. Source: CNBC (Screenshot) Additionally, CNBC reported that adding Bitcoin mining to a rural microgrid in Kenya “ dropped the price of power from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to 25 cents per kWh ” by monetizing previously wasted hydroelectric energy. Transaction Metrics and Environmental Performance Batten’s document also addresses the per-transaction energy claim, stating the metric “ is dismissed in four peer-reviewed studies (Masanet et al., 2019; Dittmar et al., 2019; Sedlmeir et al., 2020; and Sai and Vraken, 2023) as well as by Cambridge University because Bitcoin’s resource use does not come from its transactions. “ Cambridge data from 2025 showed that previous estimates overestimated Bitcoin’s electronic waste by 1204%, indicating an actual annual eWaste of 2.3 kilotons rather than the claimed 30 kilotons. Bitcoin mining has crossed the 50% sustainable energy threshold according to robust third-party data, exceeding the global average grid mix of approximately 40% renewable energy. Cambridge estimates current Bitcoin mining emissions at 39.8 MtCO2e attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from scope-2 electricity usage, with 5.5% of annual carbon debt offset through methane mitigation from oil and gas operations. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is once again edging closer to uncharted territory as the network prepares for its first adjustment of 2026. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/Ez9uxnC3rE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 29, 2025 Notably, according to a recent Cryptonews report, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rose to 148.2 trillion in the final adjustment of 2025, with projections pointing toward 149 trillion by January 8, 2026, as average block times hover near 9.95 minutes.

However, $BTC has now come up against a major horizontal resistance level at $93,000. Do the bulls still have enough in the tank to break through, or is this a perfect place for a rejection? $BTC overbought: can bulls still break out? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC shows how the price has finally begun to angle upward after passing through the downtrend line, while using the major ascending trendline as a base. Nevertheless, a major horizontal resistance level was waiting at around $93,500, where it appears the price has met with rejection. There is still a chance that the bulls could make another huge effort and break up and beyond this horizontal line, but given that $BTC is overbought on all the short time frames up to the daily, it would make sense for the next reversal phase to kick in now. A possible factor for a continuation of the rally is how far down the price will drop. If the price comes back to the major ascending trendline and dips below it again, things will be pretty much back to where they were in these last several weeks of sideways up and down chop. However, if the price only makes a shallow dip, perhaps coming back to retest $90,000, and confirming it as support, the rally may be able to continue, with the key level of $93,500 being the one to break and hold above. $93,500 is a hugely important level Source: TradingView The daily chart gives a better view of the breakout so far, and also gives more perspective on the horizontal resistance at $93,500. If one looks left along this line, it can be seen that this is in fact an important price structure shelf. Going further left beyond the confines of this chart also supports this. For the $BTC price to break through this level would be huge. The next big structural level after this is at $101,000, and the price would be likely to get there fairly quickly once $93,500 can be broken and held above. Notwithstanding, there are some bearish indications in the chart that need to be dealt with. Firstly, the Stochastic RSI indicators on all the short term time frames are at or near their top limits. These will need to reset, at least somewhat, before the price can truly start to motor higher. Secondly, the $BTC price is still in a bear flag. The upper limits of this flag could correspond with a potential price of around $100,000, which would match the horizontal resistance, making this a difficult barrier for the bulls to break. Lastly, the 200-day simple moving average is angled downward, which has only happened once in this entire bull cycle, and never at this much of an incline. It must be said that the price has now regained the 50-day SMA, which is perhaps starting to curl back round to the upside. A textbook breakout Source: TradingView When looking at the $BTC price in the weekly time frame it is perhaps best not to overcomplicate matters. What can be seen is a textbook breakout of a falling wedge - a pattern that would normally result in a break to the upside rather than the downside. While the price is admittedly in a bear flag, if there is going to be a strong rally back to the highs, there is only one direction to go, and that’s up and through the top of said bear flag. Much overthinking of what might possibly happen is going to be going on in the heads of most traders and investors. That said, investing is about looking at the balance of probabilities, and then going with what seems most likely. Good risk management will help if the market starts to reverse again. Finally, arguably one of the most reliable indicators is the Stochastic RSI - especially in the higher time frames. It’s rather like the tide going in and out. Looking left at the last time the Stochastic RSI indicators moved up from the bottom in this weekly time frame, it can be observed that a strong rally ensued. Once the indicator lines both cross the 20.00 level, this is the point where upside price momentum really kicks in. This looks as though it is soon to take place.

According to exclusive data from the leading derivatives exchange Deribit, the total open interest for these specific call options has ballooned to a staggering $1.45 billion. This remarkable trend, first reported by CoinDesk, signals a profound shift in institutional and sophisticated retail sentiment, moving beyond mere speculation into a structured financial gamble on Bitcoin’s near-term destiny. The sheer scale of these positions introduces complex new dynamics into the crypto market’s underlying mechanics. Bitcoin Options Market Reaches Unprecedented Scale The derivatives landscape for Bitcoin has matured dramatically since its inception. Currently, the focal point is the January expiry cycle for call options with a $100,000 strike price. Data reveals that $828 million of the total $1.45 billion in open interest is set to mature this very month, creating a significant event horizon for price action. Furthermore, traders added 420 BTC worth of exposure to these contracts in just the last 24 hours, demonstrating accelerating interest. This activity is not isolated; it reflects a broader institutionalization of crypto finance, where options provide both hedging tools and high-leverage speculation. For context, the total open interest for all Bitcoin options across major exchanges now routinely exceeds $20 billion, establishing derivatives as a primary price discovery venue. The Mechanics of a $100,000 Bet Understanding this surge requires a grasp of options basics. A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase Bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike) by a specific date. Traders buying these $100,000 calls are betting Bitcoin’s price will exceed that level by January expiry. They pay a premium for this right. If BTC trades below $100,000 at expiry, the options expire worthless, and the premium is lost. However, the potential profit is theoretically unlimited above the strike price. This structure allows for massive leverage; a small move in BTC’s price can lead to exponential gains or losses on the option’s value. Gamma Exposure and the Dealer Squeeze Catalyst Beyond simple bullish bets, advanced analysis from firms like QCP Capital reveals a more intricate market force at play: the gamma squeeze. When traders buy large volumes of call options, the institutions selling those options (known as dealers or market makers) must hedge their risk. They typically do this by dynamically buying or selling the underlying asset—Bitcoin. The current market state places these dealers in a “short gamma” position. Essentially, as Bitcoin’s price rises, dealers are forced to buy more BTC to stay hedged, which itself pushes the price higher, forcing more buying. QCP Capital notes that this reflexive buying pressure could intensify dramatically if Bitcoin surpasses the $94,000 threshold. Concurrently, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures on Deribit has exceeded 30% annualized. This high rate indicates extreme leverage and bullish sentiment in the futures market, often preceding volatile moves. The convergence of high futures funding and massive call option interest creates a potentially explosive feedback loop. Dealers hedging their short options exposure buy spot BTC, driving the price up, which triggers more call option buying and further dealer hedging. Short Gamma: A dealer’s position where their hedging requires them to buy an asset as its price rises and sell as it falls, amplifying market moves. Open Interest: The total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. Strike Price: The predetermined price at which an option can be exercised. Historical Precedents and Market Cycles This phenomenon is not entirely new. Similar patterns of escalating call option interest preceded major Bitcoin rallies in late 2020 and early 2021. During those cycles, concentrated buying of call options at strikes like $50,000 and $60,000 created dealer hedging flows that contributed to the parabolic move to an all-time high. Market analysts now watch the “options skew,” which measures the implied volatility of calls versus puts. A skew favoring calls, as seen currently, indicates traders are willing to pay more for bullish protection and speculation. The current scale, however, is unprecedented in dollar terms, reflecting the market’s increased depth and capital inflow. Broader Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem The ramifications of this options activity extend far beyond trader portfolios. Firstly, it signals strong institutional belief in a near-term catalyst, such as potential regulatory clarity or ETF inflows. Secondly, it increases market fragility. A sudden price drop could lead to rapid unwinding of these leveraged positions, exacerbating downside volatility. Thirdly, it draws more traditional finance players into the crypto space, as they engage in complex volatility arbitrage and hedging strategies around these large options blocks. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing this derivatives activity. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have highlighted the need for robust risk management in crypto derivatives to protect investors and maintain systemic stability. The concentration of risk in specific strike prices and expiry dates, as seen with the January $100K calls, represents a known point of potential market stress. Key Metrics: Bitcoin $100K Jan Call Options Metric Value Significance Total Open Interest $1.45 Billion Scale of total bets Open Interest Maturing This Month $828 Million Immediate market impact 24-Hour Increase 420 BTC Momentum of new bets Critical Price Level (per QCP) $94,000 Potential trigger for gamma squeeze Deribit BTC Perp Funding Rate >30% annualized Indicator of extreme leverage Conclusion The aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin call options targeting a $100,000 price by January represents a defining moment for cryptocurrency markets. It is a high-stakes wager backed by billions in capital, driven by sophisticated market mechanics like gamma exposure and dealer hedging flows. While this activity reflects profound bullish conviction, it also layers significant leverage and complexity into the market structure. The coming weeks will critically test whether this options-driven momentum can propel Bitcoin to new heights or if it sets the stage for a violent correction. Regardless of the outcome, the scale of these Bitcoin options bets underscores the irreversible maturation of crypto into a complex, derivatives-heavy asset class where traditional market forces now play a decisive role. FAQs Q1: What is a Bitcoin call option? A Bitcoin call option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right to purchase Bitcoin at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiry). Traders use them to bet on price increases with limited downside risk (the premium paid). Q2: Why is the $100,000 strike price for January significant? The concentration of over $1.4 billion in open interest at this specific strike and expiry creates a major “options wall.” It becomes a focal point for market sentiment and can influence price action as dealers hedge their exposure, potentially creating a self-reinforcing move toward that target. Q3: What does “short gamma” mean for the market? When options dealers are “short gamma,” they must buy the underlying asset (Bitcoin) as its price rises to hedge their risk. This buying can accelerate upward price moves, creating a feedback loop known as a “gamma squeeze” that can lead to rapid, volatile rallies. Q4: What happens if Bitcoin does not reach $100,000 by January? If Bitcoin’s price is below $100,000 at the January expiry, all these call options will expire worthless. The buyers will lose the premiums they paid, and the dealers who sold the options will keep that premium as profit. This could lead to significant capital destruction for the option buyers. Q5: How does high perpetual futures funding relate to options activity? An extremely high funding rate (like 30%+) indicates that traders are heavily leveraged in perpetual futures contracts, betting on continued price rises. This often coincides with aggressive call option buying. Both are signs of overheated bullish sentiment and can contribute to increased market volatility and the potential for sharp corrections.

Artificial intelligence ( AI ) models appear to agree, as their latest projections likewise point to additional upside potential over the coming weeks The outlook is supported by Solana’s push above the $132 resistance level and a bullish trendline emerging near $135 at the time of writing, the highest level since December 12. Solana price improves, reclaims key technical levels Most notably, the MACD histogram turned positive at 1.87, while the 7-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) climbed to 74.7, indicating strong upside pressure. At the same time, a break above the 200-hour Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) near $134 also appeared to trigger algorithmic buying and short covering, accelerating the move. Broader market tailwinds added to the upside. Bitcoin ( BTC ), for instance, is holding well above $92,000, helping stabilize risk appetite, while major altcoins such as XRP are also advancing, helping the total cryptocurrency market capitalization rise to about $3.15 trillion. AI Solana price prediction for January 2026 With charts hinting at possible short-term gains, Finbold used its AI-driven price prediction tool to gauge Solana month-end price. Blending inputs from ChatGPT , Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4, the model outlined a range of bullish outcomes. Finbold AI SOL price forecast. Source: Finbold On average, the three models estimated Solana would reach $139.05 by the end of January, suggesting a 2.9% rise from where it currently trades. Claude Sonnet 4 provided the most bullish scenario, with a possible 5.45% advance, whereas Gemini 2.5 Flash and ChatGPT called for a 3.15% and 0.27% gain, respectively. Finbold AI SOL technical analysis. Source: Finbold Taken together, the technical setup and general sector stabilization reflected in the AI-driven forecast point to a largely bullish outlook for Solana into the end of January. If SOL can secure a daily close above $138, it could open the door toward the average predicted $139.05 and eventually $144.74, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level . Conversely, railure to hold the $132 threshold could prompt a pullback toward initial support at $130.

According to data compiled from on-chain trackers, spending moved from $14.6 million in January to $91.3 million by the end of December. Major Cards Driving The Growth Most of the rise was concentrated in a small group of cards. Data shows that EtherFi’s Visa card accounted for $55.4 million of the total, more than double second-place Cypher’s $20.5 million. The six cards tracked include offerings from GnosisPay, Cypher, EtherFi, Avici Money, Exa App, and Moonwell. Spending Patterns And Data Source Data from Dune Analytics shows the figures measure net spend on Visa-issued crypto cards run by blockchain projects partnering with Visa. The growth appears to be steady across the year rather than a single spike, with month-by-month net spend rising through 2025. According to Polygon researcher @obchakevich_ on X Sunday, these numbers show that crypto cards are gaining traction with users and highlight how important crypto and stablecoins have become for Visa’s worldwide payment network. . @Visa continues its expansion into crypto, steadily increasing spend volume through crypto cards such as @gnosispay , @ether_fi cash, @Cypher_HQ_ , @AviciMoney , @Exa_App , @MoonwellDeFi card, and others. Looking at the analytics for 6 crypto cards on Visa, we can see rapid… pic.twitter.com/Z5JzpBggI9 — Alex (@obchakevich_) January 4, 2026 What This Means For Payments Analysts and researchers say this jump suggests some crypto cards are moving into regular everyday use for certain groups of customers. Based on reports, cardholders are using crypto balances to pay for routine purchases instead of always converting to fiat first. That shift could make stablecoins and crypto rails more relevant for payments firms and banks. Visa Moves On Stablecoins And Advisory Work Visa has been active on the stablecoin front and has signaled plans to support broader stablecoin infrastructure for payments. Reports show Visa launched initiatives to help banks and partners build out stablecoin solutions and set up advisory work around tokenized money late in 2025. Those moves line up with the card-use data, which some observers see as a practical test of crypto payment flows at scale. Growth on a small set of cards does not mean mass adoption yet. Observers caution that regulation, consumer protection, and merchant acceptance remain key constraints. At the same time, the numbers do show that crypto-linked payments are no longer just a niche experiment; they are being used for real transactions by measurable groups of users.

On-Chain Data Reveals Surprise Resilience,https://cryptonews.com/news/us-venezuela-crisis-bitcoin-on-chain-data-resilience/,cryptonews,"Bitcoin markets showed little sign of panic over the weekend, despite the geopolitical risk exploding as a result of a dramatic escalation between the United States and Venezuela that culminated in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Although the headlines would normally shake risk assets, Bitcoin stood just below the $90,000 price , which brings the question as to whether there still is a possibility of a sudden sell-off or the market has become more resilient to geopolitical shocks. The price of Bitcoin held near the $90,000 level on Saturday, even as geopolitical tensions between the United States and Venezuela escalated. #Bitcoin #Venezuela https://t.co/9p6Nyb9hQ6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 4, 2026 Bitcoin Holds Steady as Venezuela Crisis Grips Global Headlines This happened later on Friday, when the US conducted airstrikes in and around Caracas and declared that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained and were flown to the United States. The US officials indicated that Maduro would be charged in New York in matters of narco-terrorism. The operation marked the most direct US military action in Latin America in decades and immediately dominated global news cycles. Yet Bitcoin’s reaction was muted as Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000 before stabilizing and recovering, ranging between $91,000 and $93,000 through the weekend. Source: TradingView The lack of panic stood out given the scale of the news and contrasted with past episodes where conflict headlines drove abrupt sell-offs. On-chain data helps explain the calm, as a recent CryptoQuant analysis focusing on Exchange Netflow, which tracks whether Bitcoin is moving onto or off exchanges, showed no surge in inflows linked to the Venezuela news. Source: CryptoQuant Historically, spikes in exchange inflows signal preparation to sell; this time, the data suggested otherwise. In past conflicts, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and flare-ups in the Middle East, prices were volatile, but sustained spikes in exchange inflows were limited. That pattern has persisted since 2023, suggesting investors increasingly treat localized military conflicts as short-term noise rather than systemic threats. That absence of inflows points to caution rather than fear, with holders choosing to sit tight instead of rushing for liquidity. Crypto Shorts Wiped Out as Downside Fears Fail to Land Derivatives data paints a similar picture, with Coinglass data showing that there were $257.3 million in crypto liquidations over the past 24 hours, driven largely by short positions. Source: Coinglass Roughly $182.6 million came from traders betting on price declines, while long liquidations totaled $74.7 million. The imbalance suggests recent price action moved against bearish positioning, reinforcing the idea that downside expectations tied to the conflict failed to materialize. The market’s calm reaction is also tied to how investors distinguish between different types of geopolitical risk. Historically, Bitcoin has responded more strongly to events that directly affect global capital flows, such as regulatory crackdowns, sanctions enforcement, or major US-China economic tensions . Trump threatened China with 155% tariffs starting Nov 1, following an $8.5B Australia minerals agreement. Over $329M in crypto liquidated. #China #Tariff #Australia https://t.co/nlagSWbX6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 21, 2025 By contrast, military actions confined to a single region have tended to cause brief volatility without altering broader market structure. That distinction matters in Venezuela’s case, particularly because the country is not just a geopolitical flashpoint but also a notable crypto holder. Publicly available data indicates the country holds at least 240 BTC, valued at roughly $22 million at current prices, as part of its reserves. Source: BitcoinTreasuries However, intelligence and market speculation point to far larger reserves accumulated over several years through sanctions workarounds. While those estimates remain unverified and contested, they have fueled discussion about what might occur should the authorities of the US ultimately seize or freeze any crypto assets tied to the Venezuelan government. Market participants noted that any confirmed US government seizure would most probably put the assets under long-term legal or custodial processing and leave them out of circulation and alleviate near-term supply pressure.

Finbold analysis shows Bitcoin lost over 7,000 millionaire wallets in 2025 as wealth concentrated among larger holders. Between January 1 and December 31, 2025, the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least $1 million fell by 7,485, leaving a total of 148,084 millionaire addresses by year-end. Data shows that Bitcoin millionaire addresses declined from 155,569 at the start of 2025 to 148,084 by December 31, even as spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions in inflows throughout the year. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Within that total, addresses holding $10 million or more actually increased, rising from 15,319 to 16,368, suggesting that wealth concentration intensified even as mid-tier millionaire wallets declined. On average, the net loss equates to approximately 21 Bitcoin millionaire addresses disappearing per day over the year. It is important to note that a single individual can control multiple Bitcoin addresses, meaning wallet counts do not map one-to-one with unique individuals. Still, the trend offers a useful proxy for changes in on-chain wealth distribution. A sharp reversal after a strong mid-year recovery The decline was not linear. By the end of Q3 2025 , Bitcoin had added a net 20,688 millionaire addresses year-to-date, driven by strong price momentum earlier in the year. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); However, the final quarter saw a pronounced reversal, wiping out earlier gains and pushing the full-year figure into negative territory. The data suggests that profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and late-year volatility played a significant role in the drawdown. Bitcoin ended 2025 lower despite institutional momentum The contraction in millionaire addresses occurred even as Bitcoin remained firmly embedded in institutional portfolios. Bitcoin began 2025 trading near $92,600 and ended the year closer to $87,100, reflecting a net price decline despite sustained demand through regulated investment vehicles. The divergence highlights a key theme of 2025, while institutional adoption accelerated, price appreciation failed to keep pace with earlier expectations, squeezing mid-range holders more than large allocators. Compared with 2024, which saw 56,325 new Bitcoin millionaire addresses , an average of 154 per day, 2025 marked a clear shift in on-chain wealth dynamics. Rather than broad-based wealth creation, the year was characterized by consolidation at the top, with larger holders increasing their footprint while smaller millionaire wallets exited. Finbold’s analysis suggests that 2025 was less a year of mass enrichment and more a period of redistribution, reinforcing the view that Bitcoin’s maturation increasingly favors scale, patience, and long-term capital over speculative cycles.

Gold Cooldown Signals Crypto Window,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-btc-time-gold-cooldown-signals-crypto-window/,cryptopotato,"Bitcoin is trading near $92,500 at press time, showing a 1% gain over the past day. The asset has now risen for five straight sessions, marking the longest upward streak since October. Meanwhile, trading volume has crossed $37 billion. Other large-cap assets like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have also posted gains between 0.7% and 3% in the past 24 hours. Gold Slows After Rally, Bitcoin Gains Attention Analysts are observing a pattern in how BTC and gold have behaved over past market cycles. Chart data from 2016 to 2026 shows that Bitcoin tends to rise after the precious metal peaks and slows down. This setup was seen around 2017 and again in 2020. Both periods followed gold reaching a local high before entering a period of lower activity. Michaël van de Poppe pointed out this recurring structure. He noted that gold’s strong run may now be cooling off. “It’s very expectable to see a corrective period on gold,” he said. He also described the next 1.5 to 2 years as a period when Bitcoin and crypto may see stronger price moves, similar to what followed previous gold peaks. In addition, BTC has broken above its earlier resistance and is trading near levels last seen before its recent correction. According to van de Poppe, the current zone near $93,000 is the last key area before a possible move toward $100,000. There we go! Final hurdle before $100K: that’s where #Bitcoin is currently at. I wouldn’t expect a clear-cut, immediate breakout; however, I do expect to see it happen in the coming week. The year started bullish. pic.twitter.com/E8XvJ3S3y9 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 5, 2026 While not expecting a fast breakout, he said a move higher may follow soon. Support levels have formed between $85,000 and $88,500. A deeper pullback could test the $80,500 range, which marked a double bottom last month. Rising trading volumes suggest buyers are active as Bitcoin approaches higher levels. Short-Term Moves and Market Focus Trader Merlijn stated that Bitcoin broke above $91,000 and is now holding above that mark. The asset targets mentioned include $93,000 and $94,600 in the near term. He said , “As long as $88.5K holds, the bias remains up. Lose it? We switch to damage control.” Daan Crypto Trades commented on the seasonal strength of Bitcoin in the first quarter. He said past Q1 periods, even in weaker years, have seen relatively steady performance. As the new year begins, analysts are watching to see if this trend continues. Price projections vary, with some analysts forecasting new highs above $126,000 or even reaching $210,000 later this year. The post Bitcoin’s (BTC) Time?

Data from CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, revealed on January 4 that only OKX (+0.001), Kraken (+0.004), and Upbit (+0.062) showed positive December monthly averages out of the ten top exchanges. The remaining seven all showed a negative buying power ratio. Bitget showed the lowest buying power ratio of -1.2083. On the favorable buying power ratio. Upbit exchange showed the highest positive buying power ratio of 0.4209. Buying power weakens as regional capital splits On-chain data revealed that Upbit barely sustained positive buying strength at 0.4209, while Coinbase advanced recorded -0.0878, and Kraken was near-neutral at -0.0119. In December, regional capital patterns showed divergence. Although there has been a slight improvement in the buying power ratios, deployment is still insufficient to create strong convictions. Crypto exchanges reveal negative buying power ratios, reflecting dominant selling pressure. Source: CryptoQuant As of January 3, Binance posted a modest increase in the buying power ratio from -0.093 in late December to 0.064. Binance recovered in late December, rising from -0.277 to positive 0.059 before falling. In the month, the weekly decline reached a peak of -0.200 on December 21 before turning around. CryptoQuant revealed that professionals are lowering exposures rather than increasing positions despite Bitcoin stabilizing at $90,000. A CryptoQuant expert clarified that the buying power ratio is used to compare the velocity of BTC withdrawals with stablecoin capital inflow . The analyst further explained that the negative buying power ratios indicate that inflow capital is leaving faster than it is arriving. Stablecoin saw net inflows of $436 million and outflows of $3.7 billion in December of last year, yielding a ratio of 0.117. The ratio of 0.117 was the first positive result since early December, despite being much below the 1.0 level, which indicates a true accumulation zone. The 30-day ratio remained at -0.126 level. At the -0.126 level, stablecoins experienced $1.96 billion in withdrawals compared to $15.6 billion in BTC withdrawals. Over different periods, the same weakening ratio was seen. In a period of 365 days, the weakening ratio remained at 0.067, and 90 days at 0.105. Binance saw a mean monthly inflow of 21.7 BTC last month. The monthly inflow has risen from 0.86 in early January 2024, two years ago. The average size of each deposit has increased by 34 times. Average BTC per incoming transaction metrics revealed that whales are now more active on Binance . Exchange Bitcoin reserves decrease as consolidation rises The CryptoQuant data revealed that there has been professional consolidation on leading exchanges and a slight supply reduction at the same time. On January 4, CryptoQuant reported how exchange reserves movements reflect a comparable pattern of supply concentration, with BTC increasing its move onto top-tier platforms. CryptoQuant analyzed that Coinbase gained while the exchange Bitcoin reserves dropped by 6,650 coins weekly. The exchange Bitcoin reserves dropped by $612 million as a result of a 6,650 coin decline. Seven out of ten leading exchanges had outflows, according to on-chain statistics, resulting in a net loss of 0.293%. The 0.293% decline indicates a modest tightening of supply that sustains a long-term positive structure without indicating an immediate effect on pricing. CryptoQuant revealed that Coinbase reported a 1,648 BTC increase by the end of last month. Binance saw a 4,684 BTC absolute decline. At 3,872 BTC, Kraken experienced the second-largest absolute decrease. Smaller exchanges like KuCoin and Gate.io experienced weekly drops of 3.59% and 3.66%, respectively. Total exchange reserves are currently at 2.27 million BTC worth $209 billion. Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are the top 3 exchanges that control almost 82.7% of the total exchange reserves concentration.

When it comes to the top 100 coins, 87 coins saw increases. Of these, one is double-digit. Render (RENDER) appreciated 16% to $2.1. Bonk (BONK) is next with a 6.2% increase to $0.00001211. On the other hand, Provenance Blockchain (HASH) fell the most: 10.2% to $0.02653. Canton (CC) is next, having decreased by 6% to the price of $0.1462. Meanwhile, the big four accounting firm PwC is pushing deeper into crypto after years of a cautious stance. “The Genius Act and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class,” Paul Griggs, PwC’s US senior partner, said. “The tokenization of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem.” Moreover, Vitalik Buterin said Ethereum solved blockchain’s trilemma via zero-knowledge EVMs and PeerDAS technology. This enables decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, “shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote. Now that ZKEVMs are at alpha stage (production-quality performance, remaining work is safety) and PeerDAS is live on mainnet, it's time to talk more about what this combination means for Ethereum. These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2026 ‘Investors Add Digital Gold to Their Portfolios’ Petr Kozyakov, Co-Founder and CEO at payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo , commented that crypto markets are “in the green as investors add digital gold to their portfolios amid positioning for the year ahead.” Bitcoin has surpassed $92,000, leading the market higher with Ethereum and Solana also recording gains. Per the CEO, “a shift in mood across the digital token space has been underlined by a resurgence in interest in the meme coin sector, with Shiba Inu and Pepe making a loud entry to 2026.” “While the cryptocurrency space experienced a severe drop in sentiment in the final months of 2025, fundamentals in the sector remain strong as the underlying infrastructure evolves with assets such as stablecoins continuing to attract increasing levels of liquidity,” Kozyakov wrote. Moreover, Derivatives Desk of Laser Digital noted that we’ll see “a flurry of jobs data out this week,” coming from the US. Most importantly, the non-farm payrolls (NFP) data is out on Friday, they added, and consensus is headline number +55,000 and Unemployment Rate (UER) 4.50%. Given that January cuts are barely priced now, “a weak number would likely trigger market to price more cuts for January and push the yields lower.” “Expect UER to matter more than headline number like last time. A higher UER could be negative for risk assets given most investors are expecting goldilocks scenario on US economy,” they said. Moreover, “geopolitical tension has been rising as well. So far, the market reaction to the weekend events has been muted, but it could have some spillover effect on places that are already under tension.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Monday morning, BTC stood at $92,483. For the majority of the past 24 hours, the coin traded sideways at the $91,000 level. It then jumped from $91,138 to the intraday high of $93,169. Over the past seven days, BTC appreciated 2.9%, moving between $86,979 and $92,999. It’s also up by 3.1% in a month and down by 5.8% in a year and 26.6% from its all-time high. If Bitcoin keeps the level above $90,000, it could run to and above $93,500 and $94,600. This would open doors towards the $98,000 zone in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,155. Much like BTC, ETH traded sideways at the $3,100 level for much of the past day. The price surged from the intraday low of $3,123 to the high of $3,209. Looking at the past week, we find a 4.1% increase. The coin moved within the $2,916 – $3,198 range. It’s up just below 4% in a month and is down 13% in a year and 36.2% from its all-time high. If ETH pushes above $3,430, it could see a further rise to $3,600 and $4,000 later in the year. Yet, a fall below $3,010 could see it pull back below $3,000. That said, Buterin unveiling the ZK-EVM and PeerDAS roadmap could strengthen the long-term outlook with strong fundamentals and tech innovation.

This isn’t to say that market participants aren’t still cautious. However, they seem to be more optimistic about the short- and mid-term outlooks. ETFs Start 2026 With Inflows The first trading day of the year, Friday, 2 January, saw the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posting positive flows of $471.14 million . The total net inflow now stands at $57.08 billion. Of the twelve BTC ETFs, nine saw inflows, and none recorded outflows. BlackRock posted the highest amount of $287.37 million. It’s followed by Fidelity’s $88.08 million and Bitwise’s $41.49 million. Moreover, the US ETH ETFs also posted positive flows, with $174.43 million on 2 January. The total net inflow hovers around $12.5 billion. Five of the nine funds recorded inflows, and none posted outflows. Grayscale took in $103.72 million in total on this day. Moreover, BlackRock recorded $47.16 million in inflows. Meanwhile, according to on-chain data cited by CryptoOnchain , whales deposited some $2.4 billion to Binance , split nearly evenly between Bitcoin and Ether. However, analysts noted that “crucially, this surge in risk-asset deposits was not accompanied by new buying power.” Bitcoin Inflows to Binance are Increasingly Whale-Sized “A 34x increase in the average size of each deposit. This metric reflects the average BTC per inflow transaction, signaling that larger holders are now more active on Binance.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/SkpgMUG8vP — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 4, 2026 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today?

However, according to ESG researcher Daniel Batten’s Saturday X article, there are nine theories about crypto that are dumbfounding. Batten vehemently disagreed with how the Dow Jones blasted Harvard University for allocating part of its endowment to a “fake currency and money-laundering tool that is also an environmental catastrophe.“ “Every nascent disruptive technology is accompanied by claims that are based on lack of understanding, lack of data, and a fear of something unknown. This happened to the bicycle, the radio, and the Internet. It has also happened with Bitcoin mining,” he wrote. Batten: Energy misuse and electronic waste claims are unfounded One of the accusations the article cited was that Bitcoin consumes excessive energy, water, and is leading in electronic waste per transaction. Batten said the theory is fundamentally flawed and has been rejected by four peer-reviewed papers, alongside assessments by Cambridge University. The studies conclude that Bitcoin’s resource use is not driven by transaction volume, which means transaction throughput can increase without drawing excessive energy, water, or hardware consumption. The per-transaction metric’s origin came from Alex de Vries’ “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem” commentary published in 2018. Batten insists the analysis was non-empirical, and it was later discredited, even though several media agencies had already consumed the perception as reality. In his analytical critique of Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption , De Vries measured energy per transaction and extended the same methodology to emissions, water use, and electronic waste. Cambridge University later found the Digiconomist founder had overestimated Bitcoin mining’s electronic waste by 1,204%, placing annual eWaste at 2.3 kilotonnes and below de Vries’ 30 kilotonnes. Bitcoin does not destabilize electricity grids and increase prices Batten also debunked the myth about Bitcoin mining causing a distortion in power grids through research from Duke University. The North Carolina learning institution concluded that controllable load resources like the crypto coin’s mining can instead stabilize grids. These findings are supported by data from ERCOT, the Texas grid operator of the largest concentration of Bitcoin mining in the world. According to ERCOT records, Bitcoin miners provide frequency regulation and demand response services. During Texas’s July 2022 heatwave, mining operations reportedly cut back energy demand during grid stress and helped prevent outages. ERCOT documented only one mild grid-destabilizing incident, which came in April 2024. “Bitcoin mining operations have found a way to come into the market and take some of that excess wind in off-peak periods. Then it can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers… And if a generator trips offline, it can very quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid more efficiently,” said former ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones. On the energy consumption side of the criticism, Batten compared US electricity cost data from 2021 to 2024, showing inflation-adjusted increases of 7.7% nationally and 7.0% in Texas. He said no peer-reviewed study supports the claim that Bitcoin mining raises consumer power prices, but there are cases where it can lower costs, including reducing curtailment fees and investments in gas peaker plants. In September 2024, Norwegian residents reportedly learned that Bitcoin mining had kept power prices 20% lower for years, before prices jumped after miners exited the grid. CNBC reported that adding a Bitcoin mine to rural microgrids in Kenya reduced electricity costs from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to 25 cents. Carbon emissions, renewable energy, and methane mitigation Cambridge University also stated that comparing industries to nations is “presenter bias,” because environmental policy focuses on transforming energy systems rather than reducing absolute consumption. Moreover, per Batten’s own assessment, Bitcoin mining is the only global industry with third-party data showing more than 50% sustainable energy usage and emissions at 39.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The ESG researcher propounded that Bitcoin mining produces only indirect emissions from electricity use, similar to electric vehicles. EVs produced 80 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in China and the United States alone. BTC mining emissions chart. Source: Cambridge University Batten also rejected assertions that mining diverts renewable energy from other users, saying ERCOT data and Brad Jones coined mining a “non-rival energy user” that powers down when prices rise. Concluding his rebuttal piece, he shared peer-reviewed studies of mining integration that almost fully eliminate wasted energy on microgrids while cutting operating costs by 46.5%.

This strategic pivot, first reported by Cointelegraph, transforms digital asset access from a reactive service into a proactive portfolio strategy. Consequently, the move signals a profound shift in how major traditional financial institutions perceive and integrate Bitcoin investment vehicles. Moreover, it provides millions of clients with guided, mainstream exposure to the cryptocurrency market through regulated and familiar financial products. Bank of America’s Strategic Shift on Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bank of America’s new policy represents a decisive evolution from its previous, restrictive stance. Previously, advisors could only facilitate transactions for spot Bitcoin ETFs on an unsolicited basis. This meant that highly qualified investor clients had to initiate the request themselves. Now, advisors possess the explicit authorization to suggest these products directly. They can recommend specific allocations, typically between 1% and 4% of a client’s portfolio. This framework treats cryptocurrency exposure as a strategic asset class rather than a speculative outlier. The bank has officially sanctioned a select group of spot Bitcoin ETFs for recommendation. This curated list includes some of the largest and most liquid funds in the market: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT): The largest spot Bitcoin ETF by assets, managed by the world’s biggest asset manager. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): A major offering from the giant financial services firm. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): Known for its focus on transparency and low fees. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC): A spin-off from the massive Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), designed with a competitive fee structure. This selection process underscores the bank’s focus on credibility, liquidity, and institutional-grade custody solutions. Furthermore, it provides a clear, vetted pathway for advisors navigating a rapidly growing sector. The Broader Context of Institutional Crypto Adoption Bank of America’s policy change does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, it reflects a broader, accelerating trend of institutional acceptance following regulatory milestones. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 served as the critical catalyst. Since that pivotal moment, these funds have amassed tens of billions of dollars in assets under management. They have demonstrated robust market infrastructure and daily trading volumes that rival many established equity ETFs. Other major wirehouses and registered investment advisor (RIA) platforms have undertaken similar, though often more cautious, evaluations. For instance, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are reportedly conducting due diligence on allowing broker-sold access. Bank of America’s move, however, is particularly significant due to its scale. With thousands of advisors and trillions in client assets, its endorsement carries substantial weight. It effectively normalizes Bitcoin exposure within the framework of traditional financial planning. Analyzing the Recommended Allocation Strategy The suggested 1% to 4% portfolio allocation is a calculated approach rooted in modern portfolio theory. Financial analysts often cite this range as a “satellite” or “tactical” allocation. It aims to provide potential diversification benefits and non-correlated return streams without introducing excessive volatility to the overall portfolio. This recommendation aligns with guidance from several prominent investment strategists and economists who have long argued for a small, strategic allocation to digital assets. Advisors will likely base the exact percentage on a client’s individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial goals. The allocation framework provides a structured, disciplined method for incorporating a high-growth, high-volatility asset. It moves the conversation away from speculative trading and towards long-term strategic asset allocation. Implications for Financial Advisors and the Wealth Management Industry This policy shift places new responsibilities and opportunities squarely on the desks of Bank of America’s financial advisors. Advisors must now educate themselves comprehensively on Bitcoin’s fundamentals, the mechanics of spot ETFs, and their associated risks. They need to understand custody differences, fee structures, and tax implications to provide competent advice. The bank will undoubtedly roll out extensive training programs and compliance guidelines to support this transition. For the wealth management industry at large, this move creates competitive pressure. Other major institutions may accelerate their own plans to offer similar advisory services to retain clients and advisors. The table below outlines the potential immediate impacts: Stakeholder Primary Impact Bank of America Advisors Gain a new tool for client portfolios and a topic for proactive client engagement. BofA Clients Receive guided, convenient access to crypto within their existing advisory relationship. Spot Bitcoin ETF Issuers (IBIT, FBTC, etc.) Access a massive new distribution channel and inflow potential from advised assets. Competitor Firms (Morgan Stanley, UBS, etc.) Face increased urgency to formulate and announce their own advisory policies. The Cryptocurrency Market Benefits from enhanced legitimacy and a steady, long-term demand source from institutional portfolios. This development could significantly increase the stability of Bitcoin markets. Advisory-driven investments typically follow a dollar-cost averaging approach rather than speculative timing. Therefore, they may contribute to reduced volatility over the long term. Navigating Risks and Regulatory Compliance Despite this progressive step, Bank of America and its advisors must operate within a strict regulatory environment. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the SEC continue to emphasize the importance of suitability and risk disclosure. Advisors must ensure that any recommendation for a spot Bitcoin ETF aligns with a client’s investment profile. They have a duty to clearly explain the unique risks of the underlying asset, including extreme price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and technological risks. The bank’s compliance department will have established rigorous procedures for these conversations. Documentation of client understanding and explicit consent will be paramount. This measured, compliant rollout is characteristic of how large institutions integrate innovative but complex products. It prioritizes investor protection while gradually expanding access. Conclusion Bank of America’s authorization for its advisors to recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a pivotal moment in finance. It bridges the once-distant worlds of traditional wealth management and digital asset investment. By providing a structured, percentage-based allocation framework through approved funds like IBIT and FBTC, the bank is institutionalizing cryptocurrency exposure. This decision will likely catalyze further adoption across the advisory landscape, bringing a new wave of long-term, strategic capital into the ecosystem. Ultimately, it represents a mature next phase for spot Bitcoin ETFs, transitioning them from novel products to potential portfolio staples for a broader investor base. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Bank of America change regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bank of America changed its internal policy from only allowing advisors to execute unsolicited client requests for spot Bitcoin ETFs to now permitting advisors to proactively recommend and allocate these ETFs as part of a client’s portfolio strategy. Q2: Which specific spot Bitcoin ETFs can Bank of America advisors recommend? Advisors are officially guided to recommend four specific funds: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). Q3: What is the recommended allocation to cryptocurrency in a portfolio? Bank of America’s guidance suggests advisors consider an allocation of approximately 1% to 4% of a client’s total portfolio to spot Bitcoin ETFs, depending on the individual’s risk profile and investment objectives. Q4: How does this differ from what other major banks are doing? While several other large banks are exploring or allowing limited transactions, Bank of America’s move to explicitly empower its nationwide advisor force to make recommendations is among the most direct and significant endorsements from a major wirehouse to date. Q5: Does this mean Bank of America is bullish on Bitcoin? The policy change indicates that Bank of America recognizes client demand and the strategic role Bitcoin ETFs can play in diversified portfolios. It is a service and product adoption decision based on regulatory developments and market maturity, rather than a direct price opinion on Bitcoin itself.

The leading cryptocurrencies could rally higher in the near term as the bulls take full control of the market. Financial markets react to the US operations in Venezuela The cryptocurrency market has started the new year on a bullish note, with Bitcoin adding over 3% to its value in the last seven days. The positive performance has seen Bitcoin hit the $93k level a few hours ago and could rally higher in the near term. The rally comes as the cryptocurrency market reacts to the United States’ operation in Venezuela. While speaking to The Block. Min Jung, research associate of Presto Research, stated that BTC’s performance aligns with the rally recorded by the broader financial markets. The analyst added that, “The first week of the new year often sees fresh positioning from investors, and bitcoin is likely being viewed as an attractive entry point at current levels. Traders are also closely monitoring geopolitical developments, which remain a key source of potential volatility across global markets.” The United States carried out an operation in Venezuela over the weekend, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Maduro and his wife were flown to the United States and will appear in federal court at noon later today. In a press conference on Saturday, President Trump stated that the US would run Venezuela temporarily during the transition, and “get the oil flowing.” He added that the US is now in charge of Venezuela. Secretary of State Marco Rubio pointed out on Sunday that the US doesn’t plan to directly govern Venezuela. However, it will continue to enforce an “oil quarantine” as part of a plan to influence policy. Bitcoin eyes the $95k resistance level The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish but inefficient as the cryptocurrency has rallied over the past few days. BTC’s price closed above the upper consolidation range of $90,000 on Saturday and has surged to tap the $93k level late on Sunday. This is Bitcoin’s highest level since December 12 and has surged almost 6% in 2026. At press time, BTC is trading around $92,900 per coin. If the bullish trend continues, BTC could extend the rally toward the next resistance at $94,253, with a liquidity level at $95k also a target. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart reads 74, above the neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum is gaining traction. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover above the neutral level, further supporting the bullish outlook. However, if the bulls fail to overcome the $94k resistance level, Bitcoin could face a correction and decline toward the key support level at $90,000.

BTC Eyes to Reclaim $93K Following the brutal ending of 2025, with a massive price slump from over $126,000 in early October to below $88,000 as of December 31, bitcoin’s price finally began to show revival signs as of January 2. The asset quickly jumped past $88,000 and aimed at $90,000 on Friday, where it saw some resistance at first but managed to reclaim that level even after the US attacked Venezuela and captured its president. On Saturday and Sunday, BTC was slowly climbing and tapped $91,500 yesterday. Monday morning began with another price increase, this time to just under $93,500, which became its highest price tag since December 12. It was stopped there and now sits just inches below $93,000, but it’s still 1.6% up on the day. Its market capitalization has risen by $100 billion since January 1 and now sits above $1.850 trillion. Its dominance over the alts has also rebounded following the drop below 57% and is now 0.2% above that line on CoinGecko. BTCUSD Jan 5.

The audit, commissioned by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund and funded by Brink, identified only two low-severity issues across the peer-to-peer layer, mempool, and consensus logic. A month earlier, Bitcoin Core released version 30.0 , removing the 80-byte OP_RETURN limit, increasing the default data carrier size to 100,000 bytes, and allowing multiple OP_RETURN outputs per transaction. Adam Back, Blockstream CEO, defended the update as containing essential security patches from “ 200 most skilled people on the planet ,” while critics warned of spam risks and potential legal liabilities.

At the same time, MSTR’s weekly chart shows continued weakness, with oversold momentum building after a long slide. Jeff Walton flags $STRC “par” test as Bitcoin holds range Jeff Walton said the ticker $STRC could trade near $100 for the next nine trading sessions if Bitcoin’s current price action stays intact. Walton posted the view on X on Monday, tying the projection directly to whether Bitcoin can keep holding its recent range. He also pointed to the last time $STRC “hit par,” which he said happened in early November and lasted about four trading days. Walton said that stretch coincided with roughly $100 million in ATM sales, shorthand for at the market share issuance. Walton framed the current setup as a repeatable pattern that could matter for liquidity and issuance activity if the stock returns to the same level. He added that an “Amplified Bitcoin” trade looked set to resume, although the post did not provide additional data beyond the timing and the prior ATM figure. $MSTR slides under long term averages as weekly RSI hits 26 Meanwhile, Strategy’s stock $MSTR stayed under pressure on the weekly chart, and the latest candles held below the major moving averages shown by TrendSpider. The chart plots the 50 week EMA near 276.53, the 100 week EMA near 246.91, and the 200 week EMA near 183.82, while price trades well beneath all three.

The weekly RSI(14) on the chart sits around 26.57, which TrendSpider referenced with the question, “Have we reached despair yet?” That print places RSI deep into oversold territory on this scale, showing heavy downside momentum.

The rebound has helped stabilize short-term sentiment, but confidence remains fragile. Many analysts continue to warn that 2026 could evolve into a broader bear market, citing weak spot demand, fading momentum, and persistent sell-side activity from larger participants. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Setup Advances: CEX Volume Hits Cycle Highs Despite Price Weakness Against this backdrop, macro headlines have re-entered the conversation. An analysis from XWIN Research Japan points to reports of a potential US military intervention in Venezuela, which have revived geopolitical risk concerns across global markets. Historically, such developments tend to increase volatility and push investors toward defensive positioning. However, Bitcoin’s reaction cannot be judged by price alone, particularly in an environment dominated by derivatives and algorithmic flows. On-chain behavior offers a more precise lens. Exchange Netflow data is especially relevant during periods of geopolitical stress, as it reflects whether holders are preparing to sell or choosing to stay sidelined. When fear dominates, exchange inflows typically surge as participants move coins onto platforms. Conversely, muted inflows or continued outflows suggest that investors are not rushing to reduce exposure, even amid unsettling headlines. Exchange Netflows Suggest Caution, Not Panic The analysis places the current geopolitical headlines into a broader historical context. During past military conflicts—most notably Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and more recent flare-ups in the Middle East—Bitcoin often experienced sharp but short-lived price volatility. However, on-chain data told a calmer story. Exchange Netflow, which captures whether coins are being moved onto exchanges to sell or withdrawn for holding, rarely deteriorated in a sustained way during those events. Since 2023, the market has shown a growing ability to absorb localized geopolitical shocks without triggering widespread liquidation behavior. The situation surrounding Venezuela appears consistent with that pattern. While headlines have introduced uncertainty and contributed to short-term price sensitivity, there is no meaningful surge of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges. The absence of elevated inflows suggests that investors are not reacting with panic. Instead, the market seems to be monitoring developments while maintaining existing exposure. Historically, Bitcoin’s more pronounced on-chain reactions have been tied to structural economic threats rather than isolated military actions. Events such as US–China trade tensions, aggressive regulatory shifts, or capital control measures tend to impact global liquidity and investor freedom more directly, leaving clearer footprints in exchange flows. At this stage, the Venezuela narrative has not crossed into that category. Exchange Netflow behavior indicates a market on alert, but not in retreat.

On the chart, this move stands out as a relief rally following a sharp breakdown from the $105,000–$110,000 region earlier in Q4. However, the broader structure still reflects a market in consolidation rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Price is currently trading below the declining short-term moving average (blue), which has acted as dynamic resistance since the November sell-off. While BTC has managed to reclaim ground above the 200-day moving average (red), this level is still relatively flat, signaling stabilization rather than renewed bullish momentum. The medium-term moving average (green) around the $100,000 area remains a critical barrier that bulls have not yet challenged meaningfully. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning The recent bounce occurred with moderate participation, lacking the expansion typically associated with strong trend continuation. This suggests short covering and tactical buying rather than broad-based demand returning to the market. Structurally, Bitcoin appears to be forming a range between roughly $88,000 and $96,000. Holding above the lower bound would keep the consolidation intact, while a failure back below $88,000 would reopen downside risk toward the mid-$80,000s. For now, the price action reflects relief and stabilization, but confirmation of a sustainable uptrend still requires a decisive reclaim of higher resistance levels.

56848658,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258455,1767614412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"American Bitcoin’s Strategic 5,427 BTC Reserve Signals Major Institutional Confidence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/american-bitcoin-5427-btc-holdings/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld American Bitcoin’s Strategic 5,427 BTC Reserve Signals Major Institutional Confidence In a significant disclosure for the cryptocurrency sector, American Bitcoin (ABTC), the mining venture founded by Eric Trump, confirmed it holds a substantial reserve of 5,427 Bitcoin (BTC) as of January 2, 2025. This announcement, made from the company’s operational base, provides a rare and transparent look into the balance sheet of a prominent institutional miner. Consequently, it highlights the evolving strategy where mining firms are not just producers but also long-term custodians of digital value. The revelation arrives during a period of intense focus on Bitcoin’s role within traditional finance and corporate treasury management. American Bitcoin’s Substantial 5,427 BTC Treasury American Bitcoin’s (ABTC) confirmed holding of 5,427 BTC represents a major financial position within the cryptocurrency mining industry. Based on prevailing market valuations, this reserve translates to a digital asset treasury worth several hundred million dollars. The company, established by Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has positioned itself as a significant player in North America’s energy-intensive mining sector. Furthermore, this disclosure follows a trend among publicly traded miners to report their Bitcoin holdings transparently for investor clarity. The company likely accumulated these coins through a combination of block rewards and strategic market purchases. This practice, often called ‘HODLing,’ indicates a strong long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Many industry analysts view such reserves as a bullish signal for underlying network strength. The Strategic Rationale Behind Mining Reserves Mining companies like American Bitcoin face a fundamental strategic choice: sell mined Bitcoin for immediate operational capital or hold it as a treasury asset. Holding a large reserve, such as 5,427 BTC, suggests a specific corporate philosophy. Primarily, it acts as a hedge against fiat currency inflation and a bet on Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation. Additionally, these holdings can serve as collateral for securing low-interest debt or financing further infrastructure expansion. For instance, other major miners like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms have employed similar strategies with their sizable BTC treasuries. This approach transforms a mining operation from a pure commodity producer into a hybrid digital asset company. The decision reflects a deep integration of Bitcoin’s monetary properties into the firm’s core financial strategy. Therefore, ABTC’s reserve is not merely an inventory but a deliberate balance sheet optimization. Contextualizing the 5,427 BTC Figure To understand the scale of American Bitcoin’s 5,427 BTC holding, comparative analysis is essential. This reserve places ABTC among the top tier of private Bitcoin mining companies by treasury size, though still behind the largest public entities. For context, the entire Bitcoin network currently creates 900 new BTC every day through mining rewards. ABTC’s holdings represent the equivalent of roughly six days of total new global Bitcoin supply. When compared to corporate treasuries, this stash is significantly larger than the Bitcoin purchases made by several mainstream public companies in recent years. The holding also underscores the massive capital intensity and operational scale required for modern Bitcoin mining. It signals that ABTC has successfully navigated the industry’s volatility to amass and retain a valuable asset base. This achievement points to robust operational management and strategic financial discipline. Eric Trump’s Role and the Broader Industry Landscape Eric Trump’s founding of American Bitcoin situates the company within a notable political and business narrative. While the venture operates independently, its association brings heightened public and media scrutiny to its disclosures and performance. The mining industry itself has undergone a dramatic geographical shift, often called the ‘Great Mining Migration,’ with a significant portion of hash rate now located in North America. This shift prioritizes energy sourcing, regulatory compliance, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting. American Bitcoin’s operations are part of this broader trend toward institutionalization and professionalization. The company’s decision to publicly disclose its BTC holdings aligns with increasing demands for transparency from investors and regulators alike. Moreover, it demonstrates how cryptocurrency mining is maturing into a standardized sector of the global energy and technology industries. Implications for Market Perception and Volatility The public knowledge of large, illiquid holdings like American Bitcoin’s 5,427 BTC can influence market dynamics. Such reserves represent potential future supply, but their strategic ‘HODL’ status means they are unlikely to be sold on the open market impulsively. This reduces immediate selling pressure and can contribute to price stability. However, analysts closely monitor the spending habits of large holders, as any significant movement can signal strategic shifts. The disclosure also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the health and strategy of other private mining firms. For the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, substantial institutional holdings validate Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. They demonstrate that sophisticated operators are willing to allocate significant capital and retain exposure over extended periods. This institutional confidence can, in turn, influence investment decisions across the wider digital asset space. Regulatory and Accounting Considerations Holding 5,427 BTC as a corporate asset introduces complex regulatory and accounting challenges. In the United States, guidance from bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to evolve. Companies must choose whether to classify Bitcoin as an indefinite-lived intangible asset or under new fair-value accounting rules. This classification significantly impacts quarterly earnings reports, as impairment charges or mark-to-market gains create volatility in stated profits. American Bitcoin’s disclosure indicates it is navigating this complex landscape, likely with specialized legal and financial advisory. Furthermore, as a holder of a substantial cryptocurrency reserve, the company must implement enterprise-grade security protocols, including multi-signature wallets and custody solutions. These operational necessities underscore the maturity required to manage such a digital asset treasury effectively. Conclusion American Bitcoin’s confirmation of a 5,427 BTC treasury reserve marks a pivotal moment for institutional transparency in the cryptocurrency mining industry. This substantial holding, reported by the Eric Trump-founded venture, reflects a strategic commitment to Bitcoin’s long-term value and signifies the sector’s ongoing maturation. The move aligns with broader trends of corporate Bitcoin adoption, sophisticated treasury management, and the professionalization of digital asset operations. As regulatory frameworks solidify and market infrastructure develops, disclosures like this will become increasingly standard, providing clearer insights into the financial bedrock of the Bitcoin network. Ultimately, American Bitcoin’s reserve is a strong vote of confidence in the asset’s enduring role within the future of global finance. FAQs Q1: What is American Bitcoin (ABTC)? American Bitcoin (ABTC) is a cryptocurrency mining company founded by Eric Trump. It focuses on securing the Bitcoin network through computational power and has now disclosed holding 5,427 BTC as a strategic treasury asset. Q2: Why is the 5,427 BTC holding significant? The holding is significant because it represents a multi-hundred-million-dollar asset reserve on the company’s balance sheet. It indicates a long-term investment strategy in Bitcoin and places ABTC among the larger private entities in the mining sector by treasury size. Q3: How do mining companies typically use their Bitcoin reserves? Mining companies may use Bitcoin reserves as a long-term store of value, collateral for securing loans to fund expansion, or to cover operational expenses during market downturns without selling equity. The strategy depends on their financial outlook and market conditions. Q4: Does Eric Trump’s involvement affect the company’s operations? While Eric Trump is the founder, American Bitcoin operates as a separate business entity. His involvement brings public attention, but the company’s strategy and disclosures are likely driven by standard industry practices and financial considerations. Q5: What does this mean for the average Bitcoin investor? For the average investor, large institutional holdings like this can be seen as a sign of confidence, potentially reducing circulating supply and supporting long-term price stability. It also demonstrates the growing integration of Bitcoin into traditional corporate finance models.

The rebound suggests that demand has not fully disappeared, yet the broader technical picture remains unresolved. Despite the recent strength, BTC is still trading below key structural levels that would normally confirm a sustained continuation of the broader uptrend, keeping market participants cautious about calling a definitive trend shift. Adding complexity to the outlook, a recent CryptoQuant report by CryptoOnchain highlights a notable divergence in Binance flow data that deserves attention. The analysis compares the average size of Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on the exchange since October and points to a growing imbalance beneath the surface. On one side, the average inflow size has increased sharply, implying that larger holders are moving more BTC onto exchanges. On the other, average outflows remain subdued, signaling weaker accumulation behavior and limited movement into long-term storage. This divergence introduces a potential headwind for price, as it suggests that selling capacity is building faster than conviction to hold. While price action has improved in the short term, on-chain flows indicate that the market may still be vulnerable if demand fails to strengthen further. Bitcoin Whale Flows Signal Rising Supply Risk The report points to a meaningful shift in how large Bitcoin holders are interacting with exchanges, and the change is not neutral. Data tracking the average size of deposits into Binance shows a sharp jump over recent months. Transactions flowing into the exchange are no longer clustered around smaller sizes; instead, they increasingly reflect much larger transfers. This pattern is typically associated with whales positioning liquidity, a behavior that often precedes distribution rather than long-term holding. When large amounts of BTC are moved onto exchanges, it raises the probability that supply will soon be available to the market. At the same time, the opposite side of the equation looks notably weak. Average withdrawal sizes have failed to recover meaningfully since their decline in October. While there has been a modest rebound, outflows remain far below previous levels, suggesting that large investors are not aggressively moving coins into cold storage. This lack of follow-through on withdrawals implies muted conviction in longer-term accumulation. Taken together, these two trends form an uncomfortable divergence. Selling capacity appears to be growing, while evidence of strategic accumulation remains limited. This does not guarantee immediate downside, but it does tilt the risk profile against sustained upside momentum. As long as large inflows dominate and outflows stay suppressed, Bitcoin may struggle to build a durable rally without a clear improvement in underlying demand. Price Stabilizes, But Structural Resistance Persists Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after a sharp correction, but still facing important structural hurdles. Price has reclaimed the $92,000 area, which places BTC back above a key horizontal level that previously acted as support during mid-2025. This recovery has eased immediate downside pressure and suggests buyers are defending the range rather than capitulating. However, the broader trend remains mixed. Bitcoin is still trading below the declining short-term moving average, which has capped upside attempts since the November breakdown. This indicates that, despite the bounce, momentum has not fully shifted back in favor of bulls. The recovery so far resembles consolidation after a drawdown rather than a confirmed trend reversal. From a structural perspective, the rising longer-term moving averages remain intact and well below the price. This signals that the macro uptrend from 2023 has not been invalidated. As long as BTC holds above the green moving average, the larger bullish structure remains technically preserved. That said, the distance between price and these longer-term supports has narrowed, reflecting reduced trend strength. Volume has remained relatively muted during the rebound, suggesting that buying interest is cautious rather than aggressive. For Bitcoin to reassert bullish control, it would need to reclaim and hold above the short-term moving average with expanding volume. Until then, price action points to a fragile recovery within a broader consolidation phase.

As highlighted by leading on-chain metrics provider Coin Bureau, this development potentially brings Bitcoin into the hands of over 150 million Walmart customers, marking one of the most significant real-world use cases for cryptocurrency payments to date. Walmart’s integration of Bitcoin payments signals a major shift in how global retailers are approaching digital assets. Rather than treating crypto as a speculative asset on the sidelines, Walmart is positioning Bitcoin as a practical payment option for everyday transactions, groceries, household goods, and essential items used by millions of people daily. This move bridges the long-standing gap between crypto innovation and real-world commerce. OnePay Cash is a strategic on-ramp. By embedding Bitcoin payments into Walmart’s own financial ecosystem, the retailer removes friction for customers unfamiliar with crypto wallets or exchanges, enabling simple, intuitive BTC payments. This move normalizes Bitcoin as a seamless everyday payment method, arriving as whale accumulation signals growing institutional confidence. Walmart’s Bitcoin move could ripple far beyond its stores. As a retail giant, its adoption sets a precedent, if Bitcoin payments prove efficient and user-friendly, other major retailers may follow, accelerating crypto acceptance across retail, e-commerce, and financial services. Rising retail sentiment and adoption of Bitcoin could boost transaction volumes, liquidity, and network effects. While scalability and fees remain debated, major integrations like Walmart’s drive innovation and strengthen infrastructure. For Bitcoin, Walmart’s checkout integration is a major stride toward its original vision as peer-to-peer digital cash. By reaching 150 million shoppers, Bitcoin moves beyond ‘digital gold’ into everyday use. In a world where traditional finance and crypto increasingly converge, this move signals that digital assets are no longer on the sidelines, they’re entering mainstream commerce. Conclusion Walmart’s move to accept Bitcoin is a landmark for mainstream crypto adoption. By enabling seamless transactions for 150 million customers, it turns Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a practical payment tool. Therefore, this move sets a global precedent, showing that the future of commerce is digital, fast, and borderless, positioning Walmart at the forefront of a new era in everyday spending.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56853933,653642,1767625207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56853933.jpeg,This Bitcoin Metric Shows That Inflows To Binance Skew Heavily Toward Whales,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-inflows-skew-toward-whales/,bitcoinist,"The broader cryptocurrency market seems to be slowly turning bullish, with the price of Bitcoin reclaiming the $92,000 mark after weeks of trading beneath the level. Despite a rebound, a key metric shows that massive BTC inflows to the Binance exchange have not yet slowed down as whale activity heats up. Whale-Sized Bitcoin Inflows Hit Binance While the market is regaining upside traction, Bitcoin is experiencing a persistent and notable shift in exchange activity. In a CryptoQuant quicktake , Maartunn, a market expert and investor, has outlined a steady uptick in flows to Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and there are increasingly whale-sized transfers. Typically, such movement of BTC raises questions about a potential sell-off , strategic positioning, or preparing for volatility. However, considering the current market state, these major players may be gearing up for the market’s next phase rather than sitting on the sidelines. Maartunn determined the shift in exchange activity after examining the Bitcoin Inflow Mean metric on the monthly time frame. The key metric shows the average BTC per inflow transaction, which is signaling that larger holders are now more active on the Binance crypto exchange. As seen in the chart, the Monthly Inflow Mean to Binance increased to 21.7 BTC in December 2025. It is worth noting that the metric has been rising in the last 2 years, moving from 0.86 BTC in early January 2024 to 21.7 BTC in 2026. To put into context, this growth represents a 34x increase in the average size of each deposit. Maartunn highlighted that this trend started accelerating in early 2024, just around the period the Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC). The timing suggests that larger organizations may have begun using Binance as an exchange alongside institutional adoption. However, this could just be a coincidence. As a result of the persistent inflow to Binance from large holders, the expert declares that the crypto exchange is poisoning itself as a key venue for whale flows. BTC Purchase Firing Up Among Large Holders Bitcoin accumulation among large holders or whales has also increased sharply lately. NoLimit, the analyst who predicted the Bitcoin bottom at $16,000 and its top at $126,000 in October 2025, reported that the cohort scooped up around 270,000 BTC, valued at roughly $23 billion over the past 30 days. This represents 1.3% of BTC’s total supply, and it is the largest net purchase from the investors in the last 13 years. A key development in this buying activity is the period during which it is being conducted. Historically, this kind of whale concentration has occurred during uncertain times rather than at clear tops. While most individuals are preoccupied with other things and aren’t paying attention to inflows, this type of placement takes place quietly. NoLimit stated that this does not mean that BTC gets to move upward tomorrow, but it does imply that investors with the longest time horizons are aggressively increasing their exposure. Meanwhile, investors in shitcoins are complaining about the coins not moving upward.",Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|Bitcoin Inflow Mean|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant Maartunn|ETFs|NoLimit|Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

As issuance declines and liquidity thins, a growing share of the BTC circulating supply has been moving into the hands of powerful financial institutions, resulting in a steady accumulation that reshapes the dynamics of the BTC market, liquidity, and long-term distribution. Does Institutional Adoption Change Bitcoin’s Purpose? The financial-industrial complex is in the process of centralizing as much Bitcoin as possible. Crypto investor Simon Dixon has revealed on X that institutions want to accumulate BTC as a useful tool for managing the final capital outflow squeeze once it is ready, following its Western asset-stripping operations. Related Reading: Why The 2025 Close Below $100,000 Is Terrible For The Bitcoin Price As BTC is a proof-of-work, accumulating it does not grant governance control or long-term price discovery. However, the accumulation does provide the tools needed to manage short-term price action. Institutions are in the accumulation phase, and they want self-custody for themselves and institutional custody for everybody else. Therefore, they can channel large capital flows into BTC while preserving an exit tool for sovereign wealth. This is similar to how the British Empire utilized tax haven islands as escape valves. According to Simon, BTC is one of their exit strategies for managing sovereign wealth in a world where custody of vast gold reserves requires trusted custodians. Nothing has changed in terms of how to prepare, and the strategy remains to own more BTC in self-custody this month than the previous month. Any price suppression now is an opportunity; it won’t last. Furthermore, the financial-industrial complex will engineer volatility through instruments like MicroStrategy and its derivatives ecosystem to margin-call as much BTC as possible while building more leverage tools. This isn’t about crypto, but a Silicon Valley liquidity grift, which is a way to supplement VC returns with added liquidity layered on top of private equity. Crypto is a technical industrial complex operation to build out the digital control grid. Why Bitcoin As A Financial Lifeboat The lesson of Venezuela is the best advertisement for Bitcoin ever created. Investor Fred Krueger noted that those who still had Bolivars in 2016 when hyperinflation began had a clear chance to accumulate BTC when it was trading below $1,000. Instead, they lost absolutely everything.

That altcoin that represented oil was limited and was shelved in 2024. This is the lesson for the BRICS. “Maduro and his inner circle probably owned very little BTC, believing they would remain in power forever, but a lot of them are regretting that today,” Fred noted.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin and Ether broke out of their December ranges as risk-on sentiment returned across global markets. QCP sees the move as a potential regime shift, aided by fading tax-loss selling and renewed policy optionality. Options markets turned more constructive, though positioning remains cautious despite rising upside demand. The move came alongside firmer global equities and softer oil prices, pointing to a broader return of risk appetite at the start of the year, according to QCP’s latest Asia Colour note . QCP: Crypto Rally Signals Regime Shift as Risk Appetite Returns QCP said the rally looks increasingly like a shift in market regime rather than a short-lived bounce. The fading impact of year-end tax-loss selling has removed a key drag on prices, while renewed policy optionality has returned to investor focus. In that context, crypto’s strength appears more closely aligned with traditional risk assets than it did late last year. Geopolitical headlines also fed into the narrative. Markets were digesting news of a US special forces operation that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who is now expected to face proceedings in the United States. QCP noted that lower oil prices could add a disinflationary tailwind, while speculation around seized digital assets has fueled talk of a potential “shadow” Bitcoin reserve. The firm cautioned against treating such claims as fact, but said the idea reinforces an existing theme of sovereign interest in crypto holdings. Morning Market Update Is this bounce a post–options-expiry effect, or the start of a broader leg higher? Markets closed last Friday with positive momentum, which extended through the weekend in crypto and into the European open. Risk sentiment remains constructive. European… pic.twitter.com/N133t7fsYW — Nick The Greek (@Nikos_Np1910) January 5, 2026 Derivatives markets have turned more supportive. QCP observed that put skew has compressed, signaling reduced demand for downside protection, while interest has grown in longer-dated upside exposure, including January 2026 $100,000 Bitcoin calls. Demand for topside structures such as straddles has also picked up. Still, QCP warned that positioning remains measured. “A continued spot grind higher raises the odds of a gamma-assisted extension, though recent U.S. sessions have faded rallies often enough to keep positioning disciplined,” the firm said. Whale Inflows to Binance Rise as Buying Power Stalls, Analysts Warn Large crypto holders moved roughly $2.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ether onto Binance over the past week, marking the exchange’s largest net inflow in about a month. On-chain data cited by CryptoOnchain shows deposits were split almost evenly between the two assets, a pattern often linked to preparation for selling or the use of assets as derivatives collateral. Analysts highlighted a key imbalance behind the inflows. Stablecoin movements remained largely flat at around $42 million for the week, with most activity reflecting transfers between blockchains rather than new capital entering the market. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions. Barhydt said the US central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt.

According to data verified by CoinDesk, the average daily volume surged to 278,000 contracts, representing a staggering $12 billion in notional value. This milestone underscores a decisive move by traditional finance into the digital asset space through regulated, familiar channels. Consequently, the growth trajectory signals a maturing market infrastructure that appeals to major financial players. CME Crypto Derivatives Volume Reaches Historic $12 Billion Peak The reported $12 billion average daily volume for CME’s crypto derivatives in 2025 marks a definitive chapter in market evolution. Specifically, this figure represents the notional value of contracts traded, providing a clear metric for institutional engagement. Furthermore, the exchange confirmed that cryptocurrencies were a major contributor to its overall record performance. Across all asset classes, CME’s average daily volume hit 28.1 million contracts. This parallel growth highlights how digital assets are becoming integrated into broader financial portfolios rather than operating in isolation. Analysts point to several structural factors behind this surge. Primarily, the increased clarity in global regulatory frameworks by 2025 has provided institutions with the confidence to allocate significant capital. Additionally, the development of more sophisticated risk management tools within regulated exchanges has reduced entry barriers. The volume spike is not an isolated event but part of a consistent, upward trend observed since the introduction of these products. Market participants now view regulated crypto derivatives as a core component of a diversified trading strategy. Micro Contracts Fuel Unprecedented Institutional Adoption CME explicitly credited the record performance to its Micro Bitcoin and Micro Ether futures contracts. These smaller, more accessible contracts have acted as a critical gateway. Designed to represent a fraction of a single Bitcoin or Ether, they allow institutions to hedge exposure or gain market access with lower capital requirements and reduced risk. Therefore, their popularity demonstrates a strategic, scaled approach to market entry by pension funds, asset managers, and corporate treasuries. Micro Bitcoin Futures (MBT): Each contract represents 0.1 Bitcoin, enabling precise position sizing. Micro Ether Futures (MET): Each contract represents 0.1 Ether, catering to the growing Ethereum ecosystem. Lower Margin Requirements: Reduced capital outlay lowers the barrier for institutional testing and strategy deployment. Enhanced Liquidity: High trading volume in these micro contracts improves overall market depth and price stability. The success of these products reflects a deliberate shift in institutional behavior. Initially, large players were hesitant to engage with the volatility and custody challenges of spot markets. Now, they utilize these regulated futures for exposure, hedging, and arbitrage. This activity, in turn, creates a more robust and liquid market that benefits all participants. Expert Analysis: The Road to $12 Billion Market historians and analysts contextualize this 2025 record within a longer timeline. CME launched its standard Bitcoin futures in December 2017, a move widely seen as a landmark event for institutional legitimacy. The subsequent introduction of Micro Bitcoin futures in May 2021 and Micro Ether futures in December 2021 laid the foundational infrastructure for the current boom. Each product launch addressed specific institutional concerns about contract size and accessibility. Evidence from CME’s published Commitments of Traders (COT) reports throughout 2024 and early 2025 shows a steady increase in positions held by “asset managers” and “leveraged funds,” categories synonymous with institutional money. This data provides verifiable proof of the trend beyond just volume metrics. The growth correlates strongly with macroeconomic conditions, including inflation hedging demands and the maturation of crypto-native financial services like institutional custody. The record volume is a lagging indicator of years of infrastructure development and regulatory dialogue. Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The ripple effects of $12 billion in daily derivatives volume on a regulated exchange are profound. First, it establishes a trusted, transparent price discovery mechanism that influences global spot markets. Prices on CME are often referenced as a benchmark for institutional over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Second, the liquidity allows for more effective hedging, enabling businesses operating in the crypto space to manage volatility risk confidently. This stability can encourage further innovation and investment in blockchain technology. Moreover, the activity legitimizes cryptocurrency as an asset class in the eyes of conservative investors and regulators. When a 150-year-old institution like CME reports record crypto volumes, it commands attention from traditional media and policymaking circles. This validation effect can accelerate the development of related financial products, such as crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and structured notes. The market is moving from a speculative frontier to a integrated component of global finance. Conclusion The record $12 billion CME crypto derivatives volume in 2025 represents a pivotal moment of convergence between traditional finance and digital assets. Driven by the strategic success of Micro Bitcoin and Ether futures, this milestone highlights deep institutional adoption through regulated avenues. The data confirms a maturation of market structure, providing liquidity, price discovery, and risk management tools essential for long-term growth. Ultimately, this trend solidifies cryptocurrency’s position within the institutional portfolio and sets a new baseline for the future of finance. FAQs Q1: What are CME crypto derivatives? A1: They are standardized futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that derive their value from underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They allow traders to speculate on future prices or hedge existing exposures in a regulated environment. Q2: Why is the $12 billion volume in 2025 significant? A2: This record volume is significant because it signals massive institutional participation. It demonstrates that major financial players are using regulated exchanges to manage crypto exposure, lending credibility and liquidity to the entire asset class. Q3: How do Micro futures differ from standard futures? A3: Micro Bitcoin and Micro Ether futures represent 0.1 of the underlying asset, whereas standard contracts represent larger amounts (e.g., 5 Bitcoin). Micro contracts require less capital, making them accessible for testing strategies and hedging smaller positions with precision. Q4: Does high derivatives volume impact Bitcoin’s spot price? A4: Yes, it can. A highly liquid derivatives market on a major exchange like CME contributes to price discovery and can influence spot prices globally. It also allows large players to execute trades without immediately moving the spot market drastically. Q5: What does this mean for the average cryptocurrency investor? A5: For average investors, this institutional adoption through regulated venues like CME can lead to a more stable and mature market over time. It reduces extreme volatility driven purely by retail sentiment and integrates crypto into the global financial system, potentially leading to wider acceptance and new investment products.

This trend emerges concurrently with a stark drop in mining profitability, creating a complex and pivotal moment for the industry’s infrastructure. Consequently, market observers are analyzing the broader implications for network security, miner economics, and the valuation of publicly traded mining firms. Bitcoin Hashrate Decline Signals Market Shift According to a recent report from banking giant JPMorgan, cited by CoinDesk, the Bitcoin network’s total computational power, known as the hashrate, fell for two consecutive months through December. This metric, measured in exahashes per second (EH/s), serves as a critical barometer for miner activity and network security. Essentially, a declining hashrate suggests that fewer machines are actively solving the complex mathematical problems required to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. Therefore, this trend points directly to a reduction in the intense competition that has characterized Bitcoin mining in recent years. Historically, the Bitcoin hashrate has demonstrated a strong upward trajectory, often correlating with price increases and technological advancements in mining hardware. For instance, the network’s hashrate soared following previous market cycles, as miners deployed more efficient Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) rigs. However, the current reversal indicates a potential market recalibration. Several factors could drive this shift, including decreased mining profitability, increased operational costs, and the natural attrition of less efficient hardware after the Bitcoin halving event in 2024. Mining Profitability Hits Record Lows Parallel to the hashrate decline, JPMorgan’s analysis highlights a severe contraction in mining profitability. Specifically, the report notes that the block reward revenue per exahash per second plummeted by 32% year-over-year, reaching an all-time low. Gross profits for miners also decreased significantly during this period. This profitability squeeze stems from a combination of static block rewards, increased network difficulty adjustments in the preceding quarters, and volatile energy costs. The following table illustrates the core profitability metrics highlighted in the report: Metric Change Impact Block Reward Revenue per EH/s -32% YoY All-time low Gross Mining Profit Significant Decrease Pressure on operational margins Network Hashrate 2-month decline Reduced competition This environment creates a high-pressure scenario for mining operations. Miners with access to cheap, stable energy sources and the latest generation hardware are more likely to endure the downturn. Conversely, operations with higher costs face potential shutdowns, which in turn contributes to the observed hashrate decline. This dynamic represents a natural consolidation phase within the industry. Expert Analysis on Miner Economics Financial analysts and blockchain experts often view these metrics as interconnected. The falling hashrate can temporarily reduce the network difficulty, potentially improving margins for the remaining miners. However, if the Bitcoin price does not appreciate sufficiently, the relief may be short-lived. JPMorgan’s report provides a data-driven snapshot of this inflection point. Furthermore, institutional analysis from firms like JPMorgan adds a layer of traditional finance scrutiny to the crypto mining sector, influencing investor perception and market sentiment. Public Mining Stocks Defy Core Metrics In a seemingly contradictory market movement, the stock prices of U.S.-listed Bitcoin mining companies and related data center operators experienced robust gains last year. JPMorgan noted that the market capitalization of these themed stocks surged by approximately 73%. This divergence between operational fundamentals and equity valuation invites closer examination. Several factors may explain this disparity: Market Anticipation: Investors may be pricing in future Bitcoin price appreciation or technological breakthroughs. Corporate Strategy: Public miners have diversified into high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) data hosting, reducing reliance purely on Bitcoin rewards. Industry Consolidation: The profitability crisis could lead to mergers, benefiting larger, well-capitalized public entities. Macro Sentiment: Broader risk-on sentiment in financial markets often lifts crypto-correlated stocks. This trend underscores that public market investors are evaluating mining firms not solely as Bitcoin producers but as technology and infrastructure plays with multiple potential revenue streams. Conclusion The dual trends of a declining Bitcoin hashrate and record-low mining profitability, as reported by JPMorgan, mark a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency’s foundational industry. While easing miner competition may offer marginal relief to surviving operations, the severe profitability plunge necessitates efficient scale and strategic diversification. The remarkable resilience of public mining stocks further complicates the narrative, suggesting investor focus on long-term potential over short-term metrics. Ultimately, this period of adjustment will test the sustainability of mining operations and likely drive further consolidation, shaping the network’s security and decentralization for the future. FAQs Q1: What is Bitcoin hashrate? The Bitcoin hashrate is the total combined computational power used by miners to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. It is a measure of how many calculations per second the network can perform. Q2: Why does a falling hashrate ease miner competition? A lower hashrate means there is less total computational power competing to solve the next block. This increases the statistical chance for each remaining mining unit to earn the block reward, effectively reducing competition. Q3: What causes Bitcoin mining profitability to fall? Profitability falls due to a combination of factors: a static or reduced Bitcoin block reward (post-halving), increases in the network’s mining difficulty, rising energy and operational costs, and a decline in the Bitcoin price relative to costs. Q4: How can mining stocks rise while profitability falls? Public mining stocks are influenced by broader market sentiment, future Bitcoin price expectations, diversification into other tech sectors like AI, and the potential for industry consolidation where larger public companies acquire struggling private ones. Q5: Does a lower hashrate make the Bitcoin network less secure? Potentially, yes. A significantly lower hashrate reduces the computational cost required to attempt a 51% attack. However, the current decline is viewed by analysts as a market adjustment rather than a critical security threat, and the network difficulty adjusts periodically to reflect the available hashrate.

Interestingly, this has been the longest winning streak since early October, as it briefly touched $93,000. While BTC has defeated short-term bears, a liquidity crisis may still trigger a sharp crash, according to market experts. Bitcoin Breaks the “Silver Line” Crypto analyst Doctor Profit identified that Bitcoin has, for the first time in a month, broken above what he calls the “Silver Line.” This is a short-term resistance level that had rejected price advances five times previously. In a detailed weekend report, the analyst said that this breakout was followed by a clear retest and bullish confirmation, which he interprets as BTC defeating short-term bearish pressure and signaling readiness for a further move higher. Doctor Profit found that this development aligns with his expectations over the past two months. After Bitcoin reached his earlier target of $80,000, he stated that upside levels between $97,000 and $107,000 were still possible before any continuation of a broader downside trend. He reiterated that he began buying BTC around $85,000, with the intention of selling those holdings within the $97,000 to $107,000 range. Based on current price action, he said the market now appears to be attempting this move. As such, Doctor Profit explained that he is placing multiple short orders across the $97,000-$107,000 zone and described the strategy as dividing trading capital into multiple parts to place staggered short positions. The main aim is to achieve the best possible average entry price. He also said he is keeping earlier short positions from the $115,000-$125,000 range fully open, in case the market moves to those higher levels. Despite acknowledging the near-term upside, the analyst asserted that he remains fully bearish on Bitcoin overall and continues to target prices below $70,000 in the coming months. He cited macroeconomic factors as crucial support for this view. One major concern highlighted was the Federal Reserve’s $106 billion in overnight repo lending to banks on New Year’s Day. He pointed to changes made to repo lending rules in September 2025, which increased potential liquidity access for individual banks, and called this a sign of deeper financial system stress. Doctor Profit also said historical patterns show that periods of banking stress and liquidity shortages have often coincided with bear markets. He added that insider selling, pressure on banks, and stress linked to silver markets further reinforce his bearish outlook. Bigger Risk Ahead? Market commentator Mr Wall Street also echoed a similar concern as he tweeted that BTC faces downside risk despite a possible short-term rally amidst geopolitical tensions involving Venezuela and macroeconomic stress. In his latest breakdown, he argued that markets are beginning to price in the risk of a broader global shock, which could pressure risk assets, including BTC. While he expects a near-term relief rally designed to build liquidity, this move is likely temporary.

According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin has recorded a weekly surge of 7%, while Ethereum and Solana have outperformed the leading cryptocurrency with increases of nearly 9% during the same period. Notably, XRP has taken the lead, boasting a significant 15% uptrend. Large Holders Drive Bitcoin Surge A key driver behind this recent surge, especially for Bitcoin, can be attributed to large holders, or “whales,” who have acquired approximately 270,000 BTC in the last 30 days, amounting to roughly $23 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Brink Of A 9,000% Rally To $10? What Historical Performance Shows Market analyst NoLimit highlighted this crucial development in a recent social media post, noting its significance: this accumulation represents 1.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply and marks the largest net buy from this group in 13 years. However, NoLimit asserts that this doesn’t imply that Bitcoin will see an immediate surge in its value. It indicates that long-term investors are aggressively positioning themselves even while the broader market sentiment remains mixed. Will BTC Establish A Macro Lower High? In the short term, though, market analyst Rekt Capital warns that despite Bitcoin hovering just above $93,400, it has closed its 12-month candle below the $93,500 mark. This suggests that the $93,500 level is likely to act as resistance moving forward. Historical patterns across four-year cycles indicate that such resistances can hinder price movement for an extended period, often resisting for up to three years before being breached in the next Halving year. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows Should Bitcoin indeed be in the early stages of a bear market, this could imply that prices might surpass the $93,500 resistance in the coming months only to establish a macro lower high before continuing their downward trajectory.

So would a $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at the start of 2025 have been worth it? BTC went into 2025 on a somewhat solid footing but ended up struggling throughout the first quarter. It eventually rebounded over the summer and reached new all-time highs above $126,000 in October, but it soon went on another downward trend. The fourth quarter’s sharp reversal was the most damaging, dragging the full-year Bitcoin price firmly into negative territory. Accordingly, investing $1,000 in Bitcoin at the start of 2025 would have resulted in a somewhat unremarkable outcome by the time of writing, January 5, 2026. How much would a $1,000 Bitcoin investment at the start of 2025 be worth now? Namely, at press time, BTC was trading at $92,640, down 5.82% on the yearly chart. One-year Bitcoin price chart. Source: Finbold Exactly a year ago, on January 5, 2025, the flagship crypto was changing hands at $98,000. In other words, a hypothetical $1,000 Bitcoin investment a year ago would now be worth approximately $945. Had you invested four days earlier, on January 1, 2025, when Bitcoin was priced at $94,930, you would now have around $975. On New Year’s Eve 2025, for comparison, that same investment would have been worth $923. Comparing these scenarios, although they are all negative, it becomes evident how seemingly irrelevant timing discrepancies can influence long-term outcomes with such an asset, especially in a year as volatile as for markets as 2025.

Institutional interest , market psychology, and structural growth are key drivers behind these shifts. XRP, a major utility-focused digital asset, now sits at a critical junction where these forces could combine to create significant upside potential. Crypto analyst Mason Versluis recently highlighted this perspective in a post on X. He explained that Bitcoin’s potential rise to a $5 trillion to $10 trillion market capitalization could normalize XRP reaching a $1.8 trillion market cap. In such a scenario, XRP’s growth would feel natural to investors, reinforcing the broader bullish outlook for altcoins. How Bitcoin’s Growth Shapes XRP’s Bullish Outlook Versluis emphasized that altcoins, including XRP , often follow Bitcoin’s market trajectory. Large-scale institutional investment and billionaire participation in Bitcoin could drive liquidity into the broader crypto market, supporting XRP’s upward momentum. This is the single most bullish $XRP photo you’ll see this week. Why? Because I’m bullish on Bitcoin to get to $5T – $10T, and so are huge institutions + billionaires. Why does that matter for XRP? Well if $BTC goes that high, then it’s not weird or psychologically a problem,… pic.twitter.com/pf0SAm7fT1 — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) January 4, 2026 As Bitcoin scales to multi-trillion-dollar valuations, investors are likely to rotate capital into fundamentally strong altcoins, making XRP a key beneficiary of this structural flow. The Power of Market Psychology Investor sentiment plays a pivotal role in cryptocurrency adoption. According to Versluis, once market caps reach previously unimaginable levels, what once felt extreme becomes normalized. If Bitcoin achieves a $5 trillion to $10 trillion market cap, XRP at $1.8 trillion would appear reasonable rather than extraordinary. This psychological shift reduces resistance to higher valuations, positioning XRP for potential accelerated growth. Altcoins Set to Benefit A bullish environment for XRP could also extend to other well-structured altcoins. Versluis notes that projects with strong fundamentals, committed dev teams, and active ecosystems will likely capture investor attention. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Conversely, tokens with weak governance or minimal adoption risk stagnation highlight the importance of quality projects in a growing crypto market. Beyond Predictions: Probability in Action Versluis’ analysis shows XRP’s potential is not rooted in speculation but probability. Past Bitcoin milestones, such as surpassing $1 billion in market cap, once seemed improbable but became reality as adoption accelerated. Similarly, XRP’s current trajectory may appear modest today but could reflect significant upside if structural, institutional, and psychological factors align. As XRP navigates this evolving landscape, the interplay between Bitcoin’s market expansion, institutional inflows, and investor sentiment could create an environment where historically ambitious valuations become achievable. For traders and investors, understanding this dynamic is crucial to assessing XRP’s long-term growth potential in the broader crypto ecosystem.

The BOJ’s next move depends on the economic conditions in the country. The comments come two weeks after the BOJ lifted rates to their highest level in 30 years. The Bank of Japan hiked interest rates to 0.75% as reported by Cryptopolitan. Japan bond yields continue to climb According to Ueda, the Japanese central bank is not done normalizing policy, even after pushing rates to their highest level since the mid-1990s. Yields on Japan’s 10-year government bonds extended recent gains. The benchmark yield rose to around 2.075% after adding 2 basis points. The yield gained 1% basis point over 2025. The recorded levels were last seen in 1999 as investors priced in further hikes. Ueda revealed his plans while speaking with private sector bankers. During the first public meeting for 2026, the governor stated that policy tightening would continue as economic activity and inflation strengthen. “We will keep raising rates in line with improvement in the economy and inflation,” Ueda said today. He added that carefully scaling back monetary easing would help secure stable inflation while supporting sustained economic growth. He continued , “The appropriate adjustment of monetary easing will lead to the achievement of a stable inflation target and longer-term economic growth.” Ueda said the relationship between steady wage gains and moderate inflation is likely to hold. Is the yen carry trade shrinking? The size of the yen carry trade is unclear to most people. Some companies place the size of the yen carry trade above $20 trillion. A huge number in the $20 trillion range induces fear among investors, leading to a scenario of forced selling and a global market shock. However, those numbers are not credible. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) tracks “cross-border financing on a quarterly basis.” According to the BIS, the yen carry trade is above 41 trillion yen, or $261 billion. The trade expanded between 2021 and 2023, but growth has since stalled. Recent data shows a flat year-over-year (y-o-y) change. Investors are gradually unwinding rather than rushing to exit. Total yen cross-border and foreign-currency credit to non-bank borrowers outside Japan, in terms of loans and deposits. Source: The Bank for International Settlements (BIS ). US Treasury yields and Japanese bond yields move together. The incentive to hold the yen carry trade weakens naturally. Simultaneously, euro-based carry trades are beginning to attract investors. The reason is that cross-border euro lending is at a record high, according to SeekingAlpha analysts . The $261 billion is not extreme. It is far smaller compared to the $1.2 trillion margin balance in US equity markets. It is also lower than the rise in margin debt of $360 billion recorded since Liberation Day (tariffs) . The closing gap between US and Japanese interest rates is pressuring the yen carry trade. But new economic data suggests that pressure may be stabilizing. Japan’s real GDP fell 2.3% and inflation dropped from about 4% to under 3%. Unemployment is low but near the top of its recent range. These signs indicate slower growth and cooling inflation. This may lead the BOJ to take a neutral stance in 2026 instead of tightening further. The bigger concern might be US Treasuries. Japan currently holds the largest amount of foreign debt. It has over $1.2 trillion in US government debt. Japanese Treasury holdings have been largely flat for over a decade. That suggests the yen carry trade has not really driven these investments. Still, changes in leveraged domestic positions or funding behavior could affect Treasury markets. Bitcoin swings between $90k and $94k At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $93,163.13 based on CoinGecko’s aggregated data . The coin is trying to recover and push past the $95,000 price point. In the past seven days, Bitcoin’s price increased by 6.2%, and in the 30-day time frame, it jumped only 3.2%. However, the 90-day timeline is still in the red. Since the release of the rate cut plans in Japan, Bitcoin hasn’t reacted violently. In fact, the price jumped by 2.2% in the last 24 hours.

Developer activity across the Bitcoin Core ecosystem has jumped sharply, reversing a multi-year slowdown and reigniting long-term confidence as BTC trades near $94,000. According to data compiled by Casa CSO Jameson Lopp, Bitcoin Core development activity rose meaningfully throughout 2025, a shift that historically tends to precede structural market moves rather than short-term speculation. Bitcoin Development Activity Sends a Signal For the first time in years, Bitcoin’s technical heartbeat is accelerating rather than fading. Email traffic on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List surged 60% year over year, while 135 unique contributors pushed roughly 285,000 lines of code in 2025.

Bitcoin Core still powers nearly 78% of all full nodes, making it the backbone of the network. Rising developer engagement often reflects deeper conversations around scalability, security, and protocol efficiency rather than hype-driven upgrades. In November, Bitcoin Core also completed its first public third-party security audit, which found no critical vulnerabilities, further reinforcing institutional confidence. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Structure Shows Momentum Rebuilding On the daily chart, Bitcoin price prediction has turned bullish as BTC is emerging from a steep corrective phase that began after rejection near the $114,000–$115,000 zone. Price found a firm base around $80,500, forming a descending channel that has since evolved into a broad falling wedge, a pattern that often resolves higher once selling pressure fades. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin has reclaimed the 0.382 Fibonacci level near $90,800 and is now pressing into the $94,000–$97,000 congestion zone, where the 20-day and 50-day EMAs are beginning to curl higher. A bullish EMA crossover is attempting to form, while RSI has rebounded above 60, signaling strengthening momentum without overheating. BTC/USD Key Levels and the Breakout Path Ahead On the daily price chart, a clean close above $97,000 would likely trigger follow-through toward the $101,000–$105,000 region, where prior support and moving-average resistance converge. Beyond that: $110,000 becomes the next psychological test A sustained base could reopen the path toward prior highs From a tactical perspective, shallow pullbacks into the $92,000–$94,000 range continue to attract buyers, while downside risk remains defined below $88,500. As developer momentum rebuilds and technical structure stabilizes, Bitcoin appears less focused on short-term volatility and more aligned with its next structural advance. If this trend holds, six-figure prices may once again shift from speculation to expectation as the next leg unfolds. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum also up, it appears the psychologically significant $1,000 mark could be attractive to bulls. BNB price hovered near $905 at the time of writing, having posted intraday gains between $885 and $907. The token’s price may benefit from broader market conditions as well as strong ecosystem fundamentals . Fermi is a major network upgrade coming in the next few days. Fermi hard fork targets faster blocks An upcoming network upgrade could provide near-term support for BNB price action, with the Fermi hard fork scheduled to go live on the BNB Smart Chain mainnet on January 14, 2026. According to the latest details, the Fermi upgrade marks one of the most significant technical changes to the network in recent years. A key feature of the hard fork is a reduction in block times to 450 milliseconds from 750 milliseconds, a shift aimed at improving transaction throughput and confirmation speeds. The shorter block times are expected to enhance overall network performance, with potential benefits for decentralized finance activity, including faster and more efficient trading on BNB Smart Chain–based protocols. “This upgrade brings faster confirmations across the network. Validators and builders should complete the required upgrades before activation,” the BNB Chain Developers wrote on X. Additional enhancements will include optimised execution efficiency and a refined consensus mechanism. BNB Chain is also eyeing a lightweight indexing system to lower node resource requirements. The hard fork is part of the network improvements that drove transaction volume and user interaction for the blockchain network in 2025. As a catalyst for increased adoption, mainnet activation could tie in with milestones in the 2026 roadmap .

BNB price outlook: bulls eye gains towards $1000 BNB has demonstrated remarkable resilience in recent weeks. In mid-December, as bears pushed BTC under $84,500, the Binance Coin price fell to $820. However, with buyers helping to steady Bitcoin, BNB has found a fresh footing and climbed to above $900. BNB price chart from CoinMarketCap. Per CoinMarketCap, the altcoin’s value was up 2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 7% in the past week. By hovering around $905, the Binance ecosystem coin has flipped to levels last seen on December 13, 2025. The latest bounce, which came as BTC traded to highs above $93,500, happened amid a 27% spike in trading volume. Data showed the volume stood at over $2.1 billion. BNB’s market capitalisation was at over $124 billion, with the token holding onto its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. A bullish move above $900 may see buyers target $1,000. Broader crypto market recovery and institutional interest, which increased in the latter months of 2025, will drive fresh gains. The regular token burns have also reduced supply, creating a deflationary effect that supports price appreciation.

The last time STRC traded at par was in early November, when it stayed there for about four trading days and led to roughly $100 million in market sales, according to the data on the company’s website. Strategy’s preferred stock structure adds Bitcoin without upfront dilution Between December 29 and December 31st, Strategy bought 1,287 BTC, pushing its total Bitcoin reserve to ₿673,783, while its USD reserve rose by $62 million, reaching $2.25 billion. The activity came as STRC showed a variable dividend of 11.00%, an effective yield of 11.01%, and a 30-day historical volatility of 12%. Under Strategy’s current structure, Saylor can sell STRC with an 11% yield and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. A $100,000 STRC sale would fund the purchase of 1 BTC at $100,000, creating an annual dividend obligation of $11,000, according to data on the company’s website. If Bitcoin somehow hits $1 million five years from now, Strategy would still owe the same annual dividend payments worth $55,000, while the Bitcoin holding would be worth $1 million. That leaves a $900,000 capital gain, reduced by dividends paid, for a net gain of $845,000 tied to that position. According to Strategy, the $55,000 in dilution tied to dividend payments is small compared with the $845,000 gain tied to the Bitcoin holding. The model depends on Bitcoin outperforming the 11% dividend rate, with no change to the dividend size as the asset value grows. Capital activity details show common stock sales and unused capacity Trading data shows STRC carrying a notional value of $2,958.7 million, with a 30-day average trading volume of $51.3 million, down 2.16%. The next record date is January 15, and the next payout date is January 31, but STRC also carries a BTC rating of 6.2x. During December 29 to December 31st, no STRC, STRF, STRK, or STRD preferred shares were sold, with available issuance at $4,042.4 million for STRC, $1,619.3 million for STRF, $20,335.0 million for STRK, and $4,014.8 million for STRD. During that same week, 1,255,911 shares of MSTR Class A common stock were sold, generating $195.9 million in net proceeds and leaving $11,502.8 million available for future issuance. From January 1 to January 4, 2026, Strategy said 735,000 MSTR Class A shares were sold, raising $116.3 million, as remaining availability for common stock issuance stood at $11,386.3 million.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier cryptocurrency traded firmly at $94,000 on the Binance USDT pairing as of early trading on April 2, 2025. This surge represents not just a numerical high but a powerful psychological milestone within the ongoing market cycle. Consequently, analysts and investors are scrutinizing the confluence of factors propelling this ascent. This article provides a factual, in-depth examination of the rally’s context, its technical and fundamental drivers, and the broader implications for the global financial landscape. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Decoding the $94,000 Milestone The breach of $94,000 marks a continuation of Bitcoin’s impressive quarterly performance. To understand its significance, we must examine recent price action. Bitcoin consolidated for several weeks between $82,000 and $88,000, building a strong support base. Subsequently, a surge in buying volume, particularly from institutional entities, catalyzed the breakout. Market data shows spot trading volumes spiked by approximately 35% in the 24 hours leading to the milestone. Furthermore, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts reached a multi-month high, indicating sustained trader conviction. Comparatively, this price point places Bitcoin’s market capitalization well above $1.8 trillion. This valuation rivals some of the world’s largest traditional assets. The rally has also positively impacted the broader cryptocurrency market, often called the ‘altcoin season’. However, Bitcoin’s dominance rate—its share of the total crypto market cap—remained stable at around 52%. This stability suggests the move is driven by dedicated capital flowing into Bitcoin itself, rather than a generalized rotation from other assets. Technical Breakout: The price moved above a key resistance level that had held for over a month. Volume Confirmation: The advance was supported by significantly higher trading volume, validating the move’s strength. Market Sentiment: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index shifted into ‘Extreme Greed’ territory, reflecting heightened investor optimism. Catalysts Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Several verifiable macroeconomic and sector-specific developments have converged to support Bitcoin’s price. Primarily, evolving monetary policy expectations in major economies have played a crucial role. Recent indications from central banks about a potential pause in aggressive interest rate hikes have weakened the US dollar index. Historically, a weaker dollar often correlates with strength in hard assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, the sustained inflow into US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has provided a constant source of institutional demand. On-chain data provides further evidence of a strong foundation. The number of Bitcoin addresses holding over 1,000 BTC (often called ‘whales’) has increased steadily. Meanwhile, the percentage of Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains near all-time highs, indicating a preference for long-term holding over short-term profit-taking. This holder behavior reduces sell-side pressure. Network fundamentals also remain robust, with the hash rate—a measure of computational security—continuing its upward trajectory, signaling strong miner commitment. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the changing narrative around Bitcoin’s role. “This rally is distinct from previous cycles because it is increasingly driven by institutional adoption as a treasury reserve asset and a hedge against fiscal inflation,” notes a report from Fidelity Digital Assets. Regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions has also provided a more stable operating environment for large investors. For instance, recent framework updates in the European Union and progress toward clear digital asset legislation in the United States have reduced systemic uncertainty. Market technicians point to the importance of the next resistance levels. The $94,000 zone itself may now act as support. The primary focus for bulls is the psychological $100,000 level. A clean break above that could open a path toward the next major technical targets. However, analysts uniformly caution about volatility. They remind investors that sharp corrections are common in cryptocurrency markets, even within strong bull trends. Risk management, therefore, remains paramount. Historical Context and Future Trajectory To fully appreciate the $94,000 price, a historical lens is essential. Bitcoin’s journey has been characterized by cycles of exponential growth followed by significant drawdowns. The current price places Bitcoin approximately 50% above its previous all-time high set in the 2021 cycle. This achievement underscores the asset’s resilience and growing adoption curve. The timeline below illustrates key milestones leading to this point: Date Milestone Approx. Price Q4 2023 Approval of first US Spot Bitcoin ETFs $42,000 Q1 2024 Fourth Bitcoin ‘Halving’ event $63,000 Q4 2024 Sustained institutional ETF inflows begin $78,000 April 2025 Break above $94,000 resistance $94,000 Looking forward, several events could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. The continued integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance, often called ‘TradFi’, is a key trend. Major payment networks are expanding their crypto settlement capabilities. Moreover, geopolitical tensions and currency devaluation in certain regions continue to drive retail adoption as a store of value. The long-term thesis around Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ appears to be gaining mainstream acceptance, providing a fundamental support layer beneath the current price action. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $94,000 is a significant event that reflects deep-seated shifts in global finance. This analysis has detailed the technical breakout, the confluence of macroeconomic and on-chain catalysts, and the expert consensus on sustainability. The move is supported by institutional adoption, regulatory evolution, and robust network fundamentals. While volatility remains an inherent characteristic of the asset class, the breach of this barrier underscores Bitcoin’s maturing market structure and its growing acceptance as a legitimate financial asset. The Bitcoin price milestone at $94,000 is therefore more than a number; it is a testament to the enduring evolution of decentralized digital currency. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $94,000 mean for the average investor? It signifies a new phase of market maturity and heightened mainstream attention. For investors, it underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s volatility and conducting thorough research before allocating capital, rather than chasing price momentum. Q2: How does the current rally compare to Bitcoin’s 2021 bull run? The current rally appears more institutionally driven, with sustained ETF inflows providing a steady demand base. The 2021 run was heavily influenced by retail speculation and leverage, whereas 2025’s action shows stronger on-chain holder conviction and involvement from regulated financial entities. Q3: Could the price fall sharply from here? Yes. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. While the trend is positive, corrections of 20-30% are common within bull markets. Investors should be prepared for significant price swings in both directions. Q4: What is the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? The primary psychological and technical resistance is the $100,000 mark. A decisive break and hold above that level would be a major bullish signal, with analysts then looking toward longer-term projections based on historical cycle patterns. Q5: Are other cryptocurrencies rising alongside Bitcoin? Often, yes, in a phenomenon known as the ‘altcoin season’. However, during this specific move to $94,000, Bitcoin’s market dominance held steady, suggesting capital was focused directly on BTC. Broader market rallies typically follow after Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a new high.

Data from Dune Analytics shows that spending across Visa-backed crypto cards increased steadily throughout last year, a significant growth. Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target Across six Visa-partnered crypto card programs, total net spending rose from $14.6 million in January 2025 to $91.3 million by December. The increase represents a 525% jump over the year and reflects growing consumer comfort with paying directly from crypto wallets at traditional points of sale. The cards are issued by a mix of crypto payment platforms and decentralized finance projects, including EtherFi, Cypher, GnosisPay, Avici Money, Exa App, and Moonwell. ETH's price trends slightly to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview EtherFi and Cypher Lead Visa Crypto Card Spending Among the tracked programs, EtherFi recorded the highest spending volume, accounting for $55.4 million in transactions during 2025. That figure placed it well ahead of Cypher, which ranked second with $20.5 million in total spend. The remaining card issuers posted smaller but consistent increases, suggesting broader participation across the ecosystem rather than growth driven by a single outlier. Monthly spending data shows a gradual rise throughout the year, with no major spikes or sharp reversals. Analysts say this pattern points to routine usage rather than one-off events. Commenting on the data, Polygon researcher Alex Obchakevich noted that crypto card spending increasingly reflects regular financial behavior, indicating that crypto-linked cards are moving beyond experimental use cases. Visa Expands Stablecoin Infrastructure Visa’s growing role in crypto payments has been supported by its expanding stablecoin infrastructure. The payments firm now enables stablecoin settlement across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Stellar. This setup allows card issuers to convert crypto balances to fiat in real time during transactions, while still relying on Visa’s global merchant network. In December 2025, Visa also launched a stablecoin advisory team focused on helping banks, merchants, and fintech companies design and manage stablecoin-based products. The initiative highlights Visa’s view that blockchain-based settlement and programmable money are becoming more relevant to mainstream payments. Outlook for Crypto Card Usage in 2026 With spending volumes rising and infrastructure continuing to expand, crypto card usage is expected to grow further in 2026. While volumes remain concentrated in the U.S., Europe, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the steady increase suggests consumer crypto spending is becoming more normalized.

The weekly gain stands at 5%, with trading volume over $17 billion in the past 24 hours. The price briefly touched the $3,160–$3,200 zone, which several traders mark as an area of resistance. Market participants are watching this level closely for signs of a breakout or rejection. ETH/BTC Chart Shows Familiar Pattern A chart shared by Sykodelic tracks Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin from 2016 to 2026. In past cycles, ETH began gaining on BTC ahead of major market tops. These periods are shown as green boxes on the ETH/BTC chart, starting with a breakout and ending as broader altcoins gained strength. Sykodelic noted that Ethereum appears to be entering this phase again. They wrote , “What we can see here very clearly is that $ETH is currently at the beginning stage of its outperformance against Bitcoin.” Interestingly, the ETH/BTC ratio is now around 0.034, and the recent breakout above a long-term trendline has sparked fresh interest. They added that Ethereum tends to outperform during periods of expanding market liquidity. “We have not had that yet this cycle,” they said, suggesting that Ethereum may still be early in this phase. The structure of the chart, according to Sykodelic, follows the same path as past rotations. Separately, a daily chart from Ali Martinez shows Ethereum trading within a symmetrical triangle, formed by lower highs and higher lows since December. The price is now near the tip of that triangle, around $3,130. According to Martinez, a breakout could lead to a 30% move in either direction. Resistance is marked at $3,300. If broken, Ethereum could move toward $4,000. If rejected, the downside level sits near $2,190. Volume remains steady, and traders are watching for a breakout or breakdown as the price nears the end of the pattern. Repeating Setup from Previous Cycle? CryptoWZRD compared Ethereum’s recent correction to one seen in mid-2024. At that time, ETH fell 46% before entering a 12-week consolidation, then moved higher. The latest drop mirrors that pattern. ETH is now trading between $2,800 and $3,200, close to where the last range formed. They said, “ Ethereum has to hold the lows, or it will break the range ,” pointing to the lower end of the current structure. The zone remains intact for now and could build the base for another leg higher, provided it holds. In the meantime, ETH is 36% below its all-time high of August 2025 (per CoinGecko data). Buyers continue to accumulate , and there are some predictions that the cycle will go past to $7,000-$10,000.

This paradoxical scenario, reported by CoinDesk and based on verifiable data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, raises critical questions about the sustainability of the current price rally and the underlying health of the digital asset market. The data suggests a market moving on thin ice, with participation drying up despite headline-grabbing price gains. Crypto Spot Trading Volume Hits a Critical Inflection Point The core metric revealing market stress is the aggregate spot trading volume across major cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Glassnode’s on-chain analysis, this volume has contracted sharply, falling to levels not witnessed since the fourth quarter of 2023. This decline is particularly noteworthy because it encompasses both Bitcoin and the broader universe of altcoins. Consequently, the market exhibits a clear lack of broad-based participation. Typically, a healthy bull market features rising prices accompanied by increasing or sustained trading activity, which validates investor conviction. The current environment, however, presents a contradictory picture where price appreciation occurs alongside dwindling transactional interest. Several factors may contribute to this volume contraction. First, the memory of a major liquidation event in October 2024 continues to loom large, having previously triggered warnings about deteriorating market liquidity. Second, macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny in key jurisdictions may be prompting a ‘wait-and-see’ approach among institutional and retail traders alike. Finally, the migration of activity to derivatives and over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which are not fully captured in public spot volume metrics, could be a partial, though not complete, explanation for the observed trend. Historical Context and Liquidity Warnings Market analysts have long monitored trading volume as a key indicator of market depth and health. The current low-volume environment echoes patterns seen in late 2023, a period characterized by market consolidation after a significant rally. The warnings about liquidity shortfalls that emerged post-October 2024 are now manifesting in the data. Thin order books can lead to increased price volatility, as fewer buy or sell orders are needed to move the market significantly. This creates a fragile foundation for any sustained price advance, making the market more susceptible to sharp reversals if a large seller enters the market. Bitcoin’s Price Recovery Masks Underlying Weakness Bitcoin’s climb back to $94,000 represents a remarkable technical achievement, potentially signaling a break from previous resistance levels. However, the accompanying slump in crypto spot trading volume injects a strong note of caution. This dynamic often suggests that the rally is being driven by a relatively narrow set of participants, potentially large holders (whales) or algorithmic traders, rather than a surge of new capital from a diverse investor base. The price action, therefore, may reflect market mechanics and sentiment among a small cohort rather than robust, organic demand. To illustrate the divergence, consider the following comparison of market states: Market Metric Healthy Bull Market Signal Current Market Signal (Q1 2025) Price Trend Upward Upward (BTC ~$94K) Spot Trading Volume Increasing or Stable Decreasing to Multi-Month Lows Market Participation Broad (Retail & Institutional) Narrow (Indicated by low volume) Underlying Demand Strong Weak (Divergence suggests lack of conviction) This table highlights the core contradiction. The rally lacks the volume confirmation that technical analysts and seasoned traders look for to validate a trend. Key terms to understand this scenario include: Volume Confirmation: The principle that significant price moves should be supported by high trading volume to be considered legitimate and sustainable. Market Liquidity: The ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without causing a drastic change in its price. Low volume often correlates with low liquidity. Divergence: A technical analysis term for when the price of an asset and an indicator (like volume) move in opposite directions, often signaling a potential reversal. Implications for Altcoins and the Broader Crypto Ecosystem The decline in trading activity is not isolated to Bitcoin. Glassnode data indicates that altcoin spot volumes are also languishing at depressed levels. This has profound implications for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Typically, a strong Bitcoin rally eventually spills over into altcoins, a phenomenon known as ‘altseason.’ However, the current low-volume environment suggests that capital is not rotating into these alternative assets. This could indicate that investors are either fully allocated, lacking risk appetite for more speculative assets, or simply not convinced of the rally’s longevity. The health of the altcoin market is often a barometer for overall crypto market sentiment, and its current stagnation alongside Bitcoin’s rise is a significant red flag. Expert Analysis and Market Psychology Seasoned market observers interpret this volume-price divergence through the lens of market psychology. A low-volume rally can be a sign of investor exhaustion or complacency. After a significant move, a period of consolidation with healthy volume is expected. The absence of such volume suggests that the move may be nearing its end, as fewer new buyers are willing to enter at higher prices. Furthermore, it indicates a lack of selling pressure, which, while positive in the short term, can quickly reverse if a catalyst triggers a wave of sell orders into an illiquid market. The current setup underscores the importance of looking beyond headline price figures to underlying on-chain and market structure data for a complete picture. Conclusion The data is clear and presents a cautionary narrative: while Bitcoin’s price recovery to $94,000 is a notable technical event, the simultaneous plunge in crypto spot trading volume to its lowest point since November 2023 cannot be ignored. This divergence historically signals reduced market participation, weak underlying demand, and raises valid concerns about the rally’s durability and the market’s overall liquidity depth. Investors and traders should monitor volume trends closely for a return to healthier, confirmed price action. The market’s next major move will likely depend on whether trading activity can re-engage to support these higher price levels or if the current thin volume presages a significant correction. The paramount lesson is that in cryptocurrency markets, price tells only half the story; volume provides the crucial context. FAQs Q1: What does ‘crypto spot trading volume’ refer to? A1: It refers to the total value of cryptocurrencies being bought and sold on exchanges for immediate delivery (the ‘spot’ price), as opposed to futures or derivatives contracts. It’s a direct measure of market activity and liquidity. Q2: Why is low trading volume a concern during a price rally? A2: Low volume during a rally suggests the price increase is not supported by broad market participation. It can indicate the move is driven by a small number of participants and may be more vulnerable to a sharp reversal if selling pressure emerges. Q3: Does low spot volume mean all trading has stopped? A3: No. It indicates a reduction in activity on visible spot exchanges. Trading can shift to over-the-counter (OTC) desks or derivatives markets, but a significant, sustained drop in reported spot volume is still a key indicator of changing market dynamics. Q4: How does this affect altcoins? A4: Low overall spot volume typically means less capital is flowing into the market. This often negatively impacts altcoins more than Bitcoin, as they are generally considered higher-risk assets and require strong market-wide liquidity and sentiment to rally significantly. Q5: What would signal a return to a healthier market structure? A5: A sustained increase in spot trading volume that confirms the price trend would be a positive signal. This would show new capital entering the market and broader investor conviction, providing a more solid foundation for continued price appreciation.

The altcoin market, which had been trending upwards over the weekend, closed a relatively slow day as most tokens traded sideways with little movement. Over the past 24 hours, the overall cryptocurrency market cap surged above $3.23 trillion for the first time since mid-December. Market sentiment had been improving over the weekend as Bitcoin managed to reclaim $90,000 and pushed forward. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index entered neutral territory at 42, after spending the better part of December in extreme fear. Why is Bitcoin price up today? Bitcoin price rallied to an intraday high of $93,408 today, as markets digested escalating geopolitical uncertainty following US airstrikes in Caracas and the reported capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Historically, such periods of instability tend to push investors toward perceived safe-haven assets. While Bitcoin has traditionally been considered a risk-on asset, it is increasingly viewed as a form of “digital gold” during sovereign crises. The potential for global economic fallout and currency devaluation has likely spurred fresh demand, and this renewed appetite for Bitcoin could also explain why altcoins saw comparatively muted action despite the broader uptrend. In times of geopolitical stress, capital tends to consolidate into the most liquid and widely recognised assets, leaving alternative tokens trailing in relative performance. Adding to the momentum is speculation around Venezuela’s alleged 600,000 BTC shadow reserve, worth approximately $60 billion. Some market watchers suggest that if the Trump administration decides to seize these assets and add them to its reserve, a notable portion of the supply would be removed from circulation. It could create a potential supply shock at a time when exchange reserves are already sitting near record lows. Carlitosway @Carlitoswa_y · Follow Everyone’s watching Venezuela’s oil.But the real story is Bitcoin.600,000 $BTC . Twice the U.S. government’s pre raid stash. Twelve times the German liquidation that rattled the market.Quietly accumulated through gold swaps, oil for $USDT trades, and black market mining. Now 6:56 PM · Jan 5, 2026 79 Reply Copy link Read 54 replies Bitcoin’s January surge also coincides with the so-called January Effect, where investors re-enter markets after selling in late December for tax-related reasons. This seasonal pattern can take several weeks to fully play out, further supporting the idea of sustained buying pressure. Meanwhile, over the past few days, Bitcoin open interest has climbed steadily, rising by 4% on Monday to over $138 billion. Short positions have taken a hit, with liquidations crossing $210 million, helping fuel further upside in price. There’s also signs of institutional demand returning as US spot Bitcoin ETFs have opened 2026 with strong inflows, reflecting continued interest from institutional investors. Combined, these macro events and speculative narratives are all feeding into today’s upward move as Bitcoin pushes closer to the $94K resistance area. What’s next for Bitcoin price? As mentioned before, $94,000 stands as the next resistance area that Bitcoin price needs to clear to confirm a potential trend reversal and set the stage for a sustained move higher. A clean breakout above this zone would likely trigger fresh momentum and open the door toward new all-time highs. On the downside, however, there are two unfilled CME futures gaps that have formed during recent weekend price action. These zones often act as price magnets, drawing Bitcoin back toward them before the market can establish a clear direction. Bitcoin CME Futures 1-hour chart. Source: CM on X. Bears may be looking to exploit this setup by defending the $94,000 resistance and forcing a pullback toward these gap areas. This could keep prices under pressure in the short term until the lower levels get tested and potentially filled. CM @CryptomechanicX · Follow Can we just liquidate the bears first who are shorting $BTC because of these CME gaps? 8:14 PM · Jan 5, 2026 10 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter According to the 24-hour liquidation heatmap from CoinGlass, Bitcoin price faces a dense cluster of liquidation levels just above $94,000 and continuing through the $96,000 to $97,000 range. Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. These zones represent heavily leveraged short positions that could get wiped out if Bitcoin pushes higher, creating conditions for a potential liquidation cascade on the upside. If Bitcoin manages to break above $94,000 convincingly, these stacked liquidation bands may act as fuel, forcing short-covering and rapid price acceleration through the $96,000 area. In that case, the rally could snowball quickly as traders attempt to exit losing positions, adding to the momentum. However, the chart also shows notable liquidity bands between $91,000 and $89,000, reinforcing the possibility of a retracement if bulls fail to sustain upward pressure. These levels could become short-term targets if sellers regain control or if funding rates cool off after the recent squeeze. Overall, Bitcoin appears to be in a critical range, with $94,000 acting as a pivot. A breakout could trigger a sharp move toward the $97,000 region, while failure to hold recent gains may drag prices back toward the CME gap zones around $88,000. At press time, Bitcoin price was trading just above $93,500, with gains of nearly 3%. Top altcoin gainers for the day In the past 24 hours, the market cap of all altcoins combined rose 3.5% to $1.48 trillion before facing a sharp drop in the later trading hours and settling at $1.39 trillion at press time. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin in terms of market capitalisation, rose from $3,100 to $3,200 before stabilising around $3,162 with gains of just 1% over the day. Other large-cap altcoins such as XRP (XRP), BNB (BNB), and Cardano (ADA) saw gains ranging between 1-3%. While the majority of the remaining top 100 altcoins also printed green, some of the top laggards of the day were MYX Finance (MYX), Bonk (BONK), and Midnight (NIGHT), posting losses of 19%, 9% and 8%, respectively. The top gainers of the day were Render (RENDER) and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), two AI-focused cryptocurrencies that clocked gains between 20–25% in the daily session, largely due to bullish revenue forecasts from AI-chip making giant Nvidia for the fiscal 2026 Q4. Stacks (STX) also stood out from the rest of the market with gains of 14.6% over the day as part of the new year rebound and growing demand among derivative traders, as evidenced by a spike in futures Open Interest.

While traders search for opportunities in AI, payments, and blockchain infrastructure, the challenge remains finding projects with actual utility rather than empty promises. This list examines four presale projects currently gaining attention: Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), which secured major sports partnerships with the Dolphins; DeepSnitch AI, offering AI-powered trading analytics; Remittix, focused on cross-border payment solutions; and Bitcoin Hyper, building Layer-2 infrastructure for Bitcoin. Each project targets different sectors, but only some have demonstrated working technology and institutional backing that could indicate long-term viability in the crypto presale space. 1. Zero Knowledge Proof: The Crypto Project Playing in the Big Leagues Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is building blockchain technology for privacy-focused AI and has already secured partnerships that set it apart from typical presale projects. The project signed multi-year deals with the Dolphins, a major sports organization with a large fanbase. These sponsorships aren’t just branding exercises. Dolphins is working with Zero Knowledge Proof as its official cryptographic protocol partner, testing the technology for fan experiences, player analytics, and secure data management. The Dolphins are using it to track player performance and prevent injuries while keeping health data private. The real-world applications make ZKP crypto one of the best crypto presale options for investors looking beyond speculation. Both sports teams will actively implement ZKP crypto’s technology in their operations, providing actual use cases rather than future promises. ZKP crypto’s technology uses zero-knowledge proofs, which allow AI systems to verify information without exposing the underlying data. This addresses a major challenge in AI: how to use data effectively while maintaining privacy. The sports partnerships also provide massive visibility. This exposure helps the project reach mainstream audiences that most crypto projects never access. These partnerships position Zero Knowledge Proof as the best crypto presale for those seeking projects with institutional backing and proven utility. 2. DeepSnitch AI: AI Agents for Crypto Trading DeepSnitch AI is a crypto presale project that offers trading analytics through AI agents. The platform uses five AI agents designed to analyze market data and track sentiment changes in the crypto space. The team has deployed three of these AI agents so far, making the core features available to users. These tools provide data on market movements and help identify shifts in trader sentiment. The project focuses on giving traders access to AI-powered analytics during their trading activities. It’s among the newer tokens launching as interest grows in AI-related crypto projects with functional use cases. 3. Remittix: Cross-Border Payment Solution Remittix is a DeFi crypto presale project focused on cross-border payments. The platform is designed to facilitate crypto-to-fiat transfers for traditional financial institutions. The project offers two main features: a system for users to make crypto payments and a gateway for merchants to accept cryptocurrency. The platform attempts to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and conventional banking systems. Remittix is part of the payments sector within DeFi, which deals with transferring value across borders. Several projects in this space are working on similar solutions to connect digital currencies with traditional financial infrastructure. 4. Bitcoin Hyper: Layer-2 Solution for Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper is a presale project developing a Layer-2 rollup for the Bitcoin network. The platform is designed to enable faster and cheaper transactions compared to Bitcoin’s base layer. One of the project’s goals is to allow Solana decentralized applications to be ported onto the Bitcoin network. This would expand Bitcoin’s functionality beyond its current capabilities as primarily a store of value. The mainnet launch has been pushed back from Q4 to 2026, and the project hasn’t provided recent development updates. Bitcoin Hyper is one of several Layer-2 solutions being built for Bitcoin as developers work to add more transaction capacity to the network. Bottom Line The crypto presale market presents diverse opportunities across AI, payments, and infrastructure sectors. DeepSnitch AI targets traders seeking analytics tools, Remittix focuses on cross-border payment solutions, and Bitcoin Hyper aims to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities through Layer-2 technology. However, Zero Knowledge Proof stands out with established partnerships that provide tangible value beyond typical presale projects. Its multi-year deal with the Dolphins offer access to 428+ million fans and real-world use cases in sports data management. The combination of functional AI technology, institutional backing, and mainstream visibility makes ZKP crypto a strong choice among the best crypto presale options for investors looking for working projects rather than just promises.

56858478,https://cryptonews.com/?p=470439,1767634627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56858478.jpeg,Crypto Rallies on January Capital Deployment as Focus Shifts to U.S. Jobs Data: Laser Digital,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-rallies-on-january-capital-deployment-as-focus-shifts-to-us-jobs-data-laser-digital/,cryptonews,"Crypto markets have posted a solid start to the new year, supported by renewed capital deployment and improving sentiment, according to Laser Digital in its latest market commentary. Over the weekend, Bitcoin climbed from the $87,000 handle to around $93,000 while Ether rose from roughly $2,970 to $3,200. Earlier, Bitcoin traded around $92,966, up roughly 1.8% over the past 24 hours, extending its early-January recovery after a volatile December. https://t.co/K3EVvdGf9H — Laser Digital (@LaserDigital_) January 5, 2026 Laser Digital said the move likely reflects a combination of year-end dynamics and fresh positioning. December selling pressure, often linked to tax-loss harvesting, appears to have faded, while January has brought new capital back into the market. Institutional demand is also showing signs of recovery with spot Bitcoin ETFs recording inflows on January 2 after consecutive outflows through much of December. Derivatives activity reinforced the bullish tone. The desk reflected options positioning at year-end, including roughly 3,000 lots of January-end Bitcoin call options traded on the final day of December, suggesting expectations for higher prices into early 2026. Asia Leads as Traders Watch US Sessions Price action in recent weeks has followed a familiar pattern with strong performance during Asian trading hours and weaker follow-through during U.S. sessions. Laser Digital said a shift in this dynamic would be an important signal for the market. Several strong U.S. sessions could prove constructive, potentially drawing sidelined investors back into risk assets. From a technical perspective, the desk pointed to $95,000 as a key resistance level for Bitcoin. A decisive break above that area could trigger further upside momentum, while failure to do so may keep prices range-bound in the near term. Jobs Data Takes Center Stage Macro factors are now firmly in focus. This week brings a flurry of U.S. labor market data, culminating in Friday’s non-farm payrolls report. Consensus expectations call for headline job gains of around 55,000 and an unemployment rate of 4.5%. Laser Digital expects the unemployment rate to matter more than the headline jobs number, echoing recent market behavior. With January rate cuts barely priced in, a weaker-than-expected report could push yields lower as markets reprice the path of monetary policy. However, a higher unemployment rate could weigh on risk assets, as investors are largely positioned for a “Goldilocks” outcome for the U.S. economy. Sentiment Improves as Fundamentals Hold Broader sentiment across digital assets has also improved. Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of Mercuryo, said investors are returning to crypto as they position for the year ahead. “Cryptocurrency markets are in the green as investors add digital gold to their portfolios,” Kozyakov said, noting renewed strength in Bitcoin alongside gains in Ethereum and Solana. He added that while sentiment weakened late last year, fundamentals remain intact, supported by continued growth in underlying infrastructure and rising liquidity in areas such as stablecoins. Geopolitical tensions remain a background risk, but market reaction so far has been muted. Laser Digital cautioned that spillover effects could still emerge, particularly in regions already under pressure, keeping macro uncertainty firmly in play as 2026 unfolds.

This sharp increase underscores a growing institutional appetite for BTC and signals that the broader crypto market is entering a more mature phase of adoption. According to BankXRP, the data reflects a strong institutional narrative, with market participants increasingly positioning themselves for the next leg of the crypto cycle. Open interest, a key metric indicating the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, is often viewed as a barometer for market confidence. Well, the recent spike suggests that institutional players are not only entering the market but are doing so with significant conviction. The surge is not limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP have all seen heightened volume activity, suggesting that investors are diversifying their exposure across multiple leading digital assets. This trend points to a broader recognition of cryptocurrencies as viable tools for portfolio allocation, risk management, and speculative strategies. Rising open interest often signals upcoming volatility, presenting opportunities for traders and long-term investors. Increasing participation from hedge funds, asset managers, and traditional institutions in crypto futures is boosting liquidity and market efficiency, further cementing Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a mainstream asset. According to CoinCodex , Bitcoin has reclaimed the $93,000 zone. Clearer regulations in key regions, alongside enhanced infrastructure from exchanges and custodians, have fueled institutional participation. Robust, transparent, and compliant futures and derivatives platforms are lowering barriers for sophisticated investors. As the market enters its next phase, rising open interest and active trading in BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP indicate institutions are shaping market dynamics. This trend points to a cycle of strategic positioning, deeper liquidity, and evolving narratives around digital assets Notably, CFBenchmarks reports a surge in Bitcoin and crypto futures open interest, underscoring growing institutional engagement and signaling crypto’s shift from speculative asset to core financial infrastructure.

Lee stated that Bitcoin could potentially reach a new all-time high this very month, challenging prevailing market sentiment and sparking intense discussion among cryptocurrency analysts and institutional investors worldwide. This prediction arrives during a period of notable market volatility, drawing immediate attention from financial publications like CoinDesk, which reported his comments extensively. Tom Lee’s Bitcoin All-Time High Rationale and Market Context Tom Lee’s forecast rests on a multi-layered analysis of current market dynamics. He explicitly stated that he does not believe Bitcoin has reached its peak for this cycle. Furthermore, he cautioned that it remains premature to conclude that Ethereum or other major cryptocurrencies have achieved their maximum highs for the year. Lee’s perspective carries substantial weight due to his firm’s extensive research and his own long-standing, often prescient, track record in cryptocurrency analysis. His view directly counters some more cautious outlooks that have emerged following recent price corrections. Lee anticipates that 2025 will be a volatile yet ultimately constructive year for digital assets. He provided a crucial timeline, warning that the first half of the year could experience short-term turmoil. He attributes this potential instability primarily to institutional rebalancing—a process where large investment funds and corporations adjust their portfolio allocations, often leading to significant capital flows and price pressure. Historically, such periods of institutional adjustment have created temporary dislocations before establishing stronger foundations for sustained growth. Institutional Rebalancing as a Bull Run Foundation The concept of institutional rebalancing forms the core of Lee’s short-term caution and long-term optimism. When major financial entities like pension funds, endowments, and publicly traded companies rebalance their holdings, they often execute large trades that can temporarily suppress prices, even for assets with strong fundamentals. Lee frames this not as a bearish signal, but as a necessary market-clearing event. He explained that this anticipated disruption would ultimately serve as the foundational bedrock for a major bull run he expects to materialize in the second half of 2025. This analysis aligns with observable patterns from previous market cycles, where institutional entry has often been preceded by periods of consolidation and volatility. The current landscape features increased institutional participation through Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasury allocations, and regulated financial products, making the rebalancing effect potentially more pronounced than in earlier, less mature market phases. Lee’s insight suggests investors should interpret near-term volatility through this strategic lens. Ethereum’s Parallel to Historic Bitcoin Performance Beyond Bitcoin, Lee offered a compelling comparative analysis for Ethereum. He noted that Ethereum’s current price action and market structure show striking similarities to Bitcoin’s own trajectory during the 2017-2021 bull run period. This historical parallel suggests Ethereum may be following a delayed but analogous path of adoption and valuation discovery. Based on this pattern recognition, Lee posits that ETH is poised for remarkable performance throughout the remainder of the year. This comparison is not merely anecdotal. Analysts can observe parallels in network upgrade completion (similar to Bitcoin’s SegWit era), growing institutional product development (like spot ETF approvals), and expanding real-world utility through decentralized finance and tokenization. Lee’s commentary implies that Ethereum may be entering a phase of accelerated recognition similar to Bitcoin’s breakout period following its initial institutional acceptance. Expert Credibility and Historical Forecast Accuracy Tom Lee’s predictions warrant serious consideration due to his established expertise and the methodological approach of Fundstrat. The firm employs quantitative models, on-chain data analysis, and macroeconomic indicators to inform its forecasts. Lee has been a vocal Bitcoin advocate for years, correctly identifying major trend shifts during previous cycles, though, like all analysts, not without occasional mis-timings. His dual role with Bitmine, a cryptocurrency mining entity, provides him with ground-level insights into network security and miner economics, adding a layer of practical industry knowledge to his macroeconomic views. The current prediction emerges within a specific financial context: moderating inflation data, evolving central bank policies, and the continued integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance. These factors collectively create an environment where cryptocurrency assets are increasingly evaluated as legitimate portfolio components rather than purely speculative instruments. Potential Market Impacts and Investor Considerations Should Bitcoin approach or breach its prior all-time high in the coming weeks, several market impacts could follow. First, it would likely trigger a wave of mainstream media coverage and renewed public interest. Second, it could validate the “store of value” narrative for a broader audience. Third, as Lee alluded to, it might catalyze a broader altcoin market rally, with Ethereum positioned as a primary beneficiary. Investors should note that all predictions involve uncertainty, and market movements can be influenced by unforeseen regulatory news, macroeconomic shocks, or technological developments. Key factors to monitor include: Institutional Flow Data: Weekly ETF inflow/outflow reports. On-Chain Metrics: Holder behavior and exchange reserves. Macro Conditions: Interest rate decisions and dollar strength. Network Fundamentals: Bitcoin hash rate and Ethereum transaction activity. Comparative Market Cycle Analysis Cycle Phase Bitcoin 2017-2021 Ethereum 2023-2025 (Projected) Institutional Entry Futures launch, corporate buys Spot ETF approvals, custody solutions Network Upgrade SegWit activation Dencun & scalability upgrades Price Discovery Break of prior ATH, then parabolic move Potential breakout from consolidation Conclusion Tom Lee’s prediction of a potential Bitcoin all-time high this month presents a decisive and optimistic near-term outlook amidst a complex market landscape. His analysis, which cites institutional rebalancing as a temporary headwind that will establish a foundation for a stronger second-half bull run, provides a structured framework for understanding current volatility. Furthermore, his comparison of Ethereum’s trajectory to Bitcoin’s historic bull run offers a compelling narrative for the broader digital asset ecosystem. While market predictions are inherently uncertain, Lee’s expertise and the underlying data points he references make this forecast a significant development for cryptocurrency investors and observers to consider as they navigate the evolving 2025 financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Tom Lee predict about Bitcoin? Tom Lee, Chairman of Fundstrat, predicted that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high within the current month. He based this on market analysis and does not believe Bitcoin has peaked for this cycle. Q2: Why does Tom Lee think the first half of 2025 will be volatile? Lee attributes expected short-term turmoil to institutional rebalancing, where large funds adjust their portfolio allocations. He views this as a temporary process that will create a stronger foundation for growth later in the year. Q3: What did Tom Lee say about Ethereum’s price potential? Lee stated that Ethereum’s current price action resembles Bitcoin’s 2017-2021 bull run pattern. He believes this parallel suggests ETH is poised for remarkable performance in 2025. Q4: What is institutional rebalancing and how does it affect crypto prices? Institutional rebalancing occurs when large investment entities like pension funds or ETFs buy or sell assets to maintain target portfolio weights. These large trades can create significant, though often temporary, price pressure. Q5: How reliable have Tom Lee’s past cryptocurrency predictions been? Tom Lee has a long track record in crypto analysis and has correctly identified major bullish trends in the past. However, like all market forecasts, his predictions involve timing uncertainty and should be considered as one informed perspective among many.

While Korean exchanges still process massive trade numbers, their design is reportedly locking out flexibility, as retail activity remains high, but the market structure has barely evolved. Traders in South Korea are stuck with chunky price increments that slow execution and make precision trading nearly impossible. And yes, UPbit still leads the pack, but dominance doesn’t mean immunity. The outflows prove that deeper liquidity doesn’t equal better liquidity when execution costs are going up. Large ticks restrict order books and slow trades on local Korean exchanges KRW markets on exchanges like UPbit and Bithumb have always run on large tick sizes. The reason? Stability. Bigger ticks help filter out noise and tame rapid swings. It keeps the order book clean, especially for the country’s army of retail traders. But that stability comes at a cost, and South Korea is feeling it now. Each exchange decides how small or large a tick is, and that controls how finely prices can change. On Korean platforms, orders clump together on the same levels, which can make depth look strong, but this also means spreads are wider, so traders end up paying more just to get in or out. UPbit divides its markets into three: KRW, BTC, and USDT. The KRW market includes pairs like XRP/KRW. According to Kaiko, UPbit owned about 70% of the country’s total trading volume throughout 2025, while Bithumb came second, and Coinone + Korbit barely register in comparison. Transaction volumes surge hard during global shocks, like when Donald Trump took office again or during the October 10 stock crash. By the end of 2025, the market in South Korea had basically narrowed down to two major players. UPbit remained the primary destination. Its edge came from handling more trades on more popular KRW pairs. That dominance also meant higher reported depth and smoother processing. But all that surface strength hasn’t stopped funds from flying offshore. Korea’s crypto liquidity gets squeezed by law, shocks, and price rallies Real-world events and token behavior are reshaping the way South Korea handles crypto liquidity. One standout issue is the Kimchi premium. It happens when Korean exchanges show higher prices than foreign platforms, especially for Bitcoin. This premium doesn’t last long, but it keeps popping up. When it does, traders jump on arbitrage opportunities, yanking liquidity across borders. That dynamic flipped again when Bitcoin hit new highs during 2025, as bull runs brought new capital into the system. Spreads tightened. Order books filled out. Top pairs became more active. Traders rushed in, which strengthened depth and made trades easier to execute. Unlike the martial law episode, this kind of surge built a loop. High prices attracted volume, which fed liquidity, which helped execution. The Kimchi premium, political shocks, and bull cycles show how unstable South Korea’s liquidity really is. Price gaps keep returning. Law and volatility drain books overnight. And high prices offer only a temporary fix.

The incidents are also becoming more violent on average. But Dragonfly partner Haseeb Qureshi found the recent uptick in violence per user is similar to that of 2021 levels but remains well below pre-2019 risk. Crypto Wealth and Violence In a detailed tweet, Qureshi, who referenced Bitcoin developer Jameson Lopp’s long-running database, revealed that the number of recorded attacks has increased over time and that the severity of those attacks has also risen. He explained that each incident was categorized into five levels of severity, ranging from minor to fatal, and that the average reported attack has become more violent over the years. When broken down by geography, Qureshi said Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have experienced the largest increases in violence, while North America remains the safest region overall, though it has still seen an increase in the absolute number of incidents. Qureshi then examined possible explanations for the rise, starting with crypto market capitalization. He said a simple regression comparing violent incidents with total crypto market cap produced an R-squared value of 0.45, meaning about 45% of the variation in reported violence can be explained by price alone, which supported the idea that higher crypto prices attract more crime. He added that other signals were tested, but none were as predictive as raw market cap. However, Qureshi stressed that this does not necessarily mean crypto is becoming more dangerous on a per-person basis. He proposed an alternative explanation – as prices rise, more people own crypto, which could lead to more total crimes even if the underlying risk per user stays the same. To test this, he used Coinbase’s monthly active users as a proxy for the number of active crypto holders and also normalized attacks by total market cap as a rough measure of violence per dollar of wealth. According to Qureshi, crypto appears to have been more dangerous in earlier years, such as 2015 and 2018, when the user base was much smaller. He noted that Coinbase MAUs grew from about 2 million in 2015 to roughly 120 million in 2025, a 60-fold increase, while violence did not rise at the same rate. While there has been a recent increase in violent events per user, Qureshi said it is moderate and is roughly in line with the 2021 level. This is still significantly lower than before 2019, and that violence per dollar of market cap has barely changed. High-Profile Wrench Attacks A number of serious assaults were reported in 2025. In January, Ledger co-founder David Balland was kidnapped from his home in France in a wrench attack and held for ransom for around 24 hours. Reports said Balland and his wife were taken to a nearby town, and the attackers severed one of his fingers to pressure associates into paying a ransom, before French authorities secured their release. In another case, a US resident visiting London was targeted after being lured into the wrong vehicle while waiting for an Uber outside a nightclub. The victim, identified as Jacob Irwin-Cline from Portland, Oregon, was later tricked into smoking a cigarette believed to be laced with scopolamine. While impaired, he unknowingly gave attackers access to his crypto accounts and ended up losing about $72,000 in XRP and $50,000 in BTC before being abandoned in an unfamiliar area.

The sector has added over $8 billion in market capitalization since the start of 2026, with major tokens posting double-digit gains that caught traders off guard. Source: CoinGecko This sudden reversal comes after a year marked by declining interest and contracting valuations. CryptoQuant data shows that memecoin dominance in the altcoin market hit a historic low in December 2025, dropping to 3.2% from 11% in November 2024. Source: CryptoQuant The last time this metric reached such depths preceded a massive memecoin rally, suggesting the current rebound could mark the beginning of another speculative cycle. Market Rebounds With Force After Holiday Slump PEPE led the charge with a 65% gain year-to-date, climbing 34% in a single 24-hour period. BONK also surged 49% while FLOKI jumped 40%. Trading volumes reached $9 billion as short liquidations amplified price movements. The rally began immediately after the holiday period, when traders typically maintain cautious positions. Lower volatility in Bitcoin created space for speculative assets to attract capital. In fact, during the same period, Bitcoin has turned a new leaf, starting the year by breaking the $90K resistance and currently trading around $93,000. Source: TradingView Dogecoin broke through a multi-year downtrend with over 20% gain while Shiba Inu added 18.9% on the week. On-chain data confirmed renewed accumulation in PUMP , BONK , and FLOKI as wallet interactions increased sharply. Social sentiment shifted dramatically as PEPE added roughly $3 billion to its market capitalization in a single day. The token’s trading volume exceeded the broader market average by more than three times, reflecting intense speculative interest. Fear of missing out spread rapidly across crypto platforms as sidelined traders rushed to capture momentum. Platform Dominance Shapes Sector Recovery According to Messari’s report , Pump.fun continues to dominate Solana’s token ecosystem, accounting for 70-77% of new launches and up to 25% of daily network transactions. Over 13 million tokens have been created through the platform since early 2024, representing more than one-third of all tokens on Solana. The platform has generated over $866 million in lifetime revenue while directing nearly all daily fees toward buybacks that have removed approximately 8% of PUMP’s circulating supply. Source: Messari Despite the emergence of competing launchpads, independent memecoins still control 86.2% of total market capitalization, according to CoinGecko’s State of Memecoins 2025 Report . Launchpad-based tokens peaked at 20.5% market share in January 2025 before declining, suggesting grassroots launches retain stronger community support. Dog-themed memecoins maintain dominance at 39.5% of the sector excluding Dogecoin, though frog and cat tokens like PEPE, POPCAT , and MEW have also captured attention. Source: CoinGecko Geographic interest remains concentrated in the United States, which accounted for 30% of memecoin-related page views in November 2025, up from 20% at the start of the year. Source: CoinGecko Seven of the top ten most interested countries are from emerging markets, collectively representing 38% of total interest, reflecting strong retail participation in regions with mobile-first access. Analysts Eye Historical Patterns for Guidance The current setup mirrors the conditions in late 2020 that preceded the 2021 memecoin explosion. A quiet December marked by low volumes gave way to sharp January gains fueled by post-tax-loss harvesting and renewed speculative appetite. That cycle eventually pushed the sector’s market cap from under $10 billion to more than $100 billion. Some analysts project the sector could reach $69 billion in market capitalization during Q1 2026 if current momentum holds. Sustained Bitcoin stability could provide the foundation for an extended rally as traders rotate capital into high-beta assets. Bitcoin climbed back above $92k on Monday as Asian stocks advanced and oil turned choppy after a US move in Venezuela reshaped global risk sentiment. #AsiaMarketOpen #CryptoMarket https://t.co/WJBohJCTQo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 5, 2026 However, caution remains warranted. The move could prove to be a bull trap if trading volumes fade or macroeconomic pressures intensify. Currently, key metrics to watch include open interest growth and shifts in capital toward higher-risk assets. If retail participation strengthens, 2026 could play out similarly to 2021’s memecoin surge, though heightened volatility will likely persist regardless.

According to a report from Watcher.Guru, the executive founded American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) and accumulated 5,427 BTC in a mere four-month span. This development, emerging from Palm Beach, Florida, in early 2025, raises significant questions about scale, strategy, and the evolving landscape of institutional crypto adoption. Eric Trump Bitcoin Firm Claims Rapid Dominance Eric Trump’s entry into Bitcoin mining represents a notable convergence of political legacy and digital asset entrepreneurship. The venture, American Bitcoin Corp, reportedly achieved its substantial Bitcoin treasury through aggressive operational scaling. Furthermore, industry analysts note that building a mining operation of this purported size typically requires extensive capital, energy contracts, and hardware procurement. Consequently, the four-month timeline presents an extraordinary case study in rapid deployment. For context, major publicly traded miners like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms took years to amass comparable Bitcoin reserves. The claim necessitates examining the specific strategies ABTC employed. Potential factors include strategic acquisitions of existing infrastructure, pre-secured partnerships with energy providers, or leveraging significant private capital. The company’s operational model remains a key point of interest for industry observers. The Mechanics of Rapid Bitcoin Accumulation Accumulating over 5,400 Bitcoin in four months is a formidable logistical and financial undertaking. To understand the scale, one must consider the mining process itself. Bitcoin mining involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles using specialized computers (ASICs). Success grants a “block reward” in Bitcoin, but the probability is tied to a miner’s share of the global network’s total computational power, known as hash rate. Therefore, to mine that volume of Bitcoin directly, a company would need to command a massive percentage of the global hash rate—a feat difficult to achieve quickly due to hardware supply chain constraints. This leads to alternative explanations for ABTC’s treasury growth: Strategic Purchases: The company may have used capital to buy Bitcoin directly from the market, supplementing or exceeding mined rewards. Infrastructure Acquisition: ABTC could have purchased existing mining facilities or entire companies, instantly gaining their hash power and any Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Hybrid Model: A combination of aggressive mining, market purchases, and potential treasury management strategies. Without detailed financial disclosures, the exact method remains speculative. However, the outcome positions ABTC, if verified, as a major new player in a competitive sector. Expert Analysis on Scaling and Viability Financial technology experts urge a measured perspective on such rapid growth claims. Dr. Lena Schmidt, a blockchain economist at the Digital Asset Research Institute, notes, “While theoretically possible with virtually unlimited capital, scaling a mining operation to this level in 120 days challenges conventional industry timelines. The key metrics to watch would be their energy cost per Bitcoin mined, the source of their hardware, and their operational hash rate. These figures determine long-term viability more than a snapshot of holdings.” Schmidt’s analysis highlights a critical point: sustainability. The Bitcoin mining industry faces intense scrutiny over energy consumption and economic efficiency. A company growing this quickly must also demonstrate it has secured low-cost, reliable power contracts—often the single most important factor for profitability. The geographical location of ABTC’s operations will therefore be highly relevant to its future performance. Contextualizing the Broader Mining Industry The announcement arrives during a period of significant consolidation and technological advancement in Bitcoin mining. Following the 2024 halving event, which cut block rewards in half, miners have faced increased pressure to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Larger, well-capitalized operations have a distinct advantage, leading to a more institutionalized industry. To illustrate ABTC’s claimed position, consider this comparative snapshot of major miners’ self-reported Bitcoin holdings as of Q1 2025: Company Approx. BTC Holdings Time to Accumulate American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) 5,427 BTC ~4 months (claimed) Marathon Digital Holdings ~28,000 BTC Built over 5+ years Riot Platforms ~12,000 BTC Built over 6+ years Core Scientific ~8,500 BTC Built over 4+ years This table underscores the atypical nature of the growth trajectory Eric Trump describes. If accurate, it suggests a departure from traditional organic scaling methods. The strategy may involve leveraging unique advantages in capital access or regulatory navigation. Potential Impacts and Market Reactions The emergence of a major mining firm with ties to a prominent political family could influence several areas. Firstly, it may attract further mainstream and institutional attention to the Bitcoin mining sector as a legitimate infrastructure play. Secondly, it could spark discussions about energy policy and the integration of mining with renewable or stranded energy sources, a topic gaining political traction. Market reaction has been cautiously observant. The price of Bitcoin showed minimal direct movement on the news, indicating that traders are awaiting verification of the claims and details on ABTC’s market activities. However, the narrative has undoubtedly increased media focus on the industrial scale of modern Bitcoin mining. It also highlights the sector’s evolution from a niche, enthusiast-driven activity to a capital-intensive industry attracting diverse investors. Conclusion Eric Trump’s assertion regarding the four-month rise of American Bitcoin Corp presents a remarkable story within the digital asset ecosystem. The claim of holding 5,427 BTC positions the new venture as a significant entity, though its long-term success will depend on transparent operational data and sustainable economics. This development reflects the ongoing maturation and institutionalization of Bitcoin mining, where scale, efficiency, and strategic execution are paramount. As more details emerge, the industry will closely watch whether ABTC’s rapid start translates into enduring power within the competitive landscape of Bitcoin firms. FAQs Q1: What is American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC)? American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) is a Bitcoin mining company founded by Eric Trump. The firm reportedly accumulated a treasury of 5,427 Bitcoin within its first four months of operation, according to public statements. Q2: How could a company mine so much Bitcoin so quickly? While direct mining at that scale in four months would be highly unusual, possible methods include using enormous capital to purchase mining hardware en masse, acquiring existing mining companies, buying Bitcoin directly on the open market, or employing a hybrid of these strategies. Q3: How does ABTC’s reported holdings compare to other miners? With 5,427 BTC, ABTC’s claimed holdings would place it among the larger private mining companies, though still smaller than the largest public miners like Marathon Digital, which holds tens of thousands of Bitcoin accumulated over many years. Q4: Why is the energy source important for a Bitcoin mining company? Electricity is the primary operational cost for Bitcoin mining. Access to low-cost, reliable power—often from renewable or underutilized sources—is critical for profitability and long-term sustainability, especially after the Bitcoin halving reduces block rewards. Q5: What does this mean for the Bitcoin mining industry? The rapid entry of a well-capitalized venture like ABTC signifies continued institutional interest and could accelerate industry consolidation. It highlights the shift towards large-scale, professionally managed operations and may influence discussions around energy use and regulatory frameworks for crypto mining.

A clean breakout could unlock higher upside targets, while failure at this level may trigger a near-term pullback as the market searches for stronger support before its next decisive move. A Push Straight Into The $3,160 Resistance Zone Lennaert Snyder noted in a recent update that Ethereum has pushed directly into a key resistance zone around $3,160. Similar to Bitcoin, ETH saw a typical Sunday pump that carried the price straight into overhead resistance, placing the market at a key decision point. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Overbought Levels With Weekend Pump, Why A Crash Could Be Coming With Ethereum now trading around the $3,160 level, Snyder explained that a confirmed 4-hour reclaim of the level could open the door for continuation longs. In that scenario, upside targets come in near $3,250, with $3,390 acting as the final objective. However, Snyder also cautioned that Monday sessions often fade or fully retrace Sunday-driven moves. A clear break in market structure could therefore validate short setups early in the week. If such a pullback unfolds, price may revisit lower levels in search of a higher low, potentially setting the stage for a more sustainable, smart-money-driven rally. On the downside, Snyder highlighted that a resistance-turned-support flip near $3,050 could provide an attractive entry, while a deeper sweep toward the $2,880 weak lows may also offer opportunities if demand steps in. Ethereum Holds A Broader Structural Support On The Weekly Chart According to More Crypto Online, Ethereum is still hovering near a broader structural support zone on the weekly chart. This area continues to provide a foundation where an upside reaction remains possible, even though such a move does not need to unfold immediately. The analyst noted that price could still carve out one additional low early next year before the market reveals a clearer move. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Record Over $600M In Outflows — Warning Signal For Traders? The major resistance zone overhead remains the most important reference point in the current structure. How Ethereum behaves as it approaches this region will be decisive in determining which of the larger market scenarios ultimately takes control. For now, both primary scenarios remain technically valid, and the weekly chart has not yet delivered confirmation of the market committing to a single path, keeping the broader outlook balanced and unresolved. This uncertainty reinforces the need for patience as the structure continues to develop. What will eventually shift probabilities is price action around these key zones. While the chart is not providing clear answers at the moment, it is clearly defining market conditions. These conditions are expected to help reveal Ethereum’s preferred direction in early 2026.

The year began positively, with last Friday alone pulling in $671 million. This pushed total inflows for the week to $582 million after earlier outflows. Smaller Altcoins Are Left Behind According to the CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows 2025 Report, Bitcoin struggled during 2025, which resulted in inflows dropping 35% to $26.9 billion. Falling prices also drove $105 million into short-bitcoin investment products, though the figure remains a very small segment with $139 million in total assets. Ethereum led the market and attracted $12.7 billion, a 138% increase compared with 2024. XRP and Solana also surged, with inflows of $3.7 billion (up 500%) and $3.6 billion (up 1,000%), respectively. Other altcoins faced weaker demand, after falling 30% year-on-year to $318 million. Sui raised $152 million, Chainlink $22 million, and ZCash $17 million, while Litecoin saw only $1 million over the year. Overall, investor focus shifted toward Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, leaving smaller coins largely behind. Multi-asset products, on the other hand, witnessed an outflow of $214 million. In 2025, the United States remained the largest recipient of digital asset investments, raking in $42.5 billion in inflows, down 12% from 2024. Germany led growth, attracting $2.5 billion compared to outflows of $43 million the year before. Canada also recovered and saw $1.1 billion in inflows after $603 million in outflows in 2024. Switzerland experienced modest gains as it pulled in $775 million, up 11.5% year-on-year. Next up was Hong Kong with $293 million in investments, followed by the Netherlands with $194 million, and France with $128 million. Cayman Islands and Luxembourg also brought in $42 million and $32 million, respectively. Sweden, however, suffered an exodus of $775 million, followed by Brazil with $1 million in outflows. Healthier Bitcoin Setup? Despite the choppy price action and the widespread negative sentiment, analyst Markus Thielen believes that Bitcoin could be entering 2026 in a healthier and more constructive position after a significant reset in market positioning. He explained that nearly $30 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum futures leverage has been unwound since last year’s October peak. This has reduced speculative excess and crowded trades. With investors starting the new year holding lighter, cleaner portfolios, the market has room to reset and move more organically. Thielen added that this leaner positioning removes the drag created by excessive leverage, which allows Bitcoin to better reflect demand rather than forced liquidations. As a result, Bitcoin may be free to follow its natural price trajectory, which, according to the analyst, could be higher.

The latest purchase increased its total Bitcoin reserve to over 5,427 BTC, worth more than $508.5 million at current BTC prices. The Trump family-backed firm currently ranks as the 19th-largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company by holdings, ahead of KindlyMd and below Next Technology Holding. Eric Trump, Chief Strategy Officer of ABTC, acknowledged that the firm has grown and surpassed a flurry of Bitcoin treasury companies in just over three months. At the time of publication, ABTC’s market capitalization stands at $1.65 billion. ABTC sees a surge in BTC Yield American Bitcoin has increased its total Bitcoin reserve to ~5,427 BTC and achieved a BTC Yield of ~105.0% from its Nasdaq debut on September 3, 2025 through January 2, 2026. pic.twitter.com/KbEujDVriw — American Bitcoin (@ABTC) January 5, 2026 The Trump-backed company added its Bitcoin holdings amid a combination of mining operations and strategic purchases. ABTC stated that the initiative follows an agreement with Bitmain, which includes BTC held in custody or pledged for miner purchases. ABTC recently unveiled its Bitcoin yield metric to boost its existing Satoshis Per Share (SPS) disclosure. The Bitcoin yield gauge measures the percentage change in SPS over defined periods. The Trump family-backed firm reported a surge in its SPS to 556. Since the company’s Nasdaq debut on September 4 , 2025, through January 2, 2026, American Bitcoin has achieved a BTC Yield of approximately 105%. The firm also promised to regularly update its users on its website and social media about its BTC holdings, SPS, Bitcoin Yield, and other performance metrics. American Bitcoin’s stock is trading at $2.05 at the time of writing, up 14.8% for the day. The Bitcoin mining firm’s share price has also surged nearly 16.5% in the past 5 days. Data from Quiver Quantitative revealed that ABTC insiders have traded the firm’s stock on the open market five times since July 2025. Two traders made purchases, while the remaining three made sales. The analytics firm also noted that LENDING CA, LLC, Anchorage, made no purchases and three sales of 2,534,490 shares for approximately $20,189,718. RICHARD BUSCH only bought 276,000 shares of ABTC for around $490,480. Quiver Quantitative noted that approximately 59 institutional investors added shares of ABTC stock to their portfolios, with no sales in Q4 2025. A flurry of Bitcoin mining companies also posted positive gains in their stocks on Monday, including Bitfirms, which surged nearly 10% to $2.86. Mara Holdings added 4.89% to $10.40, and Hut 8 Corp’s share price increased by 13.2% to $58.03. Other digital asset treasury companies (DATs) posted positive advances late last year, including Strive. The company added another 101.8 BTC in the last quarter of 2025, increasing its total BTC holding to approximately 7,696 BTC, valued at around $708 million. ABTC’s Bitcoin purchase follows BTC’s rally above $93K ABTC’s initiative to purchase additional BTC comes as Bitcoin’s price pushes above $93,000. The digital asset is currently trading at around $93,688, up more than 7% in the past 7 days. The surge in BTC prices comes as traders brace for the mix of geopolitical developments and early-year positioning across the markets. There’s a notable rebound in U.S. demand, evident in the surge of the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium in the first week of this year. The metric had dropped to its lowest level in 9 months on Thursday, recording a negative 0.018% amid BTC trading at around $88,000. The metric has improved to-0.03%, signaling a return of U.S. capital flows into the markets. As the overall crypto market recovers in the first week of 2026, traders are eyeing the $95,000 level for continued momentum. Head of OTC at Wintermute, Jake Ostrovskis, argued that it’s worth waiting for the U.S. market session to confirm or reject the move. He pointed to the late-2025 reverse pattern or U.S. selling, noting that BTC plummeted by 5.45% during U.S. trading hours, but gained 10% during APAC hours.

Controversial Bitcoin Sale According to documents titled “Asset Liquidation Agreement,” which Bitcoin Magazine has obtained, the BTC forfeited by Rodriguez and Hill is either in the process of being sold or has already been sold. The document indicates an agreement where the defendants consented to relinquish Bitcoin valued at approximately $6.3 million, which amounted to little over 57 BTC at the time the agreement was finalized on November 3, 2025. Interestingly, it appears that the Bitcoin transferred on November 3, 2025, did not enter the USMS’s custody directly. Instead, the cryptocurrency seems to have been sent straight to Coinbase Prime, likely for the purpose of sale. Potential Implications For Crypto Regulation This decision raises significant legal and ethical questions, particularly regarding compliance with Executive Order 14233. This Order stipulates that BTC acquired through criminal forfeiture—termed “Government BTC”—must not be sold and should instead be allocated to the established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If the USMS has indeed sold the forfeited Bitcoin, it indicates that they proceeded at their own discretion, potentially ignoring the legal mandate outlined in the Executive Order. The Executive Order also specifies that “Government BTC” falls under the category of “Government Digital Assets,” and it mandates that agency heads cannot sell or otherwise dispose of these assets except under certain conditions, none of which apply to the cases of Rodriguez or Hill. With this controversy surrounding the sale of seized Bitcoin, the actions of the USMS could spark further debate about how the government manages seized digital assets. BTC has risen closer to $94,300 at the time of writing, representing a significant 3% increase in the last 24 hours and 8% increase in the last seven days.

Related Reading: XRP Is Setting Up For Its ‘Next Explosive Move,’ Analysts Say: Here’s The Target After ending 2025 with a modest decline that challenged expectations around the traditional four-year cycle, the largest asset has reclaimed the $90,000 zone and is trading above $92,000. The move reflects a mix of technical breakouts, steady institutional inflows, and easing selling pressure, even with long-term skepticisms. BTC's price records moderate gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Technical Structure Points to Higher Levels On the daily chart, Bitcoin (BTC) has been forming a rounded base that resembles the early stages of a cup-and-handle pattern, a structure often associated with trend continuation. Recent candles have closed higher, though long upper wicks suggest some resistance near current levels. Analysts note that maintaining a sustained hold above the $89,500–$90,000 range is crucial to sustaining the bullish setup. A confirmed break above the $94,700 area could validate the pattern and open the door to a measured move toward the $100,000–$104,000 zone, implying roughly 10–12% upside from recent prices. Shorter-term indicators also show improving momentum, with higher lows forming on lower time frames and moving averages beginning to turn upward. However, elevated leverage on derivatives platforms means that pullbacks could still trigger sharp liquidations if support levels are breached. Bitcoin ETF Inflows and On-Chain Data Support the Move Beyond charts, underlying market data points to reduced distribution. Exchange inflows have dropped sharply since the end of December, signaling lower immediate selling pressure. On-chain metrics show both short-term and long-term holders moving fewer coins, suggesting a preference to hold rather than sell into strength. Institutional demand has also re-emerged through spot Bitcoin ETFs. Early January saw more than $600 million in net inflows in a single session, reinforcing the view that larger investors continue to treat Bitcoin as a portfolio allocation rather than a short-term trade. This steady accumulation has helped Bitcoin absorb macro-driven volatility, including recent geopolitical headlines that briefly lifted broader risk assets. Skepticism Remains as Market Eyes 2026 Outlook Not everyone is convinced the recovery will last. Economist Peter Schiff has reiterated his long-standing view that Bitcoin’s rally is unsustainable, arguing that recent gains in precious metals offer a stronger long-term case.

Still, Bitcoin remains roughly 26% below its all-time high, leaving room for further debate over valuation and direction.

Many argued that it wastes vast amounts of energy, strains power grids, and undermines global climate goals – claims that have become a common part of public debate. However, this narrative is increasingly being challenged as more data and analysis emerge. Claims that Bitcoin mining wastes energy or destabilizes grids are contradicted by university research and real-world grid data. Debunking Bitcoin Mining Myths ESG expert Daniel Batten has pushed back against misconceptions around Bitcoin mining while saying that many claims are not supported by evidence and persist due to outdated assumptions. In his analysis of Bitcoin and energy use, Batten explained that the idea that Bitcoin uses large amounts of energy, water, or electronic waste per transaction is incorrect, while pointing to multiple peer-reviewed studies and Cambridge University research that have shown BTC’s resource consumption is not driven by transaction volume. As a result, transaction activity can scale without increasing energy, water, or hardware use. He traces the origin of the “per transaction” narrative to a 2018 commentary by Alex de Vries, which he says was later debunked but widely cited. This is what led to long-lasting misunderstandings. On electronic waste specifically, Batten cited 2025 Cambridge findings which show that earlier estimates overstated Bitcoin’s e-waste by more than 1,200%. The researcher also disputed claims that Bitcoin mining destabilizes power grids. Instead, he cited a growing body of independent research that found that mining can instead support grid stability due to its flexible and interruptible load profile, particularly on grids with high levels of wind and solar. Meanwhile, studies from Duke University and other researchers have found that Bitcoin mining can provide grid balancing and ancillary services, a conclusion Batten says is supported by real-world data from Texas’ ERCOT grid. According to ERCOT records, BTC mining has contributed to near-daily grid stabilization through demand response and frequency regulation, including during extreme events such as the July 2022 Texas heatwave, while only one mild destabilizing incident has been documented. Electrified, Grid-Friendly, and Cheaper Batten even went on to challenge the claim that Bitcoin mining raises electricity prices for consumers, while mentioning US and Texas electricity cost data between 2021 and 2024 that show no abnormal increase in regions with high mining activity. He stated that BTC mining can lower system costs by monetizing excess renewable energy, reducing curtailment, deferring grid upgrades, and replacing the need for additional gas peaker plants. Cases in Norway and Kenya show that Bitcoin mining has been linked to lower electricity prices. On broader energy comparisons, Batten echoes Cambridge University’s view that comparing BTC’s energy use to entire countries is misleading. He says climate policy is focused on changing how energy is produced and managed, not simply cutting total consumption. He further noted that BTC mining is fully electrified, highly flexible, and capable of reducing methane emissions. Batten disputed claims that the crypto asset has an unusually high carbon footprint and indicated Cambridge estimates of about 39.8 MtCO2e in emissions, all from electricity use. Data also revealed that Bitcoin mining has crossed a 50% sustainable energy threshold globally.

As traders chase the next “ AI stock ” breakout, a strange overlap keeps showing up: when Bitcoin rips, a handful of crypto-linked AI-linked equities rip too. Especially the miners (and ex-miners) now rebranding themselves as AI/HPC hosting plays. Their pitch is measured less in hash rate and more in megawatts (MW) , multi-year contracts, and data-center-style lease language. The twist: these names can look like AI winners on green days, but when crypto volatility hits, they often snap right back into what the market treats them as first: leveraged Bitcoin proxies with a compute costume. So, in the next big Bitcoin move (up or down), how can you tell which “AI miners” and crypto stocks will ride it or profit most, and which will lag or get wrecked? Why Bitcoin, Miners, and “Compute” Can Trade Like One Risk Bucket In real time, traders don’t always separate business models; they separate exposure. In risk-on windows, capital often rotates into high-beta themes together: Bitcoin, crypto-linked equities, and AI/compute momentum. When volatility spikes or liquidity tightens, the unwind can look synchronized. The linkage is mostly tape mechanics: Risk-on rotation into BTC + miners + growth/AI. Risk-off de-risking of the same bundle. Basket behavior where “crypto equities” and compute beta get traded as one position. So a miner touting AI hosting can still behave like a leveraged Bitcoin proxy on a bad crypto day, even if its AI headlines are unchanged. From Hash Rate to Megawatts: Why the Infrastructure Story Resonates The AI angle isn’t purely hype. Bitcoin mining forced operators to solve the hard constraints first: power access, cooling, uptime, and facilities that resemble data centers. AI/HPC needs the same foundations (at scale), and power-secured sites are hard to replicate quickly. That’s the “capacity scarcity” pitch: if demand for AI compute keeps rising, the bottleneck isn’t just GPUs; it’s where you can actually run them. That’s also where NVIDIA (NVDA) enters the frame. NVDA is widely treated as the market’s flagship AI stock because its GPUs are central to modern AI training and inference. We're proud to announce a landmark partnership with @OpenAI to build new gigascale AI factories using millions of NVIDIA GPUs. This partnership will supply 10 gigawatts of GPUs to fuel @OpenAI 's data center growth. pic.twitter.com/CYEB2PdfWY — NVIDIA (@nvidia) September 22, 2025 NVIDIA doesn’t move because of Bitcoin , but it often sets the tone for whether investors are paying up for the broader “compute” trade. When that appetite is strong, it can make the AI-hosting angle from miners easier for traders to buy; when it weakens, hybrids can get pulled back into “just a Bitcoin proxy” treatment. In earlier cycles, investors have argued about hash rate, power costs, and BTC production economics. In the hybrid setup, they add a second yardstick: contracted MW and how long that capacity is spoken for. The catch is that markets may value the “MW math” on good days while still trading the stock mainly on Bitcoin beta in the short term. Why the AI Angle Shows Up Most When Crypto Isn’t Roaring The hybrid narrative tends to land best in softer crypto tape. In a range-bound market, pure-play miners can struggle to hold attention as hash-price compresses, network difficulty rises, and investors demand clearer paths to steadier cash flow. AI hosting offers a second storyline: instead of relying entirely on mining margins, a company can try leasing capacity to AI customers and turn fixed infrastructure into longer-dated revenue. That doesn’t eliminate crypto volatility, but it can keep a miner in the conversation (and sometimes keep capital engaged) between Bitcoin bursts. A Practical Hybrid Watchlist The easiest way to follow the theme is to track: (1) liquid Bitcoin-beta equities, and (2) miners with explicit AI/HPC hosting narratives, while keeping NVDA on the screen as the primary “compute sentiment” bellwether. Bitcoin-beta crypto equities (often move hand-in-hand with BTC sentiment): MARA : high-beta BTC proxy, increasingly discussed for data-center/compute optionality. RIOT : power strategy and infrastructure reuse are central to the bull case. COIN : not an AI play, but often moves with crypto risk appetite. Hybrids tied to AI/HPC hosting talk (still crypto-sensitive, but pitching MW contracts): HUT : reflected an AI infrastructure partnership involving Anthropic and Fluidstack, framed around large-scale MW capacity. CIFR : disclosed long-term AI hosting agreements with Fluidstack featuring sizable MW commitments and multi-year value language. CORZ : shifted capacity toward hosting CoreWeave’s NVIDIA GPU clusters under long-dated HPC contracts. IREN : positions itself as a “Bitcoin + AI data center,” expanding GPU/AI cloud efforts. Hut 8 has signed a 15-year, 245 MW AI data center lease at its River Bend campus with total contract value of $7.0 billion and up to $17.7 billion if all renewal options are exercised. @Google is providing a financial backstop that covers the lease payments and related… pic.twitter.com/j8fjDeDtVf — Hut 8 (@Hut8Corp) December 18, 2025 Compute backdrop (doesn’t track BTC directly, but often sets the AI tone): NVDA : widely viewed as the best single-stock bellwether for AI compute demand and sentiment. Why Counterparties and Terms Matter More Than the Headline “Hundreds of MW” is only as good as the contract behind it. For AI-focused investors, three details tend to separate substance from a trading slogan: Counterparty clarity: named customers/partners (and their credit) beat vague “AI pivot” claims. Deliverability: MW delivered and energized now beats optional expansion later. Duration and economics: long-dated hosting terms matter if pricing and timelines are credible. Source: Core Scientific A Reality Check Before Buying the Narrative Treat each announcement like a data-center deal. Five questions usually do more than a dozen press-release adjectives: What MW is contracted vs. aspirational? How long is the term, and how is pricing framed? Who is the customer/partner, and how strong is the counterparty? How is capex funded—non-dilutive structures or repeated equity issuance? What’s the execution plan to deliver GPU-ready capacity (power, cooling, networking) on schedule? Even if the AI side is real, the crypto side still matters. Hash-price pressure, network difficulty, and spot BTC direction can dominate short windows, and buildouts can stumble if funding tightens or timelines slip. That’s why these stocks can gap down on a Bitcoin drawdown even as they tout multi-year hosting progress. What Are You Really Buying? The hybrid trade’s appeal is obvious: miners try to turn mining-era assets into contracted compute capacity, while traders get a story that can participate in both AI enthusiasm and Bitcoin rallies. But the market hasn’t fully decided how to price that bridge. On some days, it’s MW and multi-year value; on others, it’s pure Bitcoin beta. Watching NVDA alongside the hybrids helps clarify which narrative is in control: compute optimism, or crypto risk. So the question to sit with is simple: if a stock trades like a Bitcoin proxy today but sells itself as a multi-year megawatt lessor, which story will you trust when the next volatility shock stress-tests both at once?

According to their latest on-chain data, wallets holding substantial Bitcoin amounts have been aggressively accumulating the digital asset since December 17th, while retail participants continue selling their positions. This whale accumulation pattern historically precedes notable market movements, offering valuable insights for investors monitoring Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin Whales Demonstrate Strategic Accumulation Pattern Santiment’s comprehensive blockchain analysis reveals a compelling narrative about Bitcoin’s current market structure. Specifically, the platform identified wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC collectively adding 56,227 Bitcoin to their positions during this accumulation phase. These substantial investors, often categorized as whales and sharks within cryptocurrency circles, typically possess sophisticated market insights and substantial resources. Their coordinated buying activity suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition despite recent market volatility. Furthermore, this accumulation represents one of the most significant whale movements observed in the latter half of 2024. The cryptocurrency market frequently follows the strategic movements of these major investors, often moving contrary to retail sentiment patterns. Historical data from previous market cycles demonstrates that whale accumulation during periods of retail selling frequently precedes substantial price appreciation. Santiment’s analysis team emphasizes that this current accumulation phase aligns with traditional indicators of a local market bottom formation. The platform’s tracking methodology monitors wallet movements across multiple blockchain layers, providing a comprehensive view of investor behavior across different market participant categories. Retail Investor Behavior Contrasts Sharply with Whale Activity While Bitcoin whales demonstrate accumulation behavior, retail investors holding less than 0.01 BTC have been actively taking profits throughout the same period. Santiment’s data indicates these smaller wallets have reduced their Bitcoin exposure significantly over the past 24 hours, continuing a trend observed throughout December. This retail selling activity typically reflects different psychological and financial considerations compared to institutional or whale investors. Retail participants often react more strongly to short-term price movements and market sentiment indicators. The divergence between whale accumulation and retail selling creates a classic market dynamic observed in various asset classes throughout financial history. When sophisticated investors accumulate while less experienced participants sell, it frequently indicates a potential reversal point. Santiment’s historical analysis reveals similar patterns preceding Bitcoin’s major bull runs in 2017, 2021, and previous market cycles. The platform’s researchers note that retail selling often represents the final phase of market capitulation before sustained upward movements begin. Expert Analysis of On-Chain Indicators Blockchain analytics experts emphasize that Santiment’s findings align with several traditional market bottom indicators. The accumulation by wallets holding 10-10,000 BTC represents a substantial commitment of capital during a period of market uncertainty. Industry analysts note that whale movements typically precede price movements by several weeks, providing valuable forward-looking signals for market participants. Additionally, the sustained nature of this accumulation suggests strategic positioning rather than short-term trading activity. Market technicians point to complementary indicators supporting Santiment’s interpretation. Exchange reserve data shows decreasing Bitcoin balances on trading platforms, suggesting reduced selling pressure. Network fundamentals, including hash rate stability and active address metrics, remain robust despite price volatility. These technical factors combined with whale accumulation patterns create a compelling case for potential market stabilization. Historical precedent suggests that similar divergence patterns between whale and retail behavior have accurately signaled important market turning points in previous cycles. Comparative Analysis of Investor Categories Investor Category BTC Holdings Range Recent Behavior Market Influence Whales 10,000+ BTC Strategic Accumulation Very High Sharks 100-10,000 BTC Moderate Accumulation High Dolphins 10-100 BTC Mixed Activity Medium Retail Investors Profit Taking/Selling Low Collective The table above illustrates the clear behavioral divergence between different Bitcoin investor categories during this market phase. Whale and shark categories demonstrate accumulation patterns, while retail participants exhibit selling behavior. This divergence creates several important market implications: Supply redistribution from weak to strong hands Reduced exchange liquidity as whales withdraw coins Potential selling pressure reduction as retail exits Increased holding conviction among major stakeholders Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Bitcoin’s market cycles consistently demonstrate similar patterns of whale accumulation during retail capitulation phases. Previous cycles in 2015, 2019, and 2022 exhibited comparable dynamics before significant price appreciation periods. Santiment’s historical data reveals that whale accumulation during market uncertainty frequently precedes substantial rallies. The current accumulation of 56,227 BTC since December 17th represents a meaningful percentage of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, potentially reducing available liquidity for future selling pressure. Market analysts emphasize several key factors supporting the bullish interpretation of current whale behavior. First, macroeconomic conditions in late 2024 show potential improvement for risk assets. Second, Bitcoin’s fundamental network metrics remain strong despite price volatility. Third, institutional adoption continues progressing through regulated investment vehicles. Finally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 creates natural supply reduction dynamics that historically benefit long-term holders. These factors combined create a favorable environment for strategic accumulation by sophisticated investors. Technical and Fundamental Supporting Factors Beyond whale accumulation patterns, several technical indicators support potential market stabilization. The MVRV ratio, which compares market value to realized value, approaches levels historically associated with market bottoms. Exchange netflow metrics show consistent Bitcoin withdrawals from trading platforms, reducing immediate selling pressure. Network activity metrics demonstrate sustained utility despite price declines. These fundamental factors combined with whale accumulation create a compelling case for cautious optimism among long-term Bitcoin investors. Industry experts note that whale movements typically represent strategic rather than speculative positioning. The substantial capital required for accumulating 56,227 BTC suggests institutional-grade decision-making processes. These investors typically employ sophisticated analysis incorporating macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Their accumulation during a period of retail pessimism suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite short-term volatility. This behavioral pattern aligns with traditional investment wisdom about buying when others demonstrate fear. Conclusion Santiment’s December 2024 data reveals a significant divergence between Bitcoin whale accumulation and retail selling activity, potentially signaling an important market inflection point. The coordinated accumulation of 56,227 BTC by wallets holding 10-10,000 Bitcoin suggests sophisticated investor confidence despite ongoing market uncertainty. Historical patterns indicate similar whale accumulation during retail capitulation frequently precedes substantial market movements. While no single indicator guarantees future performance, the combination of whale accumulation, strong network fundamentals, and favorable macroeconomic conditions creates a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Market participants should monitor these on-chain signals alongside traditional technical analysis when evaluating Bitcoin’s investment thesis. FAQs Q1: What exactly defines a Bitcoin whale according to Santiment’s analysis? Santiment categorizes Bitcoin whales as wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, with the largest accumulators typically being institutional investors, exchanges, or early adopters with substantial holdings that can significantly influence market dynamics. Q2: Why is whale accumulation considered bullish when retail investors are selling? Historical data shows that sophisticated investors often accumulate during periods of retail selling, indicating they perceive value at current prices. This supply redistribution from weak to strong hands typically reduces future selling pressure and can precede upward price movements. Q3: How reliable are Santiment’s on-chain metrics for predicting market movements? While no metric guarantees future performance, Santiment’s on-chain data provides valuable insights into investor behavior. Historical patterns show strong correlations between whale accumulation phases and subsequent market movements, though investors should consider multiple factors when making decisions. Q4: What time frame does Santiment’s analysis cover for this whale accumulation data? The reported accumulation of 56,227 BTC occurred specifically since December 17, 2024, representing a concentrated buying period by wallets in the 10-10,000 BTC range during a phase of market uncertainty. Q5: How does retail selling pressure affect Bitcoin’s price when whales are accumulating? Retail selling creates immediate downward pressure, but whale accumulation absorbs this supply. When whales withdraw coins to cold storage, they reduce exchange liquidity, potentially creating supply shocks if demand increases while available coins decrease.

Although the cryptocurrency has recovered slightly and is now trading above $90,000 , a crypto analyst has forecast another major price crash in 2026. According to the forecast, Bitcoin could decline by 50%, following trends observed in previous cycles, potentially hitting a bottom near $40,000. Bitcoin Price Set For 50% Crash Bitcoin could face another price correction as technical indicators continue to signal a strong bear market. Market expert CryptoBullet warns that Bitcoin’s bear market behavior is not over, with a deeper pullback aligning with long-term on-chain trends. CryptoBullet bases his outlook on Bitcoin’s Realized Price , a metric that reflects the average price at which all circulating coins last moved. He explained that this level acts as a key reference during bear markets and has historically marked zones where price eventually breaks down before forming a bottom. Looking at past cycles, he noted that Bitcoin has consistently fallen below its Realized Price during bear markets. The drawdowns reached 66% in 2011, 48% in 2015, 35% in 2018, and 33% in 2022, indicating a consistent tendency for prices to fall below this level. Due to this repeated decline, the analyst believes the next bear-market crash will follow the same pattern, triggering a 50% drop to $40,000 for Bitcoin this year. Another major factor supporting CryptoBullet’s analysis is Bitcoin’s declining volatility over time. He noted that the gap between market price and Realized Price has steadily narrowed, shrinking from a 66% deviation in 2011 to roughly 33% in 2022. Because of this trend, the analyst does not expect the bear market this year to be as severe as the downside observed in past cycles. Instead, he estimates Bitcoin could fall by 24% to 31% below Realized Price, placing its likely bottom in the $40,000 to $43,000 range. Extreme Bear Market Scenario With the Realized Price currently near $56,000, CryptoBullet has also cautioned that Bitcoin could decline even further to below $40,000 this year. The analyst noted that if the market repeats the 2022 bear market , a 33% drop below Realized Price would place Bitcoin near $37,400. He added that by the third quarter or fourth quarter of 2026, Realized Price could fall deeper to $53,000 or $54,000, which could result in a similar 33% crash, pushing Bitcoin closer to $35,000 . The analyst has stated that $35,000 represents the most extreme downside he can reasonably see this year based on historical behavior. The accompanying chart also reflects this view by highlighting previous bear-market crashes that occurred after the price slipped well below the Realized Price line.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoBullet,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56866124,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258653,1767650711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows Reveal the Unvarnished Truth About Market Sentiment, Says Expert",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-bitcoin-etf-market-sentiment-indicator/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows Reveal the Unvarnished Truth About Market Sentiment, Says Expert In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investing, a clear signal has emerged from the noise. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the daily inflow and outflow data from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now serves as a remarkably pure indicator of genuine market sentiment. This insight, shared in March 2025, cuts through the complexity of traditional metrics, offering investors and analysts a direct line to understanding real capital movement. Unlike broader measures that can be clouded by volatility, these net flow figures provide a transparent window into investor conviction and market psychology. Why Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows Are a Critical Market Barometer Financial markets constantly seek reliable indicators. For years, analysts relied heavily on Assets Under Management (AUM) to gauge fund health and investor interest. However, AUM presents a distorted picture for volatile assets like Bitcoin. Its value fluctuates not only with investor deposits and withdrawals but also with the underlying asset’s price. A fund’s AUM can rise significantly during a Bitcoin price surge, even if investors are pulling money out. Conversely, AUM can fall during a price crash, masking simultaneous investor inflows. This inherent flaw makes AUM an imperfect tool for sentiment analysis. Spot Bitcoin ETF net flows solve this problem. They track the actual movement of Bitcoin into and out of the fund’s custody. When an investor buys shares, the issuer must purchase the corresponding amount of Bitcoin. This creates a verifiable on-chain footprint. Seyffart emphasizes that this process makes net flows a direct measure of market activity. It reflects a deliberate investment decision, separate from passive price appreciation. Consequently, analysts now prioritize flow data to separate hype from genuine capital allocation trends. Decoding the Data: Flows Versus AUM in Practice To understand the distinction, consider a practical example. Imagine a spot Bitcoin ETF holds 10,000 BTC when the price is $60,000. Its AUM is $600 million. If the price of Bitcoin jumps 25% to $75,000, the AUM automatically rises to $750 million, suggesting growth. However, if during that price rise, the fund experiences net outflows of 1,000 BTC, the actual investor behavior is negative. The AUM metric, inflated by price, tells a misleading story of success. The net flow data, showing a reduction in Bitcoin holdings, reveals the true sentiment of capital flight. This clarity is vital for several market participants: Institutional Analysts: They use flow data to build predictive models and assess risk. Retail Investors: They gain a clearer view of whether “smart money” is accumulating or distributing. Financial Media: They can report on tangible investment trends rather than just price movements. The table below illustrates the critical difference between the two metrics: Scenario Bitcoin Price Change Net ETF Flow (BTC) AUM Implication True Sentiment (Per Flows) 1 +20% +2,000 BTC Strong Growth Extremely Positive 2 +20% -1,000 BTC Moderate Growth Negative 3 -15% +3,000 BTC Decline Very Positive (Buying the dip) The Analyst’s Perspective: James Seyffart’s Expert Insight James Seyffart’s analysis carries significant weight due to his established expertise in the ETF ecosystem. As a prominent analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, he has tracked the approval process and subsequent performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their inception. His commentary is grounded in daily data monitoring and a deep understanding of both traditional finance and cryptocurrency mechanics. This perspective allows him to identify which metrics truly matter in a nascent and often misunderstood asset class. Seyffart’s point about flow purity connects to broader market transparency goals. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a watershed moment, bridging digital assets with regulated financial markets. These products provided a familiar, secure wrapper for institutional capital. Now, the data they generate is creating a new layer of market intelligence. This intelligence is not speculative; it is based on settled trades and verifiable blockchain transactions, enhancing the overall trustworthiness of cryptocurrency market analysis. The Ripple Effect of Transparent Flow Data The availability of pure sentiment indicators has tangible impacts beyond analysis. First, it influences price discovery. Sustained net inflows into major ETFs can signal strong underlying demand, potentially providing price support. Conversely, prolonged outflows can indicate profit-taking or loss of confidence, often preceding or accompanying price corrections. Market participants now watch weekly flow reports with the same attention once reserved for Federal Reserve announcements. Second, this data affects product competition. Flows are publicly reported for each ETF issuer (e.g., BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC). This creates a transparent leaderboard. Issuers with consistent inflows demonstrate stronger investor trust and better execution, which can attract more capital in a positive feedback loop. Finally, for regulators, clear flow data provides an auditable trail of capital movement. This aids in monitoring for systemic risk and ensures the market operates with greater integrity, aligning with the goals of the 2025 financial oversight framework. Conclusion James Seyffart’s identification of spot Bitcoin ETF flows as a pure market sentiment indicator marks a maturation in cryptocurrency analysis. By moving beyond the noisy, price-distorted metric of Assets Under Management, investors gain access to a clearer signal of real-world capital movement. This flow data acts as a direct gauge of investor conviction, offering unparalleled insight into market psychology. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, such transparent and factual metrics will be crucial for informed decision-making, risk assessment, and the continued integration of cryptocurrency into the global financial mainstream. FAQs Q1: What is the difference between ETF net flows and Assets Under Management (AUM)? A1: Net flows measure the actual movement of assets (like Bitcoin) into and out of a fund. AUM is the total market value of assets held, which changes with both flows and the price of the assets. Flows show investor actions; AUM can be distorted by price swings. Q2: Why are spot Bitcoin ETF flows considered a “pure” indicator? A2: They are considered pure because they directly track investor decisions to allocate or remove capital. They are not influenced by the fluctuating price of Bitcoin itself, isolating the variable of human sentiment from market volatility. Q3: How often is spot Bitcoin ETF flow data reported? A3: Issuers typically report estimated daily flow data. This information is aggregated and published by financial data firms and news outlets, often on a daily or weekly basis, providing a near-real-time pulse on investor sentiment. Q4: Can ETF flow data predict Bitcoin’s price? A4: While not a perfect predictor, sustained trends in flow data can signal underlying supply and demand dynamics. Prolonged heavy inflows often correlate with bullish sentiment and potential price support, while sustained outflows can indicate selling pressure. Q5: Do all types of Bitcoin ETFs provide this clear flow data? A5: The clarity is most pronounced with spot Bitcoin ETFs, which hold actual Bitcoin. Futures-based Bitcoin ETFs involve derivative contracts, adding layers of complexity. The direct custody link in spot ETFs makes their flow data a more straightforward sentiment gauge.

This pivotal move, confirmed on March 15, 2026, signals a potential escape from a prolonged bearish death cross pattern that has shadowed the asset since November 2025, according to a detailed analysis by Decrypt. Bitcoin Price Achieves Critical Technical Milestone Bitcoin’s price action has delivered a crucial bullish signal by closing above its 200-day EMA. Market analysts widely regard this long-term moving average as a primary barometer for an asset’s overall trend health. Consequently, a sustained position above this line typically suggests underlying bullish momentum. This event marks the first instance since October 2025 that Bitcoin has achieved this level, effectively breaking a multi-month pattern of consolidation and decline. The move coincides with a broader recovery trend that began at the outset of 2026, characterized by increasing institutional inflows and positive regulatory clarifications in several key jurisdictions. The Anatomy of the Death Cross and Its Implications A death cross is a technical chart pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average, such as the 50-day, crosses below a long-term moving average like the 200-day. Traders historically interpret this crossover as a bearish signal, indicating potential for further price depreciation. For Bitcoin, this pattern materialized in late November 2025, following a period of market uncertainty. However, technical indicators are not infallible predictors. Their significance often depends on subsequent price confirmation. The recent reclaim of the 200-day EMA now challenges the bearish narrative established by the death cross, suggesting weakening selling pressure and a potential trend reversal. Decrypt Analysis Highlights Key Market Dynamics The analysis from Decrypt provided granular insight into the day’s trading activity. It specifically highlighted the structure of the daily candlestick that accomplished the breakout. This candle closed with a “full body” and minimal upper or lower “wicks,” a formation that technical traders interpret as strong, consensus-driven buying pressure with little rejection at higher prices. Furthermore, this powerful candle closed above a previously identified key resistance level, adding confluence to the bullish argument. The convergence of these factors—breaking a major moving average, overcoming resistance, and doing so with a strong candlestick pattern—creates a compelling case for a shift in market structure. Key technical terms explained: Exponential Moving Average (EMA): A type of moving average that gives greater weight to recent price data, making it more responsive to new information. Death Cross: A bearish technical signal where a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term one. Golden Cross: The opposite, bullish signal, where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one. Bitcoin Key Moving Average Snapshot (March 15, 2026) Indicator Value Status vs. Price Significance 50-Day EMA $72,400 Price Above Short-term bullish 200-Day EMA $74,150 Price Recently Reclaimed Long-term trend shift Death Cross Formed Nov 28, 2025 Pattern Potentially Invalidating Bearish signal weakening Contextualizing the 2026 Recovery Trend The current price action does not exist in a vacuum. It forms part of a broader recovery narrative that started in January 2026. Several fundamental factors support this trend. First, clarity on cryptocurrency custody and trading regulations from major economies has reduced institutional hesitation. Second, the continued adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset by publicly listed companies provides consistent buy-side pressure. Finally, macroeconomic conditions, including evolving monetary policy, have renewed interest in Bitcoin’s perceived value as a hedge against currency debasement. This confluence of technical and fundamental drivers strengthens the case for the current move’s sustainability. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure Shifts While Decrypt’s report focuses on the chart patterns, veteran traders emphasize the importance of volume and time. A single daily close above the 200-day EMA, while notable, requires follow-through. Analysts will now watch to see if Bitcoin can maintain this level for several consecutive days and if trading volume remains elevated during any consolidation. Historically, the most reliable trend changes occur when price reclaims a key average and then uses it as support for further advances. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this breakout represents a genuine trend reversal or a temporary relief rally within a larger corrective phase. Conclusion Bitcoin’s successful reclaim of the 200-day exponential moving average represents a major technical achievement with significant implications for market sentiment. This move directly challenges the bearish death cross pattern that formed in late 2025 and aligns with a fundamental recovery trend underway since early 2026. While prudent market participants await confirmation through sustained price action above this level, the breakout, characterized by a strong daily candle, undeniably shifts the near-term bias from bearish to cautiously bullish. The Bitcoin price action in the coming sessions will be paramount in validating this potential escape from the previous death cross pattern. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Bitcoin reclaimed the 200-day EMA? A1: Reclaiming the 200-day Exponential Moving Average means Bitcoin’s price has risen back above this key long-term trend indicator. Analysts often view this as a sign that the overall market trend may be shifting from bearish to bullish, as it suggests buying pressure is overcoming previous selling momentum. Q2: What is a death cross pattern in cryptocurrency trading? A2: A death cross is a technical analysis pattern that appears on a price chart. It occurs when a shorter-term moving average (like the 50-day) crosses below a longer-term moving average (like the 200-day). This event is traditionally interpreted as a bearish signal, potentially forecasting further price declines. Q3: Does breaking above the 200-day EMA guarantee Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise? A3: No, it does not guarantee further rises. While it is a strong bullish signal, it requires confirmation. Traders look for the price to hold above the average for multiple days and for increased trading volume to support the move. It is one important piece of evidence within a broader market analysis. Q4: How long had Bitcoin been below its 200-day EMA before this breakout? A4: According to the analysis, Bitcoin had been trading below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average since October 2025. Therefore, the recent breakout ends approximately a five-month period of trading below this significant technical level. Q5: What is the difference between a simple moving average (SMA) and an exponential moving average (EMA)? A5: Both are trend-following indicators. A Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculates the average price over a set period, giving equal weight to all data points. An Exponential Moving Average (EMA) also calculates an average but applies more weight to the most recent prices. This makes the EMA more responsive to recent price changes compared to the SMA.

This market rally comes on the back of several factors, including the U.S.-Venezuela escalations, which have increased risk sentiment. Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Up In an X post, market commentator The Kobeissi Letter noted that risky assets seem to be gaining momentum despite the U.S. capture of former Venezuelan president Maduro. This suggests risk sentiment may be back after the year-end decline in 2025, which has contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. Related Reading: Here’s How Much BlackRock Spent Buying Bitcoin And Ethereum In 2025 The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are also rising on the back of an increase in the M2 money supply, which now stands at $22.4 trillion, according to data from the St. Louis Fed. This is bullish for crypto assets as some of this liquidity is expected to flow into the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, the U.S. debt continues to rise, standing at $38.6 trillion, a development that is bullish for crypto as investors hedge against inflation by allocating to these asset classes. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Fed has also been carrying out its Reserve Management Purchases (RMP), which experts such as James Lavish have described as a form of quantitative easing (QE), which is positive for the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has even predicted that BTC could rally to as high as $200,000 on the back of this move from the Fed. Meanwhile, the Fed has also been injecting liquidity into the economy through the New York Fed’s repo operations. Crypto Bulls Are Back In Control Market analyst Ted Pilliows also suggested that the crypto bulls are back in control, which is why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising. In an X post, he noted that BTC has large sell orders from the $92,000 to $95,000 level on Binance. Ted added that if bulls push BTC above the $95,000 level, there is very little resistance until $100,000, suggesting a rally to this psychological level could be on the cards. Related Reading: Dogecoin Reclaiming $0.128 Support Could Signal The Perfect Chance For Long Positions In another X post, the market analyst noted that the Coinbase Bitcoin premium is recovering, with institutional demand for BTC picking up again. SoSoValue data show that Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $471.14 million on January 2, their largest since December 17. A sustained daily net inflow could lead to higher prices for BTC, which is also a positive for the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $92,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The period leading up to Christmas could be an ideal opportunity for investors to increase their crypto exposure. Bitcoin ($BTC) is currently trading below the $94,000 mark in an early sign of strong rebound potential after it spent most of Q4 trading sideways. Another notable trend is Bitcoin’s gradual decline in market dominance since the summer. Historically, this often signals capital flowing from Bitcoin to altcoins. In this environment, cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Pepe, and Bonk may offer some of the strongest growth potential in the coming year. XRP (XRP): Bringing Global Payments On Chain Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to play a major role in cross-border payments thanks to near-instant transactions and minimal fees. Designed to modernize global payments, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) provides a faster, cheaper alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. XRP’s utility is mentioned in reports from the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. Supported by Ripple’s growing fintech partnerships, XRP has become the third-largest cryptocurrency outside stablecoins, with a market cap exceeding $131 billion. After finally resolving its prolonged legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission early last year, XRP hit its first all-time high (ATH) in seven years: $3.65. Since then, it has retraced about 41% and currently trades near $2.19. In the last seven days, XRP exploded 17% thanks to recent momentum from the launch of five spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. that have opened the floodgates for institutional investment. Moving forward, further ETF approvals and regulatory clarity early this year could act as catalysts, potentially pushing XRP to a $10 target by the end of the year. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Coin Momentum Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly became the third biggest meme coin, riding the popularity of Matt Furie’s iconic webcomic character. With a market cap just shy of $3 billion, PEPE has a strong cultural presence, boosted when Elon Musk briefly set his X profile picture to a Pepe meme, fueling speculation about his involvement in meme coins. Currently trading around $0.000006843, PEPE sits about 76% below its late-2024 peak of $0.00002803, following a quiet summer and subdued fourth quarter. Its RSI of 76 suggests the token is overbought after Pepe exploded 68% in the last seven days. This new price burst puts Pepe above strong support levels at $0.000006. Although in the near-term, Pepe is likely to fall overnight while traders cash in on the last week, the token has strongly consolidated its price around current levels. If 2026 evolves into a bull market, PEPE could see serious interest, potentially setting a new ATH by the end of the quarter. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin on the Rise Bonk ($BONK) , Solana’s dog-themed meme coin, launched on December 25, 2022, igniting a holiday rally that boosted Solana ($SOL) by 34% in just two days, cementing BONK’s role in the ecosystem ever since. Currently priced at $0.00001186, BONK charts suggest it could quadruple or quintuple before year-end. Bonk’s staggering $1 billion market cap makes it the third biggest meme coin in Solana, and it’s just a hair’s breadth away from flipping the Official Trump ($TRUMP) coin to lead the sector. Beyond entertainment, people in Solana’s DeFi sector actually use this meme coin for tipping, micropayments, bot-based trading, and NFT collateral. A falling wedge pattern from late November to mid-March foreshadowed Bonk’s July breakout, which saw it peak at $0.00003906 before pulling back alongside the broader meme coin market. If favorable market conditions return, BONK could push beyond resistance levels at $0.00003 and $0.00005. While still 80% below its ATH of $0.00005825 from November 2024, renewed momentum in the crypto market could see it challenge its ATH by Spring. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 One emerging project generating buzz for 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 solution cosplaying as a meme coin. Despite its playful image, HYPER focuses on high-speed throughput, ultra-low fees, and smart contract functionality. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge for seamless Bitcoin movement across chains. The presale has raised over $30 million, and analysts project the token could potentially see 100× gains upon exchange listing. A recent Coinsult audit found no contract vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. HYPER tokens power transaction fees, governance, and staking, with presale participants earning up to 39% APY. The platform will launch in 2026, providing both experienced Bitcoin users and newcomers with an early opportunity in a project that could significantly enhance Bitcoin’s utility.

His statement marks a pivotal claim for the ecosystem, asserting that this breakthrough is no longer theoretical but is being realized through live technology on the network. Live Upgrades Shift Ethereum’s Network Design In a detailed post shared on X on January 3, Buterin argued that the rollout of PeerDAS on Ethereum’s mainnet, combined with zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (ZK-EVMs) reaching the alpha stage, has changed what the network can do in practice. “The trilemma has been solved—not on paper, but with live running code,” he wrote. Buterin also noted that data availability sampling is already active, while ZK-EVMs have reached “production-quality performance,” with safety work still ongoing. He compared Ethereum’s current structure with earlier peer-to-peer systems such as BitTorrent, which he said offered high bandwidth but lacked consensus, and Bitcoin, which he claimed had achieved strong consensus and decentralization at the cost of throughput. According to the developer, with PeerDAS and ZK-EVMs, Ethereum now combines all three, allowing high bandwidth without central control. He described the shift as “not minor improvements” but a move toward “a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network.” Buterin’s post also outlined a multi-year roadmap. He expects larger gas limit increases in 2026, early opportunities to run ZK-EVM nodes, and further adjustments through 2030 as ZK-EVMs become a primary way to validate blocks. He added that distributed block building is still a longer-term goal to reduce central points of control in transaction ordering. Community reaction reflected both excitement and debate. CryptoSensei wrote that these changes “aren’t incremental tweaks” and stressed that PeerDAS being live makes the claims harder to dismiss as theory. However, others, like Solana developer Mert Mumtaz, dismissed the blockchain trilemma as an outdated concept. “It is not a real thing. the trilemma does not actually exist today,” he said on X. Why Decentralization Still Matters The Ethereum architect’s comments follow earlier warnings about centralization risks. In his New Year’s message, he said the blockchain’s future depends not just on upgrades but on keeping decentralization and usability intact as it grows. That concern gained traction in 2025, a year marked by major upgrades such as Pectra and Fusaka, but also by criticism that Ethereum increasingly relied on layer-2 networks and large staking operators. Market performance added to the tension, with the price of the network’s native ETH token lagging in 2025 despite higher usage, institutional interest, and record development activity, fueling doubts about whether technical progress alone can translate into investor confidence. Analysts say Buterin’s latest message reframes the discussion. Rather than arguing about short-term price moves, it places focus on whether Ethereum can support large-scale applications without censorship, downtime, or excessive costs. As Daniel Tschinkel pointed out in a recent social post, users ultimately trust systems that work consistently and predictably.

The unusual situation where Republican appointees now hold sole authority at both financial regulatory agencies follows Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s recent departure from the SEC, leaving the commission without Democratic representation for the first time in recent history. SEC Republican Control Reshapes Regulatory Landscape The Securities and Exchange Commission’s current composition represents a dramatic shift in regulatory philosophy. Commissioner Crenshaw, known for her consumer protection advocacy and cautious approach to cryptocurrency products including spot Bitcoin ETFs, resigned last week. Consequently, the SEC now operates with exclusively Republican-appointed commissioners. This development creates immediate implications for pending enforcement decisions and rulemaking processes. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission faces a parallel situation with President Donald Trump’s appointee Michael Selig leading alone. Both agencies now lack the bipartisan balance that typically characterizes financial regulation in the United States. Historical context reveals this situation’s uniqueness. Traditionally, these commissions maintain balanced political representation to ensure regulatory stability. The current configuration breaks from established norms. Financial regulation experts note that such single-party control rarely persists for extended periods. However, the timing coincides with crucial cryptocurrency legislation debates. Senate committees currently review multiple comprehensive digital asset bills. These proposals address market structure, consumer protection, and jurisdictional clarity between agencies. Crypto Regulation Bills Face Negotiation Challenges Senate negotiations on cryptocurrency legislation now confront unexpected complications. Democratic leadership insists that agency vacancies must receive Democratic nominees before advancing regulatory bills. This position creates procedural hurdles for legislation requiring bipartisan support. Republicans, conversely, view the current configuration as an opportunity to advance market-friendly policies. The resulting dynamic creates uncertainty around legislative timelines and potential compromises. Several key bills currently under consideration include: The Digital Asset Market Structure Act – Clarifies SEC and CFTC jurisdiction The Consumer Digital Protection Act – Establishes disclosure requirements The Stablecoin Transparency Act – Regulates payment stablecoins Each proposal requires careful negotiation between parties. The current agency control situation adds complexity to these discussions. Democrats express concern about proceeding without regulatory balance. Republicans emphasize the need for regulatory clarity to support innovation. This fundamental disagreement could delay legislative progress significantly. Historical Precedents and Political Dynamics Political science experts point to historical parallels in financial regulation. Similar situations occurred during previous administrations with varying outcomes. The 2008 financial crisis prompted bipartisan cooperation despite political differences. Current cryptocurrency regulation debates may follow different patterns. Market participants express mixed reactions to the developments. Some industry representatives welcome potential regulatory clarity. Consumer advocates voice concerns about protection mechanisms. President Trump previously addressed the nomination issue directly. He questioned whether Democrats would appoint Republicans under reversed circumstances. However, he expressed openness to power-sharing arrangements in certain areas. This statement suggests potential negotiation pathways. The White House maintains that nominations should reflect bipartisan considerations. Congressional leaders continue discussions about appropriate solutions. Impact on Digital Asset Policy Development The regulatory environment for digital assets faces immediate and long-term implications. Short-term effects include potential enforcement discretion shifts. Longer-term consequences involve rulemaking priorities and interpretive guidance. Market participants monitor several key areas for potential changes: Regulatory Area Potential Impact Timeline Enforcement Priorities Shift toward market integrity focus Immediate Rulemaking Agenda Accelerated consideration of pending proposals 3-6 months Interpretive Guidance Clarification on security vs. commodity status 6-12 months International Coordination Continued engagement with global regulators Ongoing International regulatory developments add another layer of complexity. Global standard-setting bodies continue cryptocurrency policy discussions. The United States’ internal regulatory dynamics influence its international positioning. Foreign regulators observe American developments closely. Many jurisdictions await clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks before finalizing their own approaches. Expert Perspectives on Regulatory Balance Former regulators emphasize the importance of balanced perspectives. Multiple viewpoints typically produce more robust regulatory frameworks. Single-party control risks creating policy instability. Future administrations might reverse or modify decisions. This uncertainty could hinder long-term investment and innovation. Academic researchers note that regulatory predictability supports healthy market development. Sudden policy shifts create compliance challenges for industry participants. Legal scholars highlight constitutional considerations. Agency structures typically incorporate bipartisan elements by design. Extended single-party control may prompt congressional responses. Legislative solutions could include statutory requirements for balanced representation. Historical examples demonstrate Congress’s authority to reshape agency composition. Current discussions may include such structural considerations. Conclusion Republican control of both the SEC and CFTC creates a critical new variable for cryptocurrency regulation bills moving through Congress. This unprecedented situation impacts Senate negotiations, regulatory priorities, and market expectations. The development follows Commissioner Crenshaw’s departure and leaves both agencies without Democratic representation. While potentially favorable for certain pro-crypto policies, this configuration complicates legislative progress. Democrats insist on balanced nominations before advancing bills. Republicans seek regulatory clarity to support innovation. The resulting dynamic creates uncertainty around cryptocurrency legislation timelines and outcomes. Market participants, regulators, and policymakers must navigate this complex landscape carefully. The SEC Republican control situation represents a significant development in digital asset regulation with far-reaching implications for the financial system’s future structure. FAQs Q1: What does Republican control of the SEC and CFTC mean for cryptocurrency regulation? Republican control means both financial regulatory agencies currently operate with exclusively Republican-appointed commissioners. This situation creates potential for more market-friendly policies but complicates bipartisan legislation negotiations in Congress. Q2: How did this situation develop at the SEC and CFTC? The situation developed following SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation last week. She was the last Democratic commissioner at the SEC. At the CFTC, President Trump’s appointee Michael Selig now leads the commission alone without Democratic counterparts. Q3: What impact does this have on cryptocurrency bills in the Senate? The situation creates negotiation challenges for cryptocurrency regulation bills. Democrats insist on filling vacancies with their nominees before advancing legislation. This could delay bills requiring bipartisan support for passage. Q4: How long might this single-party control situation last? The duration depends on nomination and confirmation processes. Historically, such situations typically resolve within months as administrations nominate and Congress confirms new commissioners to restore balance. Q5: What are the potential consequences for cryptocurrency markets? Markets may experience regulatory uncertainty during this period. However, some industry participants welcome potential clarity on regulatory approaches. The situation’s ultimate impact depends on legislative outcomes and agency actions.

The upgrade is an overhaul of the altcoin’s consensus mechanism, targeting sub-second finality by allowing validators to aggregate votes off-chain before submitting final confirmations. Solana is preparing a major consensus upgrade called Alpenglow, targeting sub-second finality. Alpenglow replaces Tower BFT + PoH with two new components: • Votor (vote aggregation) • Rotor (stake-weighted block propagation) Finality latency could drop from 12.8s → 100–150ms.… pic.twitter.com/8llTYRY7qa — VAYLA (@vaylamanager) January 5, 2026 Under this model, blocks can finalize in just one to two confirmation rounds, cutting theoretical finality latency to 100–150 milliseconds — 100x faster than the original 12.8 seconds. This leap in performance makes the Solana blockchain a more attractive platform for mainstream use cases, while strengthening demand for SOL as the asset powering those use cases. As a closer match to the throughput demands of traditional financial infrastructure, Solana becomes a more likely host to bridge TradFi and DeFi. The network has already emerged as the go-to for tokenised equity, and a performance advantage only stands to position it as a stronger competitor to leading Ethereum layer-2s like Ondo.

Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Reach $10,000? With this strong fundamental backbone, Solana may have finally found the footing needed to realise a year-long bullish descending triangle setup. Price action already hints at a breakout attempt. The lower boundary around $145 has once again acted as a reliable launchpad, triggering a decisive bounce. Source: TradingView Momentum indicators are now rotating back toward bull-market conditions as the two-month downtrend has been broken. The RSI has made a clean move above the 50 neutral line for the first time since October, while the MACD continues to widen above the signal line, suggesting bulls are regaining control of the prevailing trend. The key breakout level remains historical resistance at $210. A successful flip of this zone into support would establish a higher base and open the door to a measured 265% breakout move toward $500. If the Alpenglow upgrade proves to be a catalyst for deeper institutional adoption of the Solana blockchain, a larger 625% move toward $1,000 could follow. Longer term, should Solana cement itself as core infrastructure for mainstream financial institutions, an almost 100x move toward $10,000 may be in the cards. Bitcoin Hyper: Solana Might Be the Wrong Blockchain to Watch Those who chose Solana as their TradFi bet may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Whatever Solana does, Bitcoin will soon be able to do too. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale, and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

After weeks of sideways movement, SOL has pushed higher, reclaiming levels that had previously capped upside attempts. Related Reading: 600,000 Bitcoin Allegedly Held In Venezuelan Shadow Reserve: Report The move comes amid broader strength across major cryptos and follows a period where Solana’s on-chain activity and network upgrades have reshaped how the market views the asset. With price holding above a critical support zone, market participants are now watching whether momentum can sustain a deeper recovery. Solana Price Holds Above Key Levels as Momentum Builds Solana ( SOL) is currently trading above the $135 mark, extending gains of just over 1% in the past 24 hours. The price has successfully defended the $130–$135 zone, an area that previously acted as resistance during consolidation. A break above $132 and the 100-hour simple moving average signaled a short-term trend shift, allowing buyers to push the price as high as $138 before a modest pullback. Technical indicators point to improving momentum. The Relative Strength Index remains above 50, suggesting buying pressure outweighs selling interest, while the hourly MACD continues to strengthen in bullish territory. A rising trend line around $135 now serves as near-term support, with additional downside protection near $130. Failure to hold this level could expose SOL to a deeper retracement toward $128 or $120, but for now, the structure favors stability. On the upside, resistance remains clustered between $138 and $145. A sustained close above $145 would likely open the door to a move toward the $150–$155 range, a zone last tested during previous rally attempts. On-Chain Activity Signals a Structural Shift Beyond price action, Solana’s on-chain metrics continue to draw attention. In 2025, the network processed roughly $1.6 trillion in on-chain spot trading volume, accounting for about 12% of total spot activity across crypto markets. This represents a sharp increase from just a few years ago, when Solana played a minor role in trading flows. The shift highlights a broader trend toward high-throughput blockchains as traders and applications prioritize speed and lower transaction costs. Growing stablecoin usage and decentralized exchange activity on Solana have helped anchor liquidity on-chain, reducing reliance on centralized platforms. Network Upgrades Support the Broader Outlook Solana’s technical progress also underpins the recent price resilience. The rollout of the Firedancer validator client aims to improve transaction processing and network stability, addressing concerns linked to past congestion and outages. Alongside increased block space and compute capacity, these upgrades are designed to support higher activity without significant fee pressure. As Solana expands across payments, NFTs, gaming, and prediction markets, its usage base has become more diversified.

The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sold 57.55 Bitcoin, worth approximately $6.36 million, which was seized from the cryptocurrency mixing service Samourai Wallet. Consequently, this action may directly contravene a standing executive order from the Trump administration. Executive Order 14233 mandates that Bitcoin obtained through federal forfeitures should enter a national strategic reserve instead of being liquidated on the open market. US Marshals Bitcoin Sale: The Core Transaction The U.S. Marshals Service executed the sale of 57.55 BTC in late April 2025. This Bitcoin originated from a seizure conducted in November 2024 against Samourai Wallet. Samourai Wallet is a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet and mixing service. Law enforcement agencies frequently target such services for alleged facilitation of money laundering. The USMS, which manages the Justice Department’s Asset Forfeiture Program, routinely disposes of seized assets. However, this particular sale has drawn scrutiny due to existing presidential directives. According to public forfeiture records and reporting by Bitcoin Magazine, the Marshals transferred the Bitcoin to a registered exchange. The sale proceeded through standard government auction channels. Traditionally, proceeds from such sales fund various law enforcement activities. Nevertheless, a 2020 executive order created a notable exception for Bitcoin specifically. Trump Executive Order Bitcoin: EO 14233 Explained President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14233, “Establishing a National Strategic Digital Asset Reserve,” in September 2020. The order emerged during a period of growing national interest in cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. Its primary stipulation is clear: federal agencies must deposit Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil forfeiture proceedings into a U.S. Treasury-managed reserve. The order’s stated rationale centered on national economic security and maintaining technological competitiveness. Key objectives included: Preserving Value: Holding Bitcoin as a non-monetary reserve asset to hedge against currency devaluation. Technological Sovereignty: Ensuring the U.S. maintains a position in the foundational technology of digital assets. Operational Security: Avoiding market disruption from large, sudden government sell-offs. The order directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General, to establish protocols for the reserve’s management. It explicitly prohibited the immediate sale of forfeited Bitcoin unless under declared national emergencies. Legal Precedents and Policy Implementation Since its signing, EO 14233’s implementation has been inconsistent. Several high-profile seizures, like those from the Silk Road case, occurred before the order. Subsequent seizures, however, fell under its purview. For example, the 2022 seizure of Bitcoin from the Bitfinex hack led to a protracted legal debate. Ultimately, those funds were sold, but only after a specific congressional appropriation overrode the executive order for that instance. Legal experts note that executive orders carry the force of law for the executive branch. However, they can be superseded by subsequent legislation or conflicting agency mandates. The Department of Justice’s Asset Forfeiture Policy Manual was updated in 2021 to reference EO 14233. It created a multi-agency review panel for cryptocurrency seizures. The apparent bypass of this panel for the Samourai Wallet sale forms the core of the current controversy. Samourai Wallet Seizure: Background and Forfeiture Process Federal authorities targeted Samourai Wallet in a coordinated action in November 2024. The Department of Justice unsealed indictments against its founders. Charges included conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Agents alleged the service processed over $100 million in illicit transactions from darknet markets. As part of the enforcement action, the government seized the service’s domain and backend servers. Critically, they also seized a Bitcoin wallet containing 57.55 BTC identified as fees collected by the service. The forfeiture process moved quickly. By February 2025, a federal judge had signed a final order of forfeiture, transferring legal title of the Bitcoin to the U.S. government. The timeline is crucial: Date Event Nov 2024 Seizure of Samourai Wallet assets by law enforcement. Feb 2025 Judicial forfeiture order granted. Apr 2025 USMS sells 57.55 BTC on the open market. May 2025 Bitcoin Magazine reports potential EO violation. This rapid liquidation contrasts with other cases where seized crypto has been held for years during legal proceedings. Cryptocurrency Forfeiture Policy: A Patchwork of Protocols The handling of seized digital assets remains a complex and evolving challenge for federal agencies. Different agencies operate under slightly different rules. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation division often holds seized crypto as evidence for longer periods. Conversely, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has specific protocols for immediate conversion to fiat currency in certain drug cases. The U.S. Marshals Service has been the primary disposal agent for the DOJ since 2014. They have conducted numerous auctions of Bitcoin. However, EO 14233 was designed to create a uniform, government-wide policy favoring retention. The apparent discrepancy suggests either a breakdown in inter-agency communication, a deliberate policy interpretation, or an oversight. Several factors complicate compliance: Volatility: Agencies fear being responsible for a decline in asset value if held. Custody: Secure, insured custody of large Bitcoin sums presents logistical hurdles. Legal Uncertainty: The order’s status under the current administration is ambiguous. Expert Analysis on the Breach Allegation Constitutional law scholars and former federal prosecutors have weighed in on the potential violation. Professor Eleanor Vance of Georgetown Law Center stated, “Executive orders are binding on the agencies within the executive branch unless revoked or found unconstitutional. The Marshals Service is part of the DOJ, which is under the President’s authority. Therefore, a prima facie case exists that this sale violated a standing order.” Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chen, who specialized in cybercrime, offered a different perspective. “In practice,” Chen explained, “the forfeiture unit’s primary mandate is to convert illicit assets into funds for victim restitution and law enforcement budgets. There is inherent tension between that operational mandate and a strategic reserve order. Someone at the Marshals Service likely made a judgment call based on immediate operational needs versus a broader, older policy.” Blockchain forensic firms have tracked the sold Bitcoin. Analysis shows the funds moved to a known exchange deposit address. They were then broken into smaller lots and sold on the market over 48 hours. This sale method is standard for the USMS to minimize market impact. Potential Impacts and Government Response The revelation of the sale has triggered several potential consequences. Congressional oversight committees have reportedly begun inquiries. Staffers from the House Financial Services Committee have requested documents from the USMS and Treasury regarding the decision-making process. The outcome could influence future cryptocurrency-related legislation. Furthermore, legal challenges are possible. Defendants in the Samourai Wallet case or other forfeiture cases could cite this sale as evidence of arbitrary or capricious enforcement of forfeiture laws. They might argue the government selectively follows its own rules. Market analysts also note a minor point. The sale of $6.36 million in Bitcoin is negligible for the overall market. However, the precedent matters. If the government routinely sells forfeited Bitcoin instead of holding it, it represents a constant, small sell-side pressure. Conversely, building a strategic reserve would represent a long-term holder, potentially supporting price stability. As of this reporting, the U.S. Marshals Service has not issued a public statement. A Department of Justice spokesperson provided a standard response: “The U.S. Marshals Service complies with all applicable laws and policies in the disposal of forfeited assets. We do not comment on specific transactions.” The Treasury Department, tasked with managing the strategic reserve, has also declined to comment. Conclusion The U.S. Marshals Service’s sale of $6.36 million in seized Bitcoin has exposed a significant rift in federal digital asset policy. This action appears to conflict with the directives of Executive Order 14233, which requires such assets to bolster a national strategic reserve. The situation highlights the ongoing struggle to create coherent and consistently applied cryptocurrency forfeiture policy. It raises critical questions about inter-agency coordination, the enduring force of previous administrative orders, and the nation’s long-term strategic approach to Bitcoin. The resolution of this controversy will likely set a critical precedent for how the U.S. government manages seized cryptocurrency assets for years to come. FAQs Q1: What is Executive Order 14233? Executive Order 14233, signed by President Donald Trump in 2020, directs that Bitcoin seized by the U.S. government through forfeiture be placed into a “National Strategic Digital Asset Reserve” managed by the Treasury Department, rather than being immediately sold at auction. Q2: Why did the U.S. Marshals sell the seized Bitcoin? The U.S. Marshals Service routinely sells forfeited assets to generate funds for victim restitution, law enforcement operations, and other government programs. The agency likely followed its standard operational procedures, potentially overlooking or interpreting the 2020 executive order differently. Q3: What was Samourai Wallet? Samourai Wallet was a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet and “mixer” or “tumbler” service. Federal authorities alleged it was used to launder money from illegal activities, leading to the seizure of its assets, including the 57.55 BTC in question, in November 2024. Q4: Could this sale be reversed or corrected? It is highly unlikely the sale itself could be reversed, as the Bitcoin has been sold on the open market. However, the government could theoretically purchase an equivalent amount of Bitcoin for the strategic reserve, or future policy could be clarified to prevent similar actions. Q5: Does this mean the strategic reserve doesn’t exist? The status of the National Strategic Digital Asset Reserve is unclear. Executive Order 14233 called for its creation, but there have been no public disclosures about its size, holdings, or management structure, leading to questions about its operational reality.

A breakout above a key trend line resistance now supports a bullish XRP price prediction for the weeks ahead. Buying pressure is rising fast, with trading volume up 21% in the past 24 hours, representing 2.6% of the token’s circulating market cap. After five straight days of green candles, XRP has broken its bearish structure, opening the door for a potential rally if the trend continues. Meanwhile, market sentiment has been improving. The Fear and Greed Index has already reached 42 and has entered Neutral territory after hitting a record low of 11 (Extreme Panic) in late November. XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also received a strong wave of inflows since their launch in the U.S. These vehicles already managed to bring in positive inflows for 33 consecutive days. This is also a positive indication that investors are piling into the token. At the time of writing, the combined amount of assets held in these vehicles has increased to $1.2 billion. Wall Street’s strong interest in XRP could have built up the necessary floor for this token to climb to new heights. XRP Price Prediction: Move to $3 Seems Likely After Major Bullish Breakout The daily chart indicates that XRP has just broken out of its descending price channel. The $1.95 area was a critical structural level that had previously kept a lid on XRP. Source: TradingView With the price now nearing $2.20, the token’s bearish price structure has been invalidated. XRP could now find support at $1.95 in the next few days to build its first leg. As long as that support area holds, we could witness a strong move to $3 in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has sent a strong buy signal after rising above the 14-day moving average and pushing past the mid-line. As positive momentum continues to build, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could see the greatest rallies.

PwC Has Softened Its Stance On Crypto According to a report from the Financial Times, PwC has changed its strategy around digital assets following the new laws passed by Donald Trump’s administration. PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC in short, is a multinational professional services network headquartered in London. It provides services such as audits, tax planning, and business consulting to companies worldwide. PwC is the second-largest firm of its kind and part of the Big Four accounting firms. Previously, the British company steered clear of crypto-related work in the US like other Big Four firms, but it seems that stance has now changed. The shift has come as the US has made advancements in its crypto regulatory framework. Among the new laws is the Genius Act , which regulates stablecoins, digital assets pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar (USD). “The Genius Act and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin, I expect, will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class,” said Paul Griggs, senior partner at PwC US, in an interview with FT. Griggs added that PwC has been pitching companies on how they can use digital asset technology, with stablecoins as a means of improving payment systems’ efficiency, cited as one example. PwC and other Big Four firms budging on crypto showcases the legislative momentum that the industry has had recently, with traditional finance increasingly unable to ignore the sector. Stablecoins, in particular, have been witnessing growing adoption. Beyond the American Genius Act, this class of digital assets also attracted regulatory attention in other parts of the world. Hong Kong introduced a stablecoin issuer licensing framework last year, while Japan observed the launch of its first yen-based token . In Europe, major banks have come together to work on a euro-pegged coin, aiming to challenge the sector’s USD dominance. The positive regulation in 2025 meant that the space witnessed some sharp growth, with the market cap exploring new records, as data from DefiLlama shows. The sector hasn’t been unaffected by the wider slowdown in crypto since October, however. From the above chart, it’s visible that the stablecoin market cap has seen consolidation in the last few months. Nonetheless, while other parts of the market have shrunken, these fiat-tied tokens still have their combined market cap sitting at $307 billion today, which is very close to the all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $92,900, up nearly 6% over the last week.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|PwC|PwC Crypto|US crypto|US crypto regulation,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This renewed confidence follows XRP’s recent recovery above the $2 level, a milestone it had previously lost in mid-December. Market commentator Matt Hughes, known online as The Great Mattsby, recently endorsed this view, aligning himself with a long-standing projection from technical analyst Charting Guy. According to Hughes, recent price developments reinforce the argument that XRP’s broader trend remains intact, even as short-term market sentiment fluctuates. Renewed Momentum Above Key Psychological Levels XRP’s latest price action has drawn increased attention after the asset reclaimed the $2 threshold for the first time in 2026. At the time of reporting, XRP is currently trading around $2 , marking its highest level so far this year. The move followed an approximate 8% increase over 24 hours, lifting its weekly performance into positive territory. Although XRP’s monthly performance still reflects a modest decline, analysts note that reclaiming and holding above $2 could represent an important shift in momentum. Establishing this area as support is viewed as a prerequisite for any sustained upside movement. As a result, some market observers believe the recent breakout could signal the early stages of a broader trend continuation. It’s true $XRP https://t.co/qDj7Q9HWQq — The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) January 2, 2026 Long-Term Technical Structure Remains Constructive According to Charting Guy’s analysis, XRP has been developing within a large-scale bullish framework that began forming several years ago. Rather than experiencing prolonged breakdowns after major rallies, the asset has tended to enter extended consolidation periods. These phases, which often last many months, have historically preceded significant upward expansions. Past market behavior suggests a recurring pattern in which XRP consolidates following major price advances before resuming its upward trajectory. One notable example occurred in late 2024, when XRP broke out after a prolonged range and surged into early 2025. That rally carried the price beyond $3 before peaking near $3.66 later in the year. While a substantial correction followed, analysts argue that such pullbacks are consistent with previous cycles and do not necessarily invalidate the broader trend. Instead, they view the recent stabilization as part of a reset phase ahead of another potential advance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rationale Behind the $8 Projection The $8 target remains central to Charting Guy’s thesis due to several overlapping technical considerations. These include historical price symmetry, measured move projections, and Fibonacci extension levels observed on higher timeframes. In particular, the $8 area corresponds with a key extension level that has previously aligned with major market tops during earlier cycles. Supporters of this viewpoint point to XRP’s past rallies, which have often unfolded in sharp, multi-week advances separated by periods of consolidation. From current levels, a move to $8 would represent a rise of just under 300%, a scale that proponents argue is consistent with XRP’s historical volatility during strong market phases. Broader Analyst Consensus and Market Commentary Hughes’ public agreement with the $8 projection has added visibility to the forecast. While he did not expand extensively on the timeline, his endorsement signals alignment among analysts who believe XRP’s current structure supports further upside. Other market participants have floated higher targets, including levels above $10 or even $20. Charting Guy has acknowledged these possibilities but has clarified that his primary focus remains on the $8 level as the next major objective. He has stated that higher prices cannot be ruled out over longer horizons but require confirmation through sustained market strength. Speculation has also emerged around potential timelines, with some observers suggesting XRP could approach $8 by mid-year if broader market conditions, including Bitcoin’s performance, remain favorable. Analysts, however, caution that such outcomes depend on multiple variables and should not be viewed as guarantees. While opinions differ on how quickly XRP could advance, a growing number of analysts agree that the asset’s technical structure continues to support higher price levels. The persistence of the $8 target reflects confidence rooted in long-term chart analysis rather than short-term market reactions.

Crypto prices began to rally right after the news broke, as Cryptopolitan earlier reported that Bitcoin led the gains to over $94,000 after months of slow trading, as markets reacted to the political fallout tied to Venezuela and energy supply. “All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers earlier said. Crypto prices rally a bit as oil supply expectations change According to CNBC, Mackenzie Sagalos, crypto markets reporter, said traders are betting that Maduro’s capture could unlock oil supply held back for years. Venezuela sits on an estimated $17 trillion in untapped crude. If oil starts flowing again, supply rises, energy prices fall, and inflation pressure eases. Technically, Bitcoin reclaimed its 50-day moving average, a level traders track for short-term momentum. The price jump triggered short liquidations over the weekend, wiping out bearish bets. The setup differed from last summer’s Iran strikes, when fears of a Strait of Hormuz shutdown sent crypto prices lower. “This time though, the prospect of more supply on the horizon is being read as disinflationary and risk on. Venezuela has been an early adopter of crypto as a currency and use of it,” said Mackenzie. Venezuela has a long crypto history driven by its astonishing economic collapse, as inflation in the bolivar pushed people toward crypto as far back as 2017. Households mined Bitcoin and Ethereum at home to secure steady cash flow. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that the Venezuelan government with holding 240 Bitcoin, worth about $22 million, but then a Whale Hunt report denied that on Monday and estimated a possible shadow reserve of up to 600,000 Bitcoin, worth like $60 billion at current prices and nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is scheduled attend an energy conference hosted by Goldman Sachs in Miami this week. Executives from Chevron and ConocoPhillips are also expected to attend.

This significant single-day movement, recorded on March 21, 2025, represents one of the most substantial sentiment shifts in recent months, yet investors continue to approach digital assets with notable caution. The index serves as a crucial psychological barometer for the $2.1 trillion cryptocurrency market, providing quantifiable insight into the emotional state of market participants across global exchanges. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reaches 44: Understanding the Metrics The Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents extreme fear and 100 signifies extreme greed. The current reading of 44 places the market squarely in the “Fear” category, which typically ranges from 25 to 49 points. This measurement derives from a sophisticated multi-factor analysis developed by Alternative, a German-based financial data platform specializing in cryptocurrency metrics. The platform’s methodology has gained widespread acceptance among institutional and retail investors since its introduction in 2018, particularly during periods of market volatility. Market analysts note that movements within the fear territory often precede significant price action. For instance, the index spent 47 consecutive days in extreme fear territory during the 2022 market downturn, which eventually preceded the 2023 recovery. The current reading represents the highest level since February 15, 2025, when the index briefly touched 48 before retreating. Historical data reveals that sustained readings below 50 typically correlate with accumulation phases, while readings above 75 often signal potential market tops. Component Analysis: What Drives the Sentiment Score The index calculation employs six weighted components that together create a comprehensive picture of market psychology. Each component receives specific weighting based on its historical correlation with market sentiment: Volatility (25%): Measures price fluctuations relative to historical averages, with higher volatility typically increasing fear readings Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading activity across major exchanges, with unusual volume spikes influencing sentiment Social Media (15%): Tracks cryptocurrency mentions and sentiment across Twitter, Reddit, and specialized forums Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from periodic investor sentiment surveys conducted across multiple platforms Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms across global regions Recent data shows volatility contributed significantly to the fear reading, with 30-day volatility remaining 18% above the yearly average. Meanwhile, trading volume increased 22% week-over-week, suggesting renewed interest despite cautious sentiment. Social media analysis reveals a 15% increase in neutral-to-positive cryptocurrency discussions, though bearish sentiment still dominates major platforms. Historical Context and Market Implications The current sentiment reading exists within a broader historical context that provides valuable perspective for investors. During the 2021 bull market peak, the index reached extreme greed levels above 90 for multiple consecutive weeks. Conversely, the 2022 bear market bottom saw the index languish in single-digit extreme fear territory for extended periods. The 44 reading represents a moderate recovery from the 26 reading recorded just two weeks prior, suggesting gradual improvement in market psychology. Market structure analysis reveals several supporting factors for the sentiment shift. Bitcoin’s price stability above $68,000 throughout the week provided foundational support, while Ethereum’s successful network upgrades reduced technical concerns. Additionally, regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions has improved institutional confidence, though uncertainty persists in key markets. The following table illustrates recent index movements and corresponding market conditions: Date Index Reading Sentiment Category Bitcoin Price March 14, 2025 26 Fear $65,200 March 18, 2025 32 Fear $67,800 March 21, 2025 44 Fear $68,400 Technical analysts emphasize that sentiment indicators often serve as contrarian signals when reaching extremes. The current moderate fear reading suggests neither excessive pessimism nor unwarranted optimism, potentially indicating a healthy market environment for gradual accumulation. However, macroeconomic factors including interest rate expectations and geopolitical developments continue to influence broader risk asset sentiment, creating cross-market correlations that affect cryptocurrency valuations. Expert Perspectives on Sentiment Indicators Financial analysts emphasize the importance of contextualizing sentiment data within broader market frameworks. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Senior Market Analyst at Digital Asset Research Institute, notes: “The Fear & Greed Index provides valuable emotional temperature readings, but investors should consider multiple data points. The current movement from 26 to 44 represents meaningful improvement, yet we remain well below the neutral 50 threshold that typically signals balanced sentiment.” Her research indicates that sustained readings between 40-60 often correlate with the healthiest long-term market environments. Institutional adoption patterns further contextualize the sentiment reading. According to quarterly reports from major financial institutions, cryptocurrency allocation among professional investors increased 8% during the first quarter of 2025 despite sentiment readings in fear territory. This divergence suggests sophisticated investors may view fear periods as accumulation opportunities rather than exit signals. Meanwhile, retail investor participation, as measured by exchange registrations and small transaction volumes, remains 15% below December 2024 levels, indicating continued caution among individual market participants. Sector Performance and Correlation Analysis Different cryptocurrency sectors demonstrate varying sensitivity to sentiment indicators. Bitcoin and major layer-1 protocols typically show stronger correlation with the Fear & Greed Index, while decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens and meme coins exhibit more volatile responses. During the recent sentiment improvement, Bitcoin dominance increased slightly from 52.3% to 52.8%, suggesting capital preservation preferences among investors. Ethereum and other smart contract platforms showed moderate gains, though performance varied based on individual network developments and roadmap progress. Regional analysis reveals interesting sentiment disparities. Asian markets, particularly Japan and South Korea, showed earlier sentiment improvement beginning in late February. European markets demonstrated more gradual recovery, while North American sentiment improved most significantly during the recent reporting period. These geographical variations reflect differing regulatory environments, economic conditions, and cultural attitudes toward cryptocurrency adoption. Google Trends data confirms these patterns, with search volume increases varying by region and specific cryptocurrency terms. The relationship between sentiment and actual market behavior remains complex. Historical analysis shows that extreme fear readings often precede substantial rallies, as seen in January 2023 when the index rose from 8 to 55 within six weeks alongside a 45% Bitcoin price increase. However, moderate fear readings like the current 44 level have historically produced mixed short-term results, with market direction often determined by fundamental developments rather than sentiment alone. This complexity underscores the importance of using sentiment indicators as one component within a comprehensive analytical framework. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 44 represents meaningful improvement in market psychology while maintaining readings in fear territory. This positioning suggests cautious optimism among investors, with sentiment recovery supported by price stability, increased volume, and reduced volatility. The index components provide valuable insight into the emotional drivers affecting the $2.1 trillion cryptocurrency market, though investors should consider these readings alongside fundamental and technical analysis. As the market continues to mature, sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index will remain essential tools for understanding the psychological dimensions of cryptocurrency investing, particularly during transitional periods between market phases. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 44 mean? The reading of 44 indicates the market remains in “Fear” territory, though showing significant improvement from recent levels. This suggests investors are cautious but not panicked, with sentiment gradually recovering from more extreme fear readings. Q2: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, typically reflecting market conditions from the previous 24 hours. The platform uses real-time data feeds from multiple sources to ensure current readings. Q3: Can the Fear & Greed Index predict cryptocurrency prices? While not a direct price predictor, the index often serves as a contrarian indicator at extremes. Historically, sustained extreme fear has preceded rallies, while extreme greed has often preceded corrections. Q4: How reliable is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as an investment tool? The index provides valuable sentiment context but should not serve as a standalone investment tool. Most analysts recommend combining sentiment data with fundamental, technical, and on-chain analysis for comprehensive decision-making. Q5: Has the index methodology changed since its creation? The core methodology has remained consistent, though weightings receive periodic review based on market evolution. The current six-component structure has proven effective across multiple market cycles since 2018.

This measurable movement, recorded on March 15, 2025, represents the most significant single-day increase in the index since January and suggests changing investor behavior in the evolving digital asset landscape. Market analysts immediately noted the development’s importance, particularly given the index’s role as a quantitative gauge for measuring relative performance between Bitcoin and the top 100 cryptocurrencies excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Climb to 26 The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market thermometer, systematically comparing Bitcoin’s performance against the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This calculation specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clearer picture of speculative and utility-driven assets. According to CoinMarketCap’s methodology, a reading closer to 100 indicates a full altcoin season, which officially occurs when 75% of these top altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a consecutive 90-day period. Consequently, the recent climb from 22 to 26 represents meaningful movement toward that threshold, though substantial distance remains before reaching seasonal territory. Market data reveals that this four-point increase followed three weeks of relative stability between 20 and 22 on the index. Historical analysis shows that similar movements in early 2021 preceded significant altcoin rallies, though past performance never guarantees future results. The current reading of 26 places the market in what analysts describe as “neutral-to-bullish” territory for altcoins, with several technical indicators suggesting continued momentum. Importantly, the index measures relative performance rather than absolute price movements, meaning altcoins could theoretically decline in value but still outperform Bitcoin during the measurement period. Historical Context and Market Significance Examining the Altcoin Season Index’s historical data provides essential context for understanding the current 26 reading. During the notable altcoin season of 2021, the index reached sustained readings above 75 for multiple consecutive months, with peaks approaching 90 during the most intense periods of altcoin outperformance. By comparison, the 2022-2023 bear market saw the index frequently dip below 10, reflecting Bitcoin’s relative resilience during market downturns. The current 26 reading therefore represents a meaningful recovery from those lows while remaining well below euphoric levels. Several factors typically contribute to rising Altcoin Season Index readings. Increased institutional adoption of diverse blockchain projects often drives capital rotation from Bitcoin to specific altcoins with strong fundamentals. Additionally, technological developments in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and layer-2 scaling solutions frequently generate independent momentum for associated tokens. Market analysts also observe that reduced Bitcoin dominance often correlates with periods of broader cryptocurrency market health, as diversified investment suggests confidence in the ecosystem beyond its flagship asset. Expert Analysis of Current Market Dynamics Financial researchers at Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance note that rising Altcoin Season Index readings frequently coincide with increased on-chain activity across multiple blockchain networks. Their 2024 Q4 report documented correlation coefficients between the index and metrics like daily active addresses, transaction volumes, and decentralized application usage. This relationship suggests that fundamental network utility, rather than purely speculative trading, increasingly drives altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, data from CryptoCompare shows that trading volume ratios between Bitcoin and major altcoins have shifted gradually throughout early 2025. Ethereum’s daily trading volume reached 68% of Bitcoin’s in February, up from 62% in December 2024. Similarly, Solana and Cardano have seen their volume ratios increase by approximately 15% and 8% respectively during the same period. These volume shifts often precede changes in price performance ratios, potentially explaining the Altcoin Season Index’s recent movement. Technical Components and Calculation Methodology The Altcoin Season Index employs a transparent calculation methodology that market participants can independently verify. CoinMarketCap’s system tracks the percentage of top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over three distinct timeframes: the past 30 days, 90 days, and 365 days. The index then weights these percentages, with the 90-day performance carrying the most significance in the final calculation. This multi-timeframe approach helps smooth out short-term volatility while capturing sustained trends. For a cryptocurrency to qualify as “outperforming Bitcoin,” it must demonstrate a higher percentage price increase (or smaller percentage decrease) than Bitcoin over the measured period. This relative performance measurement proves particularly valuable because it accounts for overall market direction. During bear markets, altcoins that decline less than Bitcoin still register as outperforming, while during bull markets, they must appreciate more rapidly. The exclusion of stablecoins ensures the index reflects risk asset performance, while excluding wrapped tokens prevents double-counting of Bitcoin’s influence through tokenized versions on other chains. Impact on Investment Strategies and Portfolio Allocation Professional cryptocurrency fund managers frequently reference the Altcoin Season Index when making allocation decisions. According to a survey published by Digital Asset Management Firm Association in February 2025, 72% of institutional crypto funds incorporate the index into their rebalancing frameworks. Most commonly, funds increase altcoin exposure when the index sustains readings above 25 for multiple weeks, while reducing exposure when it falls below 15. This systematic approach helps institutions navigate market cycles while managing risk through quantitative indicators. Retail investors should understand that the Altcoin Season Index serves as one indicator among many, not a standalone trading signal. Financial advisors consistently recommend considering fundamental factors like project development, token utility, and adoption metrics alongside technical indicators. The index’s greatest utility lies in providing context about market phase rather than predicting individual asset performance. Historically, rising index readings have correlated with increased volatility across altcoin markets, necessitating appropriate risk management regardless of bullish signals. Comparative Analysis with Other Market Indicators The Altcoin Season Index gains additional significance when analyzed alongside complementary market metrics. Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization, currently stands at 52.3%, down from 54.1% a month ago. This 1.8 percentage point decline aligns with the Altcoin Season Index’s four-point increase, demonstrating consistency between different measurement approaches. Similarly, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has maintained “neutral” readings between 45 and 55 throughout March 2025, suggesting the Altcoin Season Index movement occurs within a context of measured market sentiment rather than euphoria or panic. Advanced analytics platforms like Glassnode and Santiment provide additional data layers that enrich interpretation of the Altcoin Season Index. Their on-chain metrics reveal whether rising index readings correspond with genuine network adoption or merely speculative trading. Current data shows moderate increases in both active addresses and transaction counts across major altcoin networks, suggesting at least partial fundamental support for the index movement. This combination of price and utility metrics provides a more complete picture than any single indicator alone. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s climb to 26 represents a measurable shift in cryptocurrency market dynamics, reflecting growing altcoin momentum relative to Bitcoin’s historical dominance. While this four-point increase falls short of indicating a full altcoin season, it provides valuable information about current market phase and investor behavior. Market participants should monitor whether this movement sustains over coming weeks, as consistent readings above 25 have historically preceded periods of altcoin outperformance. Ultimately, the index serves as one important tool among many for understanding complex cryptocurrency market relationships, with its current reading suggesting cautious optimism for diversified digital asset portfolios in 2025’s evolving landscape. FAQs Q1: What does the Altcoin Season Index measure exactly? The index measures the percentage of top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over 30, 90, and 365-day periods, with particular emphasis on the 90-day timeframe. Q2: At what level does an altcoin season officially begin? According to CoinMarketCap’s methodology, an altcoin season officially occurs when the index sustains a reading above 75, indicating that 75% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over 90 days. Q3: How significant is a four-point increase in the index? A four-point increase represents meaningful movement, particularly following weeks of stability. However, it remains well below the 75 threshold that defines an altcoin season, indicating gradual rather than dramatic shift. Q4: Does a rising Altcoin Season Index guarantee altcoin price increases? No, the index measures relative performance against Bitcoin, not absolute price direction. Altcoins could decline in value but still outperform if they decline less than Bitcoin during the same period. Q5: How should investors use the Altcoin Season Index? Investors should consider the index as one contextual tool among many, combining it with fundamental analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio strategy rather than relying on it as a standalone trading signal.

According to CryptoOnchain, the size of individual deposits has jumped — average transfers onto the exchange rose from around eight to 10 Bitcoin to highs near 22 to 26 Bitcoin. Related Reading: $18 Million Ethereum Loss Sends Whale Running To Gold At the same time, withdrawals have shrunk, with the Exchange Outflow Mean reported between 5.5 and 8.3 Bitcoin. That change in behavior signals a shift away from taking coins into long-term storage and toward holding tradable balances on-platform. Rising Deposit Sizes And Flat Stablecoin Flows Based on reports, the move onto Binance did not arrive with fresh buying power. Stablecoin net flows were essentially flat, showing an inflow of $42 million for the week, a figure that analysts say mostly reflected token transfers between Ethereum and Tron rather than new capital entering crypto. CryptoOnchain said that such large transfers to exchanges can mean preparation for selling or the use of assets as collateral in derivatives markets. In plain terms: more supply is ready to hit the market, while obvious signs of new demand are missing. Market Action Tested By Geopolitics Bitcoin traded around $92,620 after earlier hitting a 24-hour peak of $93,180, and it was reported to have climbed to a three-week high of $93,340 in early Asian trading. The price moves came as political tension rose following the US military’s action on Venezuela that resulted in the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro. Meanwhile, gold climbed above $4,400 an ounce, and silver jumped as much as 4.8%. According to FalconX, the recent Bitcoin uptick was driven in part by crypto-focused firms and by limited selling from miners and big holders. Selling Pressure Versus Thin Demand Analysts are watching the mismatch. Large deposits and a fall in the average size of withdrawals suggest that major holders are less willing to lock up Bitcoin in cold storage. Reports say accumulation has stalled since October. That combination creates a scenario where price rallies are more likely to be met by selling from holders who have quietly moved assets onto exchanges. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Outlook: Cautious, Not Catastrophic Based on these signals, the risk of downward pressure has risen but a major crash is not guaranteed. Price strength right now appears tied to headlines and cross-market moves as much as to fresh crypto demand. Traders and investors will be watching whether stablecoin inflows pick up or whether whales actually press sell. US President Donald Trump’s previously cited pro-crypto stance was not enough to reverse the accumulation lull by year-end, and until buyers return in force, gains may be limited and short lived.

56871168,653951,1767661254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56871168.jpeg,"Violent Attacks On Crypto Holders Escalate Worldwide, Data Shows",https://bitcoinist.com/violent-attacks-crypto-holders-escalate-worldwide/,bitcoinist,"Violent “wrench attacks” against crypto holders, physical robberies and kidnappings meant to force victims to hand over coins, appear to be rising in absolute terms and trending more severe, according to a new visualization built from a long-running incident database maintained by security researcher Jameson Lopp. Dragonfly partner Haseeb Qureshi said he analyzed Lopp’s dataset and built an interactive dashboard to stress-test a question many traders and builders have been asking quietly for years: is simply holding crypto becoming physically more dangerous? “You’re not imagining it: the number of attacks has been increasing over time,” Qureshi wrote on X. “Not only that, the attacks are getting more violent.” The dashboard breaks reported incidents into five severity bands — Minor, Moderate, Serious, Severe, and Fatal and the distribution skews heavily toward the sharp end of the spectrum. Of 269 categorized incidents shown, 137 (51%) were labeled “Serious,” 57 (21%) “Severe,” and 13 (5%) “Fatal,” with the remainder split between 39 (14%) “Moderate” and 23 (9%) “Minor.” The year-by-year bars show the later years carrying a larger share of “Severe” and “Fatal” outcomes than the early history of the dataset, with 2025 appearing as the highest-incident year on the chart. Qureshi’s analysis also puts a number on the most intuitive driver: price. Charting incidents against total crypto market capitalization, he reported a simple regression with an R² of 0.45 — implying roughly 45% of the variation in reported violence is explained by market cap alone. In plain terms, higher prices coincide with more attacks. But the more consequential question for everyday holders is not raw counts; it’s risk per person. Because comprehensive “number of crypto users” data is hard to pin down, Qureshi used Coinbase monthly active users as a proxy, and separately normalized incidents by market cap to approximate attacks per dollar of wealth. The resulting “normalized attack rates” chart tells a less linear story: per-user attack rates spiked in earlier market eras (notably around 2015 and again in 2018), then fell sharply after 2019, before ticking higher in the most recent observations. “So is that it?” Qureshi asked. “Proof crypto is becoming more physically dangerous?” On his telling, not quite. Coinbase MAUs, he noted, expanded dramatically over the decade, while normalized attack rates did not rise proportionally, suggesting a meaningful “population effect” behind the higher headline totals. Still, the per-user line has moved up from its post-2019 lows, roughly back toward the levels seen during the 2021 cycle, even as the “attacks per $ of market cap” line remains comparatively flat in recent years. Geography adds another uncomfortable layer. A regional table in the dashboard shows Western Europe (73 attacks) and North America (64) as the two largest buckets by incident count, with Asia-Pacific also substantial (53). But the most lethal outcomes cluster elsewhere: Latin America shows a 21% fatality rate and Africa 17%, versus 0% in North America. Qureshi underscored that point directly: “Notably, there have been 0 fatalities in North America ever,” he wrote, adding that the “lion’s share” of fatalities are in Latin America and Africa. Lopp, who has maintained the underlying “Bitcoin Wrench Attack” archive for years, has warned the workload and frequency are becoming harder to treat as isolated incidents. “When an event goes from being rare to happening every few days, it’s no longer newsworthy — it’s just a fact of life,” he wrote in a Dec. 21 post cited in the thread, while inviting others to help maintain the database.

Price has climbed steadily over the past two years, but the explosive move that points to the late stages of a Bitcoin bull phase has been absent. According to an analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Sykodelic, the confusion is due to a structural change that separates this cycle from every major Bitcoin rally that came before it. The difference is not psychological or technical in the usual sense of a four-year cycle. Liquidity Difference In This Cycle The disconnect between Bitcoin’s current price action and previous four-year cycles has led to questions among crypto analysts over whether the cycle has already peaked or if something different is influencing its behavior beneath the surface. For instance, during the 2020-2021 bull market, Bitcoin’s peak coincided with a period of extreme liquidity expansion. Bitcoin followed that inflowinto a classic parabolic blow-off once liquidity conditions reached their most expansive point. The chart shared by Sykodelic shows this trend clearly. The liquidity index peaked near the price top in 2021 after a stretch of growth from the quantitative expansion in late 2019. This was followed by a fall that aligned with the 2022 bear market, which eventually ended with the bear market bottom. Related Reading: XRP Price Will Not Hit $1,000 In 2026, Analyst Reveals Best Timeline Interestingly, that pattern of Bitcoin’s price action following the liquidity index has repeated in every previous bullish cycle. This time, the structure is inverted. The liquidity index did not peak around Bitcoin’s most recent all-time high above $126,000. Instead, the liquidity has been ranging and only recently began stabilizing back around levels seen during the 2022 bear market bottom. One of the most unusual aspects of this cycle is how far Bitcoin has already traveled despite limited liquidity support. Sykodelic points out that Bitcoin advanced from the $15,000 region to well above $100,000 while global liquidity was range-bound, a trend that has never happened before. Bitcoin/US Dollar. Source: @Sykodelic_ on X Why The Parabola Has Been Delayed, Not Cancelled The absence of a parabolic surge has led many to assume the cycle is nearing exhaustion. However, Sykodelic argues the opposite. According to his interpretation of the global liquidity index, Bitcoin is not transitioning into a late-stage distribution phase but is currently bouncing from a liquidity trough. Previous crypto cycles relied heavily on unpredictable flows of money, but this cycle has leaned on new structural demand sources. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have introduced persistent institutional inflows, while government-level adoption has changed Bitcoin’s role in crypto investment portfolios. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying Furthermore, the AI-stock boom has led to traditional equity markets absorbing much of the available liquidity, leaving less capital to rotate aggressively into altcoins and broader crypto markets. The chart shows liquidity beginning to turn upward just as quantitative tightening winds down and liquidity conditions start to increase. The projection is that once the liquidity starts to rise and quantitative easing expands, then Bitcoin might start the missing parabolic behavior that will take it to new price highs.

56872958,654038,1767664816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56872958.jpeg,"Is Venezuela Controlling A $60 Billion Bitcoin Reserve, Or Is It Just A Rumor?",https://bitcoinist.com/is-venezuela-controlling-a-60-billion-bitcoin-reserve-or-is-it-just-a-rumor/,bitcoinist,"Venezuela may have quietly built a Bitcoin stash of roughly 600,000 to 660,000 BTC. That number would be worth about $56 billion to $67 billion at recent prices, intelligence reports cited by Whale Hunting analysts Bradley Hope and Clara Preve disclose. The said accumulation began around 2018 and involved swaps from gold sales and oil deals priced in stablecoins, then converted to Bitcoin. Some stories tie the chatter to recent political developments in Venezuela, saying the claims have stirred fresh attention on the nation’s finances and on Bitcoin markets. Public Records Tell A Different Story Based on reports from public blockchain trackers and treasury listings, the picture is far less dramatic. Official on-chain wallets linked to Venezuela’s government show about 240 BTC — roughly $22 million at current rates. How The Numbers Were Said To Work Reports that pushed the big number mentioned several methods of accumulation. Gold sales from state mining areas were named. Oil shipments priced in USDT or other crypto were mentioned too. Some accounts also suggest seized mining equipment and opaque trading channels were used to move value into Bitcoin over years. If any of that is true, then large sums could be off the books and hard to trace. Market Reaction And Political Buzz Bitcoin’s price has been sensitive to the story. Traders watched moves above $92,000 closely as the rumor spread. Some headlines linked the claims to geopolitical tensions and to questions about whether foreign authorities could seize or freeze any such reserve if it existed. Reports note that such a seizure would carry legal and diplomatic complications. US President Donald Trump’s recent comments on regional security further stoked interest in how geopolitical events and crypto markets can intersect. Why Skepticism Is Still Needed Investigative limits matter. Blockchain data is public, but wallets can be obfuscated through mixers, custodial services, or private keys held across many accounts. That makes absolute proof difficult without cooperation from those who control the coins or from an audited disclosure. Until verifiable custody records, independent audits, or clear on-chain links are produced, the numbers above should be read as unconfirmed claims rather than settled fact. Huge If True, Unproven Now Based on reports and on public trackers, Venezuela’s official, proven Bitcoin holdings remain small compared with the headline figures. The 600,000–660,000 BTC claim is dramatic; it would reshape market math if proven. For now, it is a high-impact rumor that needs concrete proof. Maduro’s Capture US forces recently carried out an operation targeting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, heightening geopolitical tensions in the region. Reports suggest the move has renewed interest in Venezuela’s alleged Bitcoin holdings and oil, with analysts watching closely for any impact on global crypto markets. The full consequences of the raid and Maduro’s capture are still unfolding.

Japan Enters Its ‘Digital Year’ On Monday, Japan’s Minister of Finance Satsuki Katayama endorsed the country’s efforts to integrate crypto assets and blockchain technology into the local financial markets, outlining her policy stance to support Japan’s development as an asset management nation, asserting that “there is still room for growth in shifting from savings to investment.” In her New Year’s address at the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s (TSE) Grand Opening Ceremony, celebrated on January 5, Katayama declared that 2026 would be the “Digital Year” for the nation. The Finance Minister pointed out that 2026 “is a turning point” for overcoming deflation, emphasizing the “importance of responsible, proactive fiscal policy and concentrated investment in growth sectors.” Notably, Katayama has previously shared a positive approach to crypto and the Web3 sectors, the reports added . Last year, she declared that “with robust governance, the crypto asset and Web3 sectors can develop significantly, and the future is very bright.” Local news media outlets reported that the Finance Minister expressed her support for integrating crypto assets into stock exchanges on Monday, highlighting the importance of existing financial infrastructure to increase exposure to crypto-related services. “For citizens to benefit from digital assets and blockchain-based assets, the role of commodity and securities exchanges is crucial,” she stated. During the New Year’s address, she also discussed the future of crypto-related investment products in Japan, underscoring how “In the U.S., ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are expanding as a means for citizens to hedge against inflation.” Despite the success of US spot ETFs, Japanese regulators have been cautious about digital asset-based funds. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has repeatedly expressed reservations about the investment products. Nonetheless, Katayama suggested that similar initiatives to those of the US would be pursued in Japan, signaling a potential launch of crypto-based investment products this year. She concluded her statement by declaring her support for the efforts carried out by exchanges in Japan to develop trading environments “utilizing such cutting-edge fintech and technology.” 2026 Framework To Reshape Local Crypto Landscape Over the past few years, Japanese authorities have been working to review their regulatory system and develop policies for customer fund safety and innovation in a more reliable industry. In December, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party published their upcoming FY2026 Tax Reform. As reported by Bitcoinist, the 2026 tax reform will introduce significant changes to the existing taxation system. These changes, long requested by Japanese investors, are set to address the categorization and regulation of crypto assets, reclassifying them as financial products. The proposal signals a shift from the assets’ previous treatment as speculative assets by Japanese financial authorities. Based on this, the reform is also studying the introduction of a separate taxation system for crypto income. The current progressive tax system, where digital asset gains can be taxed at up to 55%, would be replaced with a system like the one used for stocks, with a flat 20% tax on crypto income.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto asset|crypto regulation|Japan|Japan Crypto ETFs|Japan crypto legislation|Japan crypto tax reform|Japan Minister of Finance|japan Stock exchanges|Stock Exchanges,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Traders watched as BTC moved toward $93,000 after brief gains in global markets, hitting roughly $92,800 in early US trading. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s 16% Pop Signals Meme Coin Revival – Details Geopolitical Jitters And Market Moves According to market reports, comments from US President Donald Trump about potential action in Colombia added to market uncertainty, helping send flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Traders sold some positions and then bought back into BTC as prices steadied near the highs. ETF inflows were also cited as supporting demand, with one report noting about $645 million in net flows into Bitcoin spot ETFs around the same session. Bitcoin’s climb was modest in percentage terms, but the dollar amounts grabbed attention. Data showed BTC trading in the low $92,000s before attempts to push higher toward $93,000. Reports have also pointed to liquidations and futures activity that rearranged short positions, prompting quick moves in both directions.

Speaking on Sunday, Trump took aim at Colombia over cocaine trafficking, saying a fresh US military operation tied to the country “sounds good to me,” according to Reuters. He also warned that action may be needed in Mexico. Trump described Colombia as “very sick” and accused its leader of fueling the cocaine trade into the United States, saying that situation “won’t last very long.” Total crypto market valuation at $3.12 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView Institutional Flows And Market Structure Meanwhile, spot ETF purchases and macro traders were active during the move higher. The inflows cited in market pieces suggest institutions continued to add exposure, even as headline risk rose. At the same time, derivatives desks reported notable liquidations that briefly amplified volatility. Some analysts told outlets they see technical hurdles near the current range that could cap gains without fresh catalysts. Others said the next key levels to watch are the area around $93,000 and the lows near the $88,000s to $90,000s, where stop orders and margin calls could trigger sharper swings.

Traders are watching US economic data this week as well, since work on jobs and inflation prints could alter the tone for both stocks and crypto. Bitcoin’s push above $92,000 came at a moment of heightened news flow — where comments from US President Donald Trump and big institutional buying intersected. Prices moved quickly, numbers mattered, and traders now watch whether demand can hold near current levels or if headline risk will force a pullback.

MSCI’s index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose again, Japan’s Topix hit a record, and Hong Kong and mainland Chinese stocks added to gains as investors leaned into the same risk bid that carried US benchmarks higher overnight. Wall Street set the tone overnight, closing higher as financial stocks powered the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-time high and energy firms rallied after a US military strike captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Investors bet Washington’s move could unlock access for US companies to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, and Trump’s administration plans to meet oil executives this week to discuss boosting production. The gains capped a third straight year of double-digit advances for major US indexes, a streak last seen in 2021. *DOW HITS RECORD, ENERGY STOCKS END HIGHER AFTER US STRIKES VENEZUELA pic.twitter.com/xuZp7I31JU — Investing.com (@Investingcom) January 5, 2026 Markets Juggle Calm FX With Busy Commodities And Crypto Currencies told a calmer story. The US dollar held steady ahead of Friday’s jobs report after a sharp intraday swing a session earlier, when weaker factory data pulled the rug from under a short-lived dollar pop. Commodities stayed busy even without a new shock. Copper set a record amid disruptions in Chile, and gold hovered near all-time highs at about $4,449 an ounce, keeping the hedge trade in the conversation as geopolitics stays unpredictable. Crypto traders largely treated the Venezuela headlines as another catalyst for positioning rather than a thesis on its own. Some analysts also linked the Venezuela story to mining economics through energy. “Cheaper and more abundant energy would improve miner margins globally and could unlock a new phase of mining expansion, particularly in regions able to secure long-term power contracts,” Bitfinex analysts said.

This dramatic cascade of forced position closures, predominantly affecting traders betting against price increases, highlights the intense volatility and inherent risks within the crypto derivatives landscape. Consequently, this event serves as a critical case study for understanding market mechanics and risk management protocols. Crypto Perpetuals Liquidations: A Breakdown of the Data The liquidation data reveals a clear and overwhelming trend. Specifically, short sellers faced the most severe losses during this market move. Bitcoin (BTC), the market leader, accounted for the lion’s share of the carnage. Traders saw $186 million in BTC perpetual futures positions forcibly closed. Notably, a staggering 91.26% of this volume, approximately $169.7 million, stemmed from short positions that were caught on the wrong side of a price surge. Ethereum (ETH) followed a similar pattern, albeit on a slightly smaller scale. The network recorded $78.27 million in ETH perpetual liquidations. Within this total, short positions constituted 74.91%, equating to roughly $58.6 million. Meanwhile, XRP perpetuals faced $30.44 million in liquidations, with short positions making up 82.02% or about $24.97 million of the total. This data underscores a market-wide phenomenon rather than an asset-specific incident. Understanding the Mechanics of a Short Squeeze This event perfectly exemplifies a classic short squeeze in digital asset markets. A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset begins to rise rapidly. Traders who have borrowed and sold an asset, betting its price will fall (short sellers), then face mounting losses. As prices climb, these traders must either add more collateral to maintain their positions or face automatic liquidation by the exchange. This forced buying to close losing short positions creates additional upward pressure on the price, potentially triggering further liquidations in a cascading effect. Several factors can precipitate such a squeeze in crypto markets: Leverage: Perpetual contracts often allow for high leverage, sometimes exceeding 100x. While this amplifies potential gains, it also drastically increases risk. Funding Rates: These periodic payments between long and short positions help tether the perpetual contract price to the spot price. A persistently positive funding rate can make holding short positions expensive. Market Sentiment Shift: A sudden influx of positive news or large buy orders can quickly reverse market direction. Historical Context and Market Resilience While notable, a $294.7 million liquidation event is not historically unprecedented. For instance, the crypto market has experienced single-day liquidation volumes exceeding $1 billion during periods of extreme volatility, such as the Luna/Terra collapse in May 2022 or the FTX contagion in November 2022. However, this recent event is significant because it occurred without a major, negative macroeconomic catalyst or exchange failure. Instead, it appears to be a product of organic market dynamics and leveraged positioning. Analysts often compare such data to gauge market leverage and risk. The concentrated nature of the liquidations—primarily on short positions—suggests the market was overly pessimistic or crowded in its short bets before the price move. This liquidation flush can create a healthier, less leveraged market foundation, potentially reducing volatility in the immediate aftermath. The Broader Impact on Traders and Exchanges The immediate impact of such a liquidation cascade is twofold. First, individual traders and funds with leveraged positions face direct capital losses. These losses can be total if a trader’s entire collateral is exhausted. Second, the process tests the robustness of derivative exchanges’ risk engines. Efficient liquidation systems are crucial for preventing losses from spilling over to affect other traders or the exchange’s solvency. The smooth processing of nearly $300 million in liquidations without reported system failures indicates maturation in exchange infrastructure. Furthermore, events like this influence future trader behavior. They serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with high leverage, especially in a market known for its 24/7 operation and rapid price swings. Consequently, risk management practices, such as using stop-loss orders and maintaining lower leverage ratios, receive renewed emphasis among the trading community. Conclusion The $294.7 million crypto perpetuals liquidations event provides a clear window into the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency derivatives trading. The disproportionate impact on short sellers underscores how quickly market sentiment can shift, triggering cascading liquidations through leveraged positions. This event reinforces the critical importance of prudent risk management for participants in the perpetual futures market. Ultimately, while such volatility presents opportunity, it also demands respect for the powerful market forces at play. FAQs Q1: What are crypto perpetual futures contracts? A1: Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date. They use a funding rate mechanism to track the underlying spot price. Q2: Why were short positions mainly liquidated in this event? A2: The data indicates the market price of major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH rose during this period. This price increase caused losses for traders who had bet on price declines (short sellers), triggering margin calls and forced liquidations of their positions. Q3: How does leverage contribute to large liquidation events? A3: High leverage magnifies both gains and losses. A small price move against a highly leveraged position can quickly erase the trader’s collateral, forcing the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent negative balance. Q4: Is a $294.7 million liquidation event considered large? A4: While significant, it is a moderate-sized event historically. The crypto derivatives market has seen single-day liquidation volumes several times larger during major market crises, though this event is notable for its focused impact on short sellers. Q5: What can traders do to manage liquidation risk? A5: Traders can employ several risk management strategies: using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders to automatically exit positions at a predetermined price, constantly monitoring margin ratios, and avoiding over-concentration in a single trade direction.

Here’s what crypto holders need to know: #1 BTC: Bank Of America Opens The Advisory Spigot Starting January 5, advisers across Bank of America Private Bank, Merrill, and Merrill Edge can recommend “several crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs)” for client portfolios, removing prior asset thresholds and shifting advisers from execution-only to active allocation guidance. In an early-December note tied to the rollout, Merrill’s Chris Hyzy framed the bank’s stance in portfolio-construction terms: “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate.” Related Reading: 2026 Crypto Market Prediction: Will Prices Soar Or Face Continued Declines? The market relevance is less about one day of flows and more about plumbing. Bank of America is one of the largest US wealth distribution networks; even a modest allocation over the long-term could have significant price impact. #2 Ethereum Blob Capacity Steps Up Again Ethereum’s latest scaling cadence continues on January 7 via the second “Blob Parameter Only” upgrade (BPO2), which increases the per-block blob target and maximum to 14 and 21, respectively, an incremental move designed to expand rollup data throughput without bundling the change into a larger named hard fork. The Ethereum Foundation has positioned the BPO track as a deliberately minimal, config-only mechanism to “safely increase blob throughput” after Fusaka. For L2 users, the direct linkage is data availability pricing. More blob supply, all else equal, can pressure blob fees lower, which is the component many rollups pass through into end-user transaction costs. The nuance is that these gains are conditional: if demand for blobspace ramps as quickly as capacity, fee relief can be muted, and operators still have to validate stability as targets rise. #3 Hyperliquid (HYPE) Token Unlock Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has a scheduled supply event on January 6: Hyperliquid Labs team members are set to receive an initial 1.2 million HYPE allocation, valued at roughly $31.2 million. Core contributors hold rights to approximately 237 million tokens under a structured release plan, nearly one quarter of the total supply. The setup for traders is straightforward: token unlocks are reflexively modeled as potential sell pressure, but the realized impact depends on recipient behavior and any offsetting mechanics. #4 Stellar’s Privacy Track Moves To Testnet Stellar is scheduled to upgrade its testnet to Protocol 25, branded “Stellar X-Ray”, on January 7 at 21:00 UTC, with the mainnet vote slated for January 22. In its developer guidance, Stellar explicitly calls out the operational requirement: SDK and infrastructure operators should upgrade ahead of the testnet date, with holiday timing cited as a reason for the unusually long runway between stable releases and activation. Related Reading: Austin Arnold Unveils His Top 6 Crypto Altcoin Picks For 2026 On the product side, Stellar frames X-Ray as foundational privacy infrastructure: “laying the groundwork for developers to build configurable, compliance-forward privacy applications using zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography,” while keeping the network’s transparency model intact. #5 Macro Outlook Macro is doing crypto no favors in terms of clean narratives. Over the weekend, US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a move that pushed Bitcoin and crypto prices higher. Oil initially jolted but then softened amid expectations that near-term supply disruption is limited. Geopolitically, the spillover risk is in escalation rather than the single event. US President Trump raised the possibility of further interventions in the region, including language around Colombia. Overall, the weekly US market open will be crucial for the week. Rates politics are the other macro overhang. Trump has repeatedly said he will name his pick to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell “early next year,” with Powell’s leadership term ending in May 2026; the process has turned into a live market variable because of what it implies about the White House’s preferred rate path and perceived Fed independence. With prediction markets explicitly trading on whether a nomination lands by January 9, some crypto desks will treat the date as a volatility waypoint even if mainstream reporting stays looser on timing. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.12. trillion.

56876713,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258714,1767672611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $694.7M Floods Into U.S. Spot Funds, Signaling Robust Confidence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-inflows-january-2025/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $694.7M Floods Into U.S. Spot Funds, Signaling Robust Confidence On January 5, 2025, the U.S. financial markets witnessed a powerful demonstration of institutional conviction as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted a staggering net inflow of $694.67 million. This substantial capital movement, confirmed by data from analyst Trader T, marks the second consecutive day of positive flows. Consequently, it reinforces a bullish trend for regulated cryptocurrency investment vehicles. The data reveals a clear preference for established asset managers, with industry titans BlackRock and Fidelity commanding the lion’s share of new investor capital. This event provides a critical snapshot of institutional sentiment and the evolving landscape of digital asset adoption within traditional finance frameworks. Breaking Down the $694.7 Million Bitcoin ETF Inflow The January 5th data presents a detailed breakdown of capital allocation across the major spot Bitcoin ETF providers. The inflows were not evenly distributed, highlighting clear market leaders. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the charge with an impressive single-day inflow of $371.89 million. Following closely, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $191.19 million in new assets. These two giants collectively accounted for over 81% of the total daily net inflow, underscoring their dominant market position and investor trust. Other funds also reported meaningful contributions, demonstrating broad-based interest. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) attracted $38.45 million, while Ark Invest’s ARKB saw $36.03 million. Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC gathered $15.02 million and $13.64 million, respectively. Smaller inflows were recorded for Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) at $7.19 million and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) at $5.34 million. Notably, Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust also saw a positive movement of $17.92 million. This collective action paints a picture of widespread, though tiered, institutional engagement. The Context and Significance of Sustained Inflows This two-day inflow streak did not occur in a vacuum. It follows a period of intense scrutiny and volatility common in nascent financial markets. The approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 represented a watershed regulatory moment. Since then, these products have provided a crucial bridge between traditional capital markets and the digital asset ecosystem. Sustained net inflows, especially of this magnitude, are a vital health metric. They indicate that the initial novelty has matured into sustained, demand-driven investment. Market analysts often view consecutive days of net positive flows as a signal of building momentum. It suggests that buying pressure from new investors is outweighing any profit-taking or rotational selling. For the cryptocurrency market, this institutional validation is paramount. It moves the narrative beyond speculative retail trading and into the realm of strategic portfolio allocation. The data from January 5th, therefore, is more than a single day’s tally; it is a data point in a larger trend of financial legitimization. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Traction Financial experts point to several factors driving this activity. First, the year’s beginning often sees portfolio rebalancing and new capital deployments. Large asset managers and registered investment advisors may be executing planned allocations. Second, the fee structures of these ETFs have become a competitive battlefield. Providers like Franklin Templeton and Bitwise offer some of the lowest management fees, which attracts cost-conscious institutional capital. However, the January 5th data shows that brand recognition and scale, exemplified by BlackRock and Fidelity, remain powerful draws despite slightly higher fees. Furthermore, the performance of the underlying asset, Bitcoin, plays a role. Price stability or upward momentum in Bitcoin can trigger increased ETF buying as a correlated, easier-access proxy. The inflows also reflect a maturation of the product ecosystem. Investors now have clear choices between high-liquidity giants and niche, low-cost options. This competition fosters a healthier market, ultimately benefiting investors through better services and tighter spreads. The diversity of firms seeing inflows—from traditional finance behemoths to crypto-native asset managers—shows a well-rounded and competitive market structure. Comparative Performance and Long-Term Implications To understand the scale of the January 5th event, a brief comparison is useful. Early trading days post-launch in 2024 saw record-breaking volumes, but flows have since normalized into patterns reflecting longer-term sentiment. A single-day net inflow approaching $700 million ranks among the strongest performances since the initial launch frenzy subsided. It suggests that the product category is not only maintaining interest but potentially accelerating it as familiarity grows. The long-term implications are multifaceted. For the traditional finance industry, robust inflows validate the strategic decision to enter the digital asset space. It creates a virtuous cycle where success attracts more product development and investor education. For the broader cryptocurrency market, consistent ETF buying creates a structural demand source. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, ETF shares represent a locked-up demand that typically moves through custodians and authorized participants, adding a layer of stability to market dynamics. Conclusion The $694.7 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 5, 2025, stands as a significant marker of institutional adoption. Led decisively by BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, the movement of capital demonstrates growing comfort and strategic allocation toward Bitcoin within regulated frameworks. This event, part of a multi-day positive trend, reinforces the Bitcoin ETF’s role as a primary gateway for traditional finance into digital assets. The data offers a clear, quantitative measure of confidence, suggesting that these investment vehicles are transitioning from novel products to mainstream portfolio components. As the market evolves, tracking these flow patterns will remain essential for understanding the deepening integration between cryptocurrency and global finance. FAQs Q1: What is a net inflow in the context of a Bitcoin ETF? A net inflow occurs when the total value of new money invested into an ETF exceeds the value of money withdrawn on the same trading day. It indicates net buying pressure and increasing assets under management for the fund. Q2: Why are BlackRock and Fidelity receiving the largest inflows? BlackRock and Fidelity possess immense brand recognition, extensive distribution networks among financial advisors, and long-standing reputations in traditional finance. This trust factor often leads institutional and retail investors to favor their products when entering a new asset class like cryptocurrency. Q3: How do spot Bitcoin ETF inflows affect the price of Bitcoin? Inflows require the ETF issuer or its authorized participants to purchase the underlying asset—Bitcoin—to back the new shares created. This creates direct buying pressure on the Bitcoin market, which can be a supportive factor for its price, all else being equal. Q4: What is the difference between a spot Bitcoin ETF and other crypto ETFs? A spot Bitcoin ETF holds the actual cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) in custody. Other crypto ETFs might hold futures contracts, stocks of crypto-related companies, or a mix of assets. Spot ETFs provide direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. Q5: Are Bitcoin ETF flows a reliable indicator of market sentiment? Yes, they are considered a key, transparent indicator of institutional and broader market sentiment. Sustained net inflows generally signal positive, long-term-oriented demand, while sustained outflows can indicate pessimism or profit-taking. Daily data, however, should be viewed as part of a longer-term trend.

56877203,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258719,1767673511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Bull Signal: VanEck’s Crucial Index Reveals First Undervalued Market Reading Since April 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bull-signal-vaneck-index-april-2025/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Bull Signal: VanEck’s Crucial Index Reveals First Undervalued Market Reading Since April 2025 NEW YORK, October 2025 – The cryptocurrency market has registered a significant technical shift, with VanEck’s proprietary MarketVector Crypto Heat Index flashing its first Bitcoin bull signal in over six months. This pivotal development, occurring in a market long characterized by consolidation, suggests a potential transition from an extended period of neutrality. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing whether this indicator marks the beginning of a sustained recovery phase for digital assets. Decoding the Bitcoin Bull Signal from VanEck’s Index VanEck’s MarketVector Crypto Heat Index serves as a critical barometer for institutional and retail investors. The index specifically measures whether the digital asset market is overheated or undervalued. On October 15, 2025, the index recorded a reading of 16.8%. This figure fell decisively below the crucial 20% threshold. Therefore, it entered what analysts define as the ‘undervalued’ zone. This is the first time the index has dipped into this territory since April 2025. The methodology behind the index aggregates multiple on-chain and market metrics. These include network activity, trading volume trends, and social sentiment data. The resulting composite score provides a normalized view of market temperature. Historically, readings below 20% have often preceded periods of price appreciation for Bitcoin. For context, the index spent the majority of the third quarter of 2025 oscillating in a neutral range between 25% and 40%. This new low reading breaks that pattern decisively. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, publicly confirmed the analysis. He stated that the firm’s proprietary quantitative models have aligned to signal this bullish shift. “Our models are designed to filter out short-term noise,” Sigel noted in the cited analysis. “The convergence of signals we are observing now carries more statistical weight.” The Mechanics of Market Valuation Understanding the index’s movement requires examining its core components. The ‘heat’ metaphor directly relates to investor enthusiasm and capital flows. A high reading suggests excessive, potentially speculative interest. Conversely, a low reading indicates cooling sentiment and a lack of speculative froth. This often creates a foundation for more sustainable growth. The current 16.8% reading implies the market possesses underlying strength not reflected in recent price action. Furthermore, it suggests that selling pressure may be exhausting itself. Expert Analysis and Broader Market Stabilization Martin Leinweber, Head of MarketVector Index, provided crucial context for the index’s movement. He emphasized that the market appears to be stabilizing after a prolonged phase of sideways trading. “We are observing a broadening of performance,” Leinweber explained. “An increasing number of crypto assets are beginning to outperform Bitcoin on a relative basis.” This diversification of strength is a key characteristic of healthy market cycles. It indicates that capital is not merely rotating within a single asset but seeking value across the ecosystem. This dynamic makes further aggressive, broad-market sell-offs increasingly unlikely, according to the analysis. When multiple assets show independent strength, it reduces systemic risk. The performance divergence also suggests investors are conducting more fundamental analysis. They are moving beyond macro narratives tied solely to Bitcoin. For instance, sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and tokenized real-world assets have shown resilience. The table below summarizes key market phases relative to the Heat Index: Index Zone Reading Range Market Interpretation Typical Investor Action Overheated 80% – 100% High speculation, peak FOMO Profit-taking, caution advised Warm / Neutral 40% – 80% Moderate sentiment, trend continuation Selective accumulation or holding Cool / Neutral 20% – 40% Low enthusiasm, consolidation Research and watchlist building Undervalued (Current) 0% – 20% Potential accumulation zone Strategic dollar-cost averaging Leinweber’s comments align with on-chain data from other analytics firms. Metrics such as Bitcoin’s MVRV-Z Score and SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) have also hovered near historically low levels. These indicators often correlate with long-term investment opportunities. The convergence of these independent data points strengthens the case for a shifting market structure. Historical Context and the April 2025 Comparison The last time the VanEck index signaled similar conditions was in April 2025. That period followed a Q1 rally that lost momentum. The market then entered a corrective phase that lasted through the summer. The April signal was initially met with optimism, but broader macroeconomic headwinds, including shifting interest rate expectations, delayed a sustained bullish trend. The current environment in October 2025 presents several contrasting factors: Regulatory Clarity: Several major jurisdictions have finalized crypto asset frameworks since April, reducing regulatory uncertainty. Institutional Adoption: The pipeline for spot Bitcoin ETF inflows has shown consistent, albeit modest, positive trends. Macro Conditions: Inflation data has become more predictable, allowing traders to better assess the impact of monetary policy. Network Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s hash rate continues to reach all-time highs, signaling robust underlying network security and investment. This improved foundational context may allow the current bullish signal to manifest more strongly than its predecessor. However, analysts universally caution that a single indicator does not guarantee immediate price appreciation. It does, however, significantly alter the risk-reward profile for strategic allocators. The Role of Proprietary Models in Confirmation Matthew Sigel’s reference to VanEck’s proprietary models is significant. Large asset managers develop these internal tools to validate public-facing indices. They often incorporate alternative data sets, such as derivatives market positioning, liquidity depth on exchanges, and even geopolitical risk scores. The fact that these private models have also confirmed the signal adds a layer of institutional credibility. It suggests the finding is not an artifact of a single methodology but a consensus across different analytical approaches. Conclusion The VanEck MarketVector Crypto Heat Index’s move into undervalued territory marks a notable development for cryptocurrency investors. This Bitcoin bull signal , the first since April 2025, indicates a market that has shed excessive speculation and may be building a base for future growth. Expert analysis from Martin Leinweber and Matthew Sigel highlights concurrent stabilization and asset diversification as supportive factors. While indices and models are not infallible predictors, they provide essential data-driven waypoints. This shift suggests a potentially more favorable environment for strategic, long-term positions in Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Investors should monitor for confirmation through price action and volume in the coming weeks. FAQs Q1: What is the VanEck MarketVector Crypto Heat Index? The VanEck MarketVector Crypto Heat Index is a proprietary metric that analyzes multiple on-chain and market signals to determine if the cryptocurrency market is overheated or undervalued. It provides a single score, where readings below 20% are considered undervalued. Q2: Why is a reading below 20% considered a Bitcoin bull signal? A reading below the 20% threshold suggests the market has cooled from speculative excess. Historically, such periods of low sentiment and undervaluation have often preceded phases of price recovery and accumulation, making it a potential bullish indicator. Q3: How does this signal differ from the one in April 2025? While the index reading is similar, the broader market context has changed. Increased regulatory clarity, sustained institutional interest, and more stable macroeconomic conditions in October 2025 may provide a stronger foundation for the signal to translate into a sustained trend. Q4: Does this mean Bitcoin’s price will immediately rise? Not necessarily. A bullish signal from an index indicates a shift in underlying conditions and improves the risk-reward profile. It is a potential starting point, but price action depends on many factors, including broader market sentiment and macroeconomic developments. Q5: What should investors do in response to this signal? Investors should view this as one data point for their research. It may warrant reviewing investment strategies, such as considering dollar-cost averaging into positions. However, any decision should align with an individual’s risk tolerance and overall financial plan, not a single indicator.

The filing also listed a $5.01B deferred tax benefit tied to that quarterly loss, giving investors a window into how the accounting swings with crypto prices even when the company keeps holding. For the full year ended Dec. 31, 2025, Strategy said it recorded a $5.40B unrealized loss on digital assets and a $1.55B associated deferred tax benefit. Strategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin Despite Q4 Unrealized Loss Strategy said its digital asset carrying value stood at $58.85B as of Dec. 31, 2025, alongside a $2.42B related deferred tax liability, showing the scale of the balance sheet it has built around crypto. Even with the Q4 hit, the company kept buying. Strategy said it acquired 1,283 BTC between Jan. 1 and Jan. 4 for $116M at an average purchase price of $90,391, bringing aggregate Bitcoin holdings to 673,783 as of Jan. 4. @Strategy has expanded its Bitcoin treasury again — adding 1,287 BTC in early January and lifting total holdings to 673,783 BTC. #Strategy #Bitcoin https://t.co/mB82IzfVHl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 5, 2026 The company funded those purchases through stock sales under its at-the-market program. Strategy said the Bitcoin buys were made using proceeds from sales of its Class A common stock, and it reported net proceeds of $116.3M from selling 735,000 shares between Jan. 1 and Jan. 4. Capital Raises And Liquidity Buffers Frame Strategy’s Crypto Bet It also reported net proceeds of $195.9M from selling 1,255,911 shares between Dec. 29 and Dec. 31, continuing a familiar playbook of raising equity and converting it into Bitcoin. Strategy’s aggregate purchase price for its Bitcoin position was $50.55B as of Jan. 4, with an average purchase price of $75,026, according to the filing. The company also said it maintained a $2.25B US dollar reserve as of Jan. 4 to support dividend payments on preferred stock and interest on outstanding debt, a liquidity buffer that matters when crypto markets turn. Strategy cautioned that the financial information in the 8-K was prepared by management, and said its independent auditor, KPMG, had not audited or reviewed the figures and did not express an opinion on them.

Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Bitcoin As A Store Of Value Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, with a hard cap of 21 million coins. That matters because, as Jeremie and other long-term holders point out, Bitcoin is best used to hold value you earned elsewhere. Stacking, in practice, means buying small amounts regularly. Time means keeping those holdings for years. Both together reduce the pressure to guess tops and bottoms and make the plan mechanical rather than emotional. Many buyers still chase quick gains. They ask when the next big run will hit. The answer from long-term traders is simple: hope is not a plan. Fiat money often loses buying power over time, while Bitcoin’s limited supply is designed to preserve value for those who hold through cycles. If you’re relying on #Bitcoin to “boom” to make you rich, you’re doing it wrong. Bitcoin is for storing what you earn. The win is time plus stacking. https://t.co/PDdrf3G6nv — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 5, 2026 Price Movements And Political Ties Based on reports, Bitcoin hit a three-week high and traded above $93,000, rising as much as 2.54% on Monday morning. The token cleared its 50-day moving average for the first time since the market tumble that began in early October. Bitcoin is up about 6% so far this year after plunging roughly 22% in the fourth quarter. Ether also moved higher alongside Bitcoin as broader markets rallied. Political events, including the ouster of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro by US special forces and related developments, pushed some investors toward safe-haven assets like gold and silver while not putting a clear dent in appetite for riskier bets like tech stocks. Trading activity and headline news have been linked to short-term moves in crypto prices more than once this year. How Ordinary Investors Should Act According to veteran holders, the mix of steady buying and patience beats timing the market. That is the core of Jeremie’s message. Buy small. Keep adding. Don’t watch the screen every hour. Over time, that habit smooths out the big swings and removes emotional buying at highs and panic selling at lows. Reports indicate many newcomers still treat Bitcoin like a lotto ticket. That mindset fuels big swings. When prices climb, people rush in. When they fall, sellers rush out. The strategy Jeremie described aims to flip that behavior: make accumulation routine, make holding routine.

Based on reports, the gains came from a mix of rate products, equity indexes, commodities and a sharp rise in crypto derivatives. Trading in the fourth quarter averaged over 27 million contracts, while December averaged 23 million, figures that underline a busy year for the exchange operator. Record Annual Volume Reached Interest rate futures and options were the single largest segment, with average daily volume of about 14 million contracts for the year. Equity index contracts added roughly 7.4 million on average each day. Energy trading averaged near 2.7 million contracts, and agricultural products came in around 1.9 million. Metals trading set records too, with roughly 988,000 contracts daily. According to company data and market coverage, these numbers combined to push the overall ADV to the 28.1 million mark.

Some trading days in November produced unusually large single-day tallies for crypto — nearly 795,000 contracts traded on one peak day — and total notional activity in the space reached roughly $12 billion during the year. The steep rise in crypto derivatives helped lift activity outside the more traditional segments and increased the share of international and institutional flows. Monthly Peaks And Seasonal Patterns Monthly data showed several high-water marks. April registered one of the year’s strongest months, with average daily volume near 35.9 million contracts, while November also posted exceptionally high monthly averages above 33 million. Those spikes reflected bouts of market volatility and heavy hedging across asset classes, according to traders and analysts cited in coverage of the figures. Global Reach And Market Mix CME Group’s international average daily volume climbed as well, reaching around 8.4 million contracts for the year. That rise, combined with gains in energy, metals and crypto, made the advance broad-based rather than concentrated in a single sector. The result was a year in which multiple product lines set or matched prior volume records. Trading firms and investors said that shifts in interest-rate views, renewed energy-market activity and the return of strong crypto flows were all factors behind the numbers. The exchange’s published market-statistics package provides the detailed breakdowns, and regulators and market watchers will be parsing the data as they consider liquidity and market structure questions.

The exchange says the program, aimed at users aged six to 17, is built around supervised money lessons and saving habits rather than trading or speculation. A New Frontier in Financial Education The product, called Binance Junior, went live on December 5, 2025. It functions as a restricted sub-account linked to a parent’s main Binance account. The move followed a period of significant growth for the world’s leading crypto exchange, which recently surpassed 300 million registered accounts. In a detailed post on X, a Binance community leader using the handle Sky BNB explained that with Binance Junior, children cannot engage in spot trading, use futures or margin products, or make on-chain withdrawals. Their permitted actions are limited to requesting funds from parents, saving in products like BTC or USDT, using selected “Simple Earn” features to earn interest, and sending limited amounts to friends via Binance Pay. Parents retain comprehensive oversight, with controls over daily limits, real-time notifications, and the ability to freeze or delete the child’s account immediately. Sky BNB framed the service as a necessary response to a digital age where children encounter digital money early but lack understanding. The central claim is that Binance Junior creates a “safe space” for supervised financial learning, focusing on concepts like saving, goal-setting, and the passage of time, all while under full parental control. “It is supervised financial education, not investing,” the post stated, emphasizing that the program is designed to teach discipline and planning rather than profit-seeking. Balancing Innovation with Scrutiny The launch had inevitably sparked conversation about appropriateness and risk. The core question, as highlighted in Sky BNB’s social media post, is whether the initiative is “necessary for children, or are we bringing kids too close to crypto too early?” Proponents within the community argue it is a proactive measure. They suggest that in a future where digital assets are commonplace, early, controlled exposure within a family setting is more responsible than leaving children to discover unregulated platforms on their own. The accompanying “ABCs of Crypto” educational book is cited as providing foundational knowledge most adults never received. Skeptics, however, view the move with caution, questioning the long-term effects of associating childhood financial literacy primarily with cryptocurrency platforms, regardless of the current safeguards. “No, please. Kids don’t need to know about futures,” stated XP Labs founder Tony Katz. “I will never get them involved in that—trading and futures are absolutely not for them. I wouldn’t wish any child to have to study this.” Binance’s defense rests on strictly limiting functionality to curb speculative behavior. “Kids cannot trade. No buying or selling. No winning or losing. This prevents speculation habits,” Sky BNB noted. As this experiment in early-age financial technology unfolds, its reception will hinge on whether the public accepts the distinction between learning about digital money and learning to trade it.

The Chief Investment Officer of Miller Value Partners made this stunning declaration during a recent CNBC interview, anchoring his outlook on converging technical indicators and a shifting regulatory landscape. This analysis provides a comprehensive examination of Miller’s forecast, the underlying market dynamics, and the potential implications for investors navigating the volatile cryptocurrency space. Bill Miller’s Bitcoin Price Prediction and Market Context Bill Miller, a veteran investor renowned for beating the S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years, brings substantial credibility to his Bitcoin price prediction. He specifically addressed the asset’s performance trajectory, dismissing the previous year’s decline as insignificant within its historical volatility pattern. Miller emphasized a critical statistical observation: Bitcoin has never recorded two consecutive years of negative returns since its inception. This historical precedent forms a cornerstone of his 2025 forecast. Furthermore, he pointed to technical indicators that are beginning to align favorably, suggesting the early stages of a new bullish phase. His analysis extends beyond chart patterns, incorporating a macro view of governmental attitudes. Miller explicitly cited a potentially favorable stance from the U.S. government as a key catalyst for Bitcoin’s ascent. This perspective arrives amid ongoing discussions about comprehensive digital asset frameworks and central bank digital currencies. The convergence of technical recovery signals and evolving regulatory clarity creates a unique backdrop for his prediction. Consequently, market participants are scrutinizing this forecast closely, given Miller’s established track record in identifying long-term value. Technical and Historical Analysis Supporting the Forecast Delving deeper into the technical rationale, several on-chain metrics and chart patterns provide context for Miller’s Bitcoin price prediction. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate, a measure of computational security, continues to reach record highs, signaling robust underlying network health. Simultaneously, exchange reserves are declining, indicating a trend of accumulation and withdrawal to long-term storage—a classic bullish signal. From a pure price action perspective, Bitcoin has historically experienced explosive growth phases following periods of consolidation and investor pessimism. The table below summarizes key historical performance cycles relevant to the current forecast: Cycle Period Pre-Consolidation Phase Subsequent Performance Key Catalyst 2014-2017 ~80% Drawdown ~20x Increase to ATH Mainstream Awareness 2018-2021 ~84% Drawdown ~6x Increase to ATH Institutional Adoption 2022-2024 ~77% Drawdown Current Cycle (Pending) Regulatory Clarity & ETFs Miller’s reference to the absence of back-to-back negative years is a powerful statistical anchor. This pattern underscores Bitcoin’s resilient, boom-and-bust nature, where severe corrections are often followed by vigorous recoveries. The current market structure, following a significant drawdown, aligns with historical setups that preceded major rallies. Therefore, his prediction is not merely speculative but rooted in observable, repetitive market behavior. The Regulatory Catalyst and Institutional Perspective Miller’s mention of a favorable U.S. government stance is arguably the most forward-looking element of his Bitcoin price prediction. The regulatory environment for digital assets has been a primary source of uncertainty and volatility. However, recent developments suggest a maturation in approach. The successful launch and substantial asset growth of several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have provided a regulated, accessible pathway for traditional finance. This institutional gateway was a multi-year process, and its current operation represents a major structural change for the asset class. Key factors contributing to a more favorable backdrop include: Clearer Legislative Efforts: Ongoing bipartisan discussions aim to create definitive rules for market structure and consumer protection. Judicial Clarifications: Recent court rulings have helped delineate the boundaries between securities and commodities in the crypto space. Monetary Policy Pivot: Potential shifts in central bank policy away from quantitative tightening could increase liquidity, historically benefiting scarce assets like Bitcoin. From an institutional perspective, managers like Miller view these developments as reducing systemic risk and increasing the investability of Bitcoin. When regulatory fog clears, it typically allows larger pools of capital to enter an asset class with greater confidence. This dynamic could unlock the next wave of institutional demand, directly supporting the path to a new all-time high. Comparative Market Analysis and Risk Considerations While Miller’s Bitcoin price prediction is optimistic, a balanced analysis requires examining countervailing factors and comparable assets. Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum; its performance often correlates with broader risk appetite, technology stock indices, and macroeconomic liquidity conditions. A sustained rise in real interest rates or a severe global recession could pressure all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the competitive landscape within digital assets is fierce. The rise of alternative Layer-1 blockchains and tokenized real-world assets could divert investor attention and capital. Nevertheless, Bitcoin maintains unique properties that bolster Miller’s thesis. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins creates a verifiable scarcity model, especially relevant in an era of expansive fiscal policies. Its brand recognition as the first cryptocurrency grants it a ‘digital gold’ status that newer projects struggle to challenge. Network effects, including its vast mining ecosystem and developer community, create a powerful moat. Therefore, even within a crowded field, Bitcoin’s position as the benchmark reserve asset of the crypto economy appears secure, providing a solid foundation for growth. Conclusion Bill Miller’s Bitcoin price prediction for a new all-time high in 2025 presents a data-driven and historically-informed outlook. His analysis synthesizes technical alignment, favorable historical patterns, and a potentially improving regulatory climate. While cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile and subject to external shocks, the convergence of factors highlighted by a seasoned investor like Miller warrants serious consideration. The trajectory towards a new Bitcoin price peak will likely depend on the continued institutional adoption facilitated by ETFs, clear regulatory progress, and sustained network fundamentals. As 2025 unfolds, market participants will watch closely to see if this stunning forecast materializes, marking another chapter in Bitcoin’s remarkable financial evolution. FAQs Q1: What is Bill Miller’s exact Bitcoin price prediction for 2025? Bill Miller has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) will set a new all-time high in 2025. While he did not specify an exact price target, his forecast is based on aligning technical indicators and a favorable macro-regulatory environment. Q2: What historical pattern does Bill Miller cite to support his Bitcoin forecast? Miller highlights that Bitcoin has never experienced two consecutive calendar years of negative returns in its history. Following a down year, this historical precedent suggests a statistically higher probability of a positive performance year, supporting his bullish 2025 outlook. Q3: How does U.S. government policy factor into this Bitcoin price prediction? Miller stated that a favorable stance from the U.S. government will bolster Bitcoin’s ascent. This likely refers to clearer regulatory frameworks and the successful integration of Bitcoin into traditional finance through vehicles like spot ETFs, which reduce institutional friction. Q4: What are the main risks that could prevent Bitcoin from reaching a new all-time high? Key risks include a severe global economic downturn, a prolonged period of restrictive monetary policy, unexpected harsh regulatory actions from major governments, or a catastrophic security failure within the Bitcoin network or a major exchange. Q5: How does Bill Miller’s track record affect the credibility of this prediction? Bill Miller is a legendary value investor famous for beating the S&P 500 for 15 straight years. His long-term, fundamentals-based approach lends significant credibility to his analysis, though past performance does not guarantee future results, especially in a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency.

Meanwhile, ESG researcher Daniel Batten argues that many criticisms of Bitcoin’s energy use are overstated or unsupported by data, and pointed to peer-reviewed research showing mining does not scale resource consumption with transaction volume and is increasingly powered by sustainable energy. Venezuela Oil Shift May Improve Bitcoin Mining Margins US involvement in Venezuela’s vast oil sector could have meaningful downstream effects for Bitcoin mining economics, even if the impact unfolds slowly. This is according to analysts at Bitfinex. In a recent note, the exchange’s research team said that a potential influx of cheaper and more abundant energy from Venezuelan crude production could eventually improve electricity pricing for Bitcoin miners, which could help ease one of the sector’s most persistent cost pressures and help restore profitability margins that have been squeezed over the past year. The analysts argue that access to lower-cost energy would not only benefit miners directly but could also enable a new phase of global mining expansion, particularly in jurisdictions capable of locking in long-term power contracts. This comes at a time when miners are grappling with a roughly 25% pullback in Bitcoin from its all-time high, rising network difficulty, and elevated electricity costs that have strained balance sheets across the industry. The backdrop to this thesis is a dramatic shift in US policy toward Venezuela. After the seizure of Venezuelan oil tankers in December and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, Washington is expected to move toward tapping the country’s estimated 303 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. Currently, Chevron is the only major US oil producer operating in Venezuela, but US President Donald Trump publicly pushed for other large American energy firms to enter the country and ramp up production. While the long-term potential is exciting, analysts still warn that the timeline is likely to be measured in years rather than months. Bitfinex explained that meaningful increases in output will depend heavily on the political transition process and the removal or easing of lingering sanctions. Matt Mena , a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said restoring Venezuela to its former status as a global production powerhouse could take a decade and require more than $100 billion in infrastructure investment. Venezuela’s decline in oil production has been stark. In the 1970s, the country produced roughly 3.5 million barrels per day, accounting for about 7% of global supply. Today, output has fallen to around 1 million barrels per day, or roughly 1% of global production, thanks to decades of economic mismanagement and political repression. So far, crude prices already reacted to the intervention, with US benchmark oil slipping to about $58 per barrel. While this offers only marginal relief, Bitfinex said any sustained decline in energy prices could incrementally benefit Bitcoin mining operations. Bitcoin Energy Myths Clash With New Research Bitcoin’s environmental impact is also still a point of contention, but ESG researcher Daniel Batten argues that many of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin mining are not supported by evidence. In a recent X thread , Batten said that nine widely repeated claims about Bitcoin’s energy use are contradicted by peer-reviewed research and grid-level data, suggesting the debate is often driven more by misunderstanding than by facts. Daniel Batten X post Batten’s comments were made amid sustained criticism from major media outlets. In November, Dow Jones criticized Harvard University for allocating a portion of its endowment to Bitcoin by describing the asset as environmentally catastrophic. Earlier in the year, Bloomberg claimed Bitcoin consumes electricity intended for the world’s poorest populations. While some environmental researchers still raise concerns about indirect emissions and opportunity costs, Batten argues that these claims rarely actually align with available data. One of the central myths, according to Batten, is that Bitcoin’s energy, water, and e-waste usage scales with transaction volume. He pointed to multiple peer-reviewed studies summarized in the University of Cambridge 2025 Digital Mining Industry Report, which found that Bitcoin’s resource use is largely independent of transaction throughput. This means the network can process more transactions without a proportional increase in energy consumption. He also rejected claims that Bitcoin mining destabilizes power grids by arguing that flexible mining operations can help balance supply and demand, particularly on renewable-heavy grids like those in Texas. Batten further disputed that Bitcoin mining raises electricity prices for everyday consumers, and said there is no peer-reviewed evidence to support the claim and that some data suggests miners can actually help lower costs during periods of excess supply. (Source: X ) Comparisons between Bitcoin’s energy use and that of entire countries were described as misleading, especially in light of guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which emphasizes decarbonizing energy sources rather than simply reducing energy consumption. He also challenged the idea that proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum are inherently more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin, and argued that conflating energy use with environmental harm overlooks Bitcoin mining’s ability to mitigate methane emissions, stabilize grids, and monetize wasted renewable energy. According to Batten, Bitcoin is one of the few global industries with robust third-party data showing it has crossed the 50% sustainable energy threshold.",News|Crypto,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Notably, this latest purchase brings the company’s total holdings to nearly 680,000 BTC, with current figures standing at 672,497 BTC. Bitcoin Buys Vs. Stock Struggles Analysts, including Lirrato on the social media platform X, revealed that the company acquired 22,498 BTC in December alone. To reach the target of 680,000 BTC by January, Strategy needs only 7,503 more coins—an amount they surpassed last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches $93,000 Amid Renewed Optimism: What To Keep An Eye On This Week However, despite this bullish acquisition, the company’s stock (MSTR) has experienced a significant decline, plummeting by over 50% throughout 2025 to its current trading price of around $163 on Monday. Adding to the challenges facing Strategy, the firm could be just ten days away from being delisted from the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index, awaiting for the formal announcement. In an October proposal, MSCI indicated that firms holding digital assets amounting to 50% or more of their total assets should be removed from its global benchmarks. This move was justified by MSCI’s assertion that these firms resemble investment funds, which are excluded from its indexes. Strategy Braces For Potential Financial Turmoil Presently, MSCI is conducting a public consultation, and if it determines that Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies like Strategy should be excluded, it could set a precedent that other index providers might follow. In a public letter, Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, and co-founder Michael Saylor discussed the possible implications of an MSCI exclusion. They estimated that such a decision could lead to around $2.8 billion worth of the company’s stock being liquidated, creating a potential chilling effect across the entire industry. Analysts from TD Cowen highlighted that approximately $2.5 billion of Strategy’s market value is tied to MSCI, while an additional $5.5 billion hinges on other indexes. JPMorgan’s analysis suggests that if MSCI were to exclude Strategy, the company could face $2.8 billion in outflows, a number that could escalate to $8.8 billion if it were delisted from additional indexes, including the Nasdaq 100, the CRSP US Total Market Index, and various Russell indexes owned by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Related Reading: Consumer Crypto Spending Grows in 2026 as Visa Reports Major Card Growth Alongside these potential challenges, Strategy may soon have to contend with substantial financial losses that starkly contrast the $2.8 billion profit they reported in the previous year’s third quarter. Additionally, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates that Michael Saylor has seen his personal wealth diminish dramatically during this downturn, dropping approximately 40% to about $3.8 billion. Nevertheless, on Monday, cryptocurrency prices saw a notable recovery, with Bitcoin and other digital assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL) and XRP climbing back above key levels, sparking a new wave of optimism among investors.

Here’s how much the treasury firm has added to each. Strategy Has Increased Both Its Bitcoin & USD Treasuries As revealed in an X post by co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy has added 1,287 BTC to its Bitcoin treasury. In total, this acquisition cost the company $116.3 million, according to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Strategy didn’t buy all of this stack in 2026; it purchased 3 BTC between December 29th and 31st, and 1,283 BTC between January 1st and 4th. After these additions, the firm’s Bitcoin reserves have grown to 673,783 tokens. The BTC acquisition isn’t all that Saylor has announced. At the start of last month, the company started a new USD reserve as a way of making sure that dividend payments occur in time regardless of short-term volatility in the market. It has just made another expansion to this reserve. Initially, the firm allocated $1.44 billion to the USD reserve, with a $748 million addition coming a couple of weeks ago. Now, it has raised it further by $62 million, taking the total to $2.25 billion. Strategy has funded this expansion and the latest BTC purchase using sales of its MSTR at-the-market (ATM) stock offering. Strategy is currently by far the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, as the below table from BitcoinTreasuries.net shows. The company’s 673,783 BTC stack is today worth $63.48 billion, more than 25% above its cost basis of $50.55 billion. Though, while Strategy has done well overall, 2025 wasn’t such a bright year for it. The SEC filing states that the treasury firm closed December 31st with an unrealized loss of $5.40 billion on its digital asset holdings. The figure for the fourth quarter alone is even worse: an unrealized loss of $17.44 billion. The bad 2025 is naturally a result of the bearish price action that Bitcoin and the wider digital asset sector faced between October and November. Nonetheless, Strategy still hasn’t sold any coins and its recent purchases suggest it’s committed to growing the treasury further for now. In some other news, the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw the highest amount of net inflows since October last week. Spot ETFs are financial instruments that allow investors to gain indirect exposure to BTC’s price movements. That is, they allow traders a route into the cryptocurrency that’s off-chain. Some traditional investors and institutional entities prefer to invest into the asset this way. Much like the spot on-chain demand, spot ETFs have also faced weak netflows since October, but last week diverged from the recent trend with net inflows of $458.77 million. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $94,200, up 8% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|Strategy|Strategy USD Reserve,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Ether has now gained 16% since the beginning of this year, which is not even a week old yet. It has outperformed Bitcoin, which is only up 6.7% since New Year’s Day. “Ethereum is still cheap,” said analyst ‘Merlijn’ who observed that it is still in accumulation territory. “We’re not in ‘Take Profit’ territory.

In its latest update on Monday, the world’s largest Ether digital asset treasury, BitMine, revealed that it has already staked a whopping $2.1 billion worth of ETH in just two weeks. As of January 4, the company’s total staked ETH stands at 659,219, an increase of 250,592 in the past week. BitMine’s stake equates to around 1.85% of the total amount of Ether staked on the Beacon Chain, which is currently 35.6 million. Its aggressive staking has caused the validator entry queue to surge to 1.3 million ETH, its highest level since mid-November. Meanwhile, the exit queue has fallen back to July levels, near zero. BitMine is currently working with three staking providers as the company moves towards unveiling its commercial MAVAN (Made in America VAlidator Network) in 2026. “At scale (when Bitmine’s ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking fee is $374 million annually, or greater than $1 million per day,” stated chairman Tom Lee. Earlier in January, BitMine asked its shareholders to approve a massive increase in its authorized shares. Grayscale Distributes Staking Rewards In addition to DATs, staking demand is also coming from US spot Ether exchange-traded funds. On Monday, Grayscale became the first spot crypto ETF to distribute staking rewards. “Spot ETH ETFs didn’t even exist a year and a half ago … Now [they’re] making *staking* distributions to investors,” said ETF expert Nate Geraci. “Wild how far the crypto ETF space has come in a short amount of time.” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyfart said spot Ether ETFs were “doing okay considering the price performance of ETH, but they’ve seen 18% of their flows leave.” The post Ethereum Topped $3,250 in Recovery as BitMine Stakes Over $2B ETH appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Ethereum|Ethereum (ETH) Price|Ethereum ETF|Staking|Tom Lee,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This equilibrium in BTC perpetual futures positioning suggests a market at a potential inflection point, where institutional and retail sentiment appears cautiously divided despite recent price movements. Market analysts typically scrutinize these ratios for directional clues, as they reflect real-time trader positioning without expiration dates influencing decisions. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Market Dynamics Perpetual futures represent a cornerstone of cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Unlike traditional futures contracts, these instruments lack expiration dates. Traders maintain positions indefinitely while paying funding rates periodically. These rates balance long and short positions between counterparties. The long/short ratio specifically measures the percentage of traders holding bullish versus bearish positions across exchanges. Consequently, this metric provides valuable sentiment indicators for market participants. Major platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bybit dominate this market segment with substantial open interest. Recent data shows aggregate positioning at 50.52% long versus 49.48% short. This near-perfect balance indicates neither bulls nor bears possess overwhelming conviction currently. Individual exchange breakdowns reveal subtle variations in trader psychology. For instance, Binance shows 50.56% long positions against 49.44% short positions. Similarly, OKX demonstrates 51.16% long versus 48.84% short positioning. Meanwhile, Bybit displays the most bullish tilt at 51.25% long against 48.75% short. These minor differences reflect varying trader demographics and regional market influences across platforms. The Mechanics of Perpetual Futures Funding Rates Funding mechanisms maintain perpetual contract prices near underlying spot prices. Typically, exchanges calculate funding rates every eight hours. When long positions dominate, longs pay shorts to encourage equilibrium. Conversely, shorts pay longs during bearish dominance. Current balanced ratios suggest minimal funding rate pressure. This stability reduces trading costs for participants. However, sudden ratio shifts could trigger funding rate volatility. Therefore, traders monitor these metrics for both sentiment and cost management purposes. Historical Context and Market Implications Historical analysis reveals significant patterns in long/short ratio behavior. Extreme readings often precede market reversals. For example, ratios above 60% long frequently indicated overcrowded bullish trades. Similarly, ratios below 40% long signaled excessive bearish sentiment. Current neutral positioning suggests several possible market scenarios. First, traders might await clearer macroeconomic signals. Second, institutional players could be hedging existing spot positions. Third, retail traders may demonstrate uncertainty about near-term direction. Comparative data from previous months shows interesting evolution. In January 2025, aggregate ratios hovered around 48% long following regulatory announcements. February saw a surge to 55% long during Bitcoin’s rally toward $70,000. The current return to equilibrium indicates profit-taking and position rebalancing. Notably, exchange-specific differences persist due to varying user bases. Binance’s global retail dominance creates different dynamics than OKX’s institutional focus. Bybit’s aggressive retail traders often exhibit stronger directional biases. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Comparison (March 15, 2025) Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Open Interest Rank Binance 50.56% 49.44% 1 OKX 51.16% 48.84% 2 Bybit 51.25% 48.75% 3 Aggregate 50.52% 49.48% – Expert Perspectives on Current Positioning Derivatives analysts emphasize several key observations about current ratios. First, balanced positioning reduces liquidation cascade risks. Second, neutral sentiment allows for organic price discovery. Third, institutional hedging activity might mask true directional bias. Veteran traders recall that similar equilibrium periods in 2023 preceded significant volatility expansions. However, correlation with spot market flows remains crucial for accurate interpretation. Market makers currently report balanced order books across exchanges. Regulatory developments also influence derivatives trading behavior. The 2024 MiCA implementation in Europe altered exchange operations. Similarly, US regulatory clarity affected product offerings. Asian markets continue demonstrating unique characteristics. These regional differences explain exchange-specific ratio variations. For instance, OKX’s stronger Asian institutional presence creates different patterns than Binance’s global distribution. Bybit’s focus on leveraged retail products attracts more aggressive positioning. Technical and Fundamental Correlations BTC perpetual futures ratios demonstrate strong correlations with several market metrics. Funding rate analysis confirms neutral sentiment currently. Open interest levels remain near all-time highs despite balanced positioning. This suggests high participation with divided opinions. Spot market volumes show moderate activity without clear direction. Options market skew indicates slight put protection buying. These combined signals paint a picture of cautious market participation. Macroeconomic factors increasingly influence cryptocurrency derivatives. Interest rate expectations affect leverage costs. Dollar strength impacts global capital flows. Equity market correlations have strengthened recently. Geopolitical events create volatility expectations. Traders must consider these interconnected factors. Therefore, isolated ratio analysis provides limited insight without broader context. The current equilibrium likely reflects multiple cross-currents in global markets. Funding Rates: Currently neutral across all major exchanges Open Interest: Maintains elevated levels despite balanced ratios Liquidation Levels: Clustered around recent price ranges Volume Patterns: Show typical cyclical behavior without extremes Institutional Activity: Reported as balanced between hedging and speculation Risk Management Considerations for Traders Balanced long/short ratios present unique risk management scenarios. First, reduced funding costs benefit both positions. Second, liquidation risks decrease without extreme positioning. Third, volatility expectations might increase after consolidation periods. Professional traders often interpret equilibrium as preparation for directional moves. However, timing such transitions remains challenging. Position sizing becomes crucial during uncertain periods. Diversification across exchanges can mitigate platform-specific risks. Historical volatility analysis provides additional context. Similar ratio patterns in Q3 2024 preceded a 25% price movement within two weeks. Current implied volatility metrics suggest expectations for increased movement. Options market term structure shows slight contango. These technical indicators support potential volatility expansion. Nevertheless, directional bias remains unclear from derivatives data alone. Spot market accumulation patterns might provide clearer signals. Market Structure and Exchange Differences Exchange-specific characteristics explain ratio variations effectively. Binance’s massive user base creates mean-reverting tendencies. OKX’s institutional tools attract sophisticated hedging strategies. Bybit’s interface appeals to technical retail traders. These demographic differences produce consistent pattern variations. Understanding these nuances improves ratio interpretation. For example, Bybit’s slightly more bullish reading aligns with its user base’s historical tendencies. Similarly, OKX’s institutional focus creates more measured positioning. Product offerings also influence positioning behavior. Exchange-specific leverage limits affect maximum position sizes. Margin requirements differ across platforms. Insurance fund mechanisms vary significantly. These structural elements create different risk environments. Consequently, identical market views might produce different positioning decisions. Advanced traders often compare ratios across exchanges for deeper insights. They identify anomalies that might signal emerging trends. The Role of Market Makers and Liquidity Providers Professional liquidity providers significantly influence reported ratios. Market making strategies often involve balanced exposures. Their participation can mask true speculative positioning. However, current data suggests genuine trader equilibrium. Market maker activity appears normal without unusual hedging. Order book depth remains healthy across exchanges. Bid-ask spreads maintain tight levels typically. These indicators suggest normal market functioning despite balanced sentiment. Institutional participation has grown substantially since 2023. Hedge funds now actively trade cryptocurrency derivatives. Asset managers use these products for portfolio hedging. Corporations employ them for treasury management. This diversification of participants creates more complex sentiment patterns. Traditional market analysis techniques require adaptation for crypto derivatives. The current equilibrium might reflect sophisticated institutional strategies rather than simple retail sentiment. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio reveals crucial market equilibrium across major exchanges. Current balanced positioning suggests cautious trader sentiment and potential volatility expansion. Exchange-specific variations reflect differing user demographics and product structures. Historical patterns indicate that similar equilibrium periods often precede significant price movements. However, directional bias remains unclear from derivatives data alone. Traders should monitor spot market flows and macroeconomic developments for clearer signals. The BTC perpetual futures market continues maturing with increasing institutional participation and sophisticated trading strategies. FAQs Q1: What does a balanced BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio indicate? A balanced ratio near 50/50 suggests market indecision and equal conviction between bullish and bearish traders. It often occurs during consolidation periods or before significant volatility events. Q2: Why do long/short ratios differ across cryptocurrency exchanges? Ratios vary due to differing user demographics, product offerings, leverage limits, and regional market influences. Each exchange attracts distinct trader types with varying risk appetites and strategies. Q3: How do funding rates relate to long/short ratios? Funding rates balance perpetual contract prices with spot prices. When long positions dominate, longs pay funding to shorts. Balanced ratios typically result in neutral funding rates, reducing trading costs. Q4: Can long/short ratios predict Bitcoin price movements? While not perfect predictors, extreme ratios often signal overcrowded trades and potential reversals. Balanced ratios suggest uncertainty rather than clear directional bias for future prices. Q5: How frequently should traders monitor these ratios? Serious derivatives traders typically check ratios daily alongside funding rates, open interest, and liquidation levels. Significant changes often warrant position adjustments or increased monitoring.

Miller, the son of veteran investor Bill Miller, played down the idea that Venezuela will shape the long-term path for crypto prices. “Well, I think Venezuela is going to be a blip on the radar in the long run,” he said, arguing that bigger forces matter more for Bitcoin’s next move. He framed Bitcoin as a way to own an asset geared to long-running monetary trends. “Disinflation has been the story of economic history for 800 years, which is why Bitcoin is a particularly interesting asset to own,” he said, adding that the market has reached what he sees as an inflection point.

HODL pic.twitter.com/E3iAa3leN7 — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) January 5, 2026 Bitcoin’s 2025 Dip Looks Minor In Context Of Long-Term Volatility Miller pointed to a shift in regulatory tone over the past year and a broader embrace of blockchain infrastructure by mainstream finance. In his view, that backdrop has changed the playbook for investors trying to size the next leg of the cycle. On price action, he said the setup looks constructive again. “It looks like it’s ready to go again,” he said. “I personally expect it to break out to a higher high than its all-time high from the fall.” Miller brushed off Bitcoin’s weak stretch in 2025 as noise relative to its history. “It was down 6% in 2025. For an asset with that level of volatility over the long run, that’s not a big deal,” he said, urging investors to zoom out and view Bitcoin and gold through the same macro lens. Miller Sees Value In Strategy After Stock’s Sharp Pullback He then explained how he prefers to express that view in public markets, pointing first to Strategy, the company known for using leverage and capital markets to build large Bitcoin holdings. He said the stock’s recent underperformance has improved its valuation appeal. Miller said Strategy now trades close to its net asset value and he does not expect meaningful downside from those levels. He added that the company’s structure provides leveraged exposure to Bitcoin, which could allow it to outperform if crypto markets turn decisively risk on.

The firm’s Washington Research Group warned that ongoing political dynamics in Congress make swift enactment this year unlikely — and could stretch implementation as far out as 2029 . Based on their argument, this situation has increased the chances of delays despite analysts’ assertions that a crypto market structure bill could be passed this year. Jaret Seiberg, managing director of TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, weighed in on the topic of discussion. In a note dated Monday, January 5, Seiberg pointed out that Democrats may take time to act, especially if they believe that the 2026 midterm elections can enable them to reclaim control of the House. “Since election results are always uncertain, Democrats might decide to make a deal,” Seiberg wrote. “This could happen soon because staff have been preparing the technical details for several months.” Lawmakers raise concerns about the participation of Trump’s family in the crypto industry Following the current situation , Seiberg declared that there is sufficient time to pass the bill, arguing that if the bill receives approval from the relevant authorities as anticipated in 2027 and is implemented in 2029, then all the challenges faced will be resolved. He also noted that the crypto community must understand that the presidential election has a great impact on the ultimate regulations. For Democrats, Seiberg noted that they need to grasp the fact that the conflict provision will not apply to US President Donald Trump. Seiberg has also predicted that conflict-of-interest regulations will be a major challenge. To facilitate better understanding, he elaborated that there is a high likelihood that Democrats will strongly support rules that restrict senior government officials and their families, including Trump, from operating or owning cryptocurrency businesses. According to him, such conditions would act as a “nonstarter”, particularly for Trump, unless they were delayed for some years. In the meantime, a reliable source highlighted that the US president generated around $620 million last July, derived from crypto-related activities connected to his family, including World Liberty Financial, a DeFi and stablecoin project. Following this news, a thorough investigation was conducted, revealing that Trump, along with his three sons, was the co-founder of these activities. The investigation also disclosed that the family made significant investments in American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining and acquisition firm. Interestingly, this investment was made at a time when lawmakers began raising concerns regarding the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins. It is worth noting that these meme coins were introduced just before Trump assumed the presidency of the United States. “One possible way to address Trump’s concerns is by making the conflict of interest rule start three years after it becomes law,” Seiberg explained. “This would push it beyond the next inauguration, which means it wouldn’t affect Trump at all. We think Democrats would only agree to this if the rest of the bill was also delayed for three years.” Individuals express optimism about the passage of the crypto market structure bill soon Crypto market structure legislation is perceived as a significant breakthrough in regulation, following the passage of the GENIUS Act , which marked the United States’ first major legislative step towards regulating stablecoins. The primary objective of this legislation is to establish a straightforward system that outlines how relevant authorities in the country manage digital assets. This scrutiny will also include oversight by agencies and the classification of assets. What has delayed the passage of this market structure bill is that the progress in the Senate stopped after the House passed its version of the bill last year. However, hope has been sparked in the ecosystem after it was confirmed that committees in the Senate are anticipated to hold discussions regarding the bill later this year. Notably, for a Senate filibuster to be successfully overcome, 60 votes are needed. This situation implies that Republicans will require backing from at least seven Democrats, even if each Republican decides to support the bill. In reality, Seiberg claimed that there is a possibility that they might require about eight or nine Democratic votes, as some Republicans have demonstrated a likelihood of opposing this legislation.

BTC Defends Rising Trendline as Breakout Versus Pullback Battle Tightens BTC is still trading above a long rising support line on the 1D Binance chart, and the latest bounce kept the structure intact. That matters because this trendline has acted as a “decision level” multiple times. Each retest that holds typically resets momentum, while a clean break usually shifts the market into a deeper correction phase. Bitcoin Uptrend Line Retests on Daily Chart. Source: ( Crypto King ) The current price area near $93,700 sits above that rising support and below the next big psychological zone. This creates a squeeze setup. If BTC keeps printing higher lows above the trendline, buyers keep control and the market can grind into the next resistance band. However, if price stalls and returns to the trendline again too quickly, the line becomes weaker, because repeated tests often reduce the amount of resting buy liquidity. From here, the chart points to three practical paths. First, continuation: BTC holds above the trendline and clears the nearest swing highs, which would signal that demand is absorbing supply from the last selloff. In that case, momentum traders often target round number resistance next, because it concentrates orders. Second, range: BTC chops between the trendline and overhead resistance, building a base and delaying a breakout. That usually shows up as tight candles and lower volatility. Third, breakdown: BTC closes below the trendline and fails to reclaim it on a retest. That sequence often flips the former support into resistance and opens the door to the next demand zone, typically the prior consolidation area on the way up.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The prominent cryptocurrency executive argues that political calculations ahead of crucial American elections will force increased dollar printing, consequently driving capital toward decentralized digital assets as traditional fiat systems face mounting pressure. Bitcoin Rally Fundamentals: Geopolitics Meets Monetary Policy Arthur Hayes recently published a detailed analysis connecting Washington’s Venezuela strategy to cryptocurrency market dynamics. The former BitMEX CEO suggests that the Trump administration faces conflicting economic objectives that will resolve through currency devaluation. Specifically, Hayes identifies three interconnected policy goals that create this monetary dilemma: Oil price suppression to maintain consumer economic confidence Economic stimulation ahead of the 2026 midterm elections Sustained growth momentum through the 2028 presidential campaign These objectives, according to Hayes’ assessment, cannot simultaneously exist without significant expansion of the dollar supply. The Federal Reserve would essentially face pressure to accommodate fiscal spending through monetary policy adjustments. Historical precedent supports this analysis, as similar patterns emerged during previous election cycles with expansive fiscal packages. Venezuela’s Strategic Position in Global Energy Markets Venezuela possesses the world’s largest proven oil reserves, exceeding 300 billion barrels according to OPEC data. This resource wealth gives the South American nation outsized influence in global energy markets despite its current economic challenges. The United States has maintained various sanctions against Venezuela’s petroleum sector since 2019, creating ongoing tension between energy security objectives and foreign policy goals. Recent diplomatic developments suggest potential policy shifts that could impact global oil flows. Any substantial change in Venezuela’s export capacity would directly affect petroleum prices worldwide. Lower energy costs typically support consumer spending and economic growth metrics, both politically advantageous outcomes for incumbent administrations. However, achieving these price reductions often requires complex geopolitical maneuvering with monetary consequences. Expert Analysis: The Dollar Printing Mechanism Monetary economists have long documented the relationship between geopolitical stabilization efforts and currency expansion. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a senior fellow at the Center for Monetary Studies, explains this dynamic: “When nations pursue foreign policy objectives that require economic support, central banks frequently face pressure to accommodate resulting fiscal expenditures. This creates what economists call ‘fiscal dominance’ scenarios.” Hayes extends this analysis specifically to cryptocurrency markets. He notes that previous periods of dollar supply expansion, particularly following the 2020 pandemic response, correlated strongly with Bitcoin appreciation. The cryptocurrency’s fixed supply of 21 million coins creates scarcity characteristics that contrast sharply with expandable fiat currencies. This fundamental difference becomes increasingly significant during periods of monetary expansion. Cryptocurrency as Alternative Store of Value Bitcoin’s design incorporates several features that position it as potential digital gold during currency devaluation periods. The cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature removes it from direct government control, while its verifiable scarcity provides transparency lacking in traditional monetary systems. These characteristics attract investors concerned about currency debasement, particularly when expansionary policies become apparent. Historical data reveals interesting patterns. During the 2020-2021 period of significant monetary expansion, Bitcoin appreciated approximately 500% against the US dollar. While correlation doesn’t imply causation, the timing suggests investors recognized the cryptocurrency’s potential as an inflation hedge. Similar dynamics could emerge if Hayes’ predictions about renewed dollar printing materialize. Historical Monetary Expansion and Bitcoin Performance Period M2 Money Supply Growth Bitcoin Price Change 2020-2021 +27% +500% 2017-2018 +6% +1300% 2019-2020 +24% +300% Hayes’ Personal Investment Strategy Shift Beyond his macroeconomic predictions, Arthur Hayes revealed significant adjustments to his personal cryptocurrency portfolio. The investor disclosed reallocating from Bitcoin to privacy-focused altcoins, specifically mentioning increased positions in Zcash (ZEC). Additionally, Hayes reported reducing Ethereum holdings to increase exposure to decentralized finance (DeFi) assets. This strategic shift reflects Hayes’ assessment of sector rotation opportunities within cryptocurrency markets. He believes privacy technologies will attract substantial attention throughout 2025, potentially outperforming broader market indices. This perspective aligns with increasing regulatory discussions about financial privacy rights in digital asset ecosystems. Technical Analysis Versus Geopolitical Complexity Hayes offers specific advice to cryptocurrency investors navigating these complex dynamics. He emphasizes focusing on technical indicators and liquidity metrics rather than attempting to predict geopolitical developments. This approach recognizes that market prices ultimately reflect aggregated information, including geopolitical risks, through trading activity. Key metrics Hayes recommends monitoring include exchange liquidity depths, derivatives market positioning, and on-chain transaction volumes. These indicators provide objective data about market sentiment and potential price movements. By concentrating on measurable factors, investors can make informed decisions despite geopolitical uncertainty. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Implications The potential connection between Venezuela policy and cryptocurrency markets extends beyond Bitcoin alone. Alternative cryptocurrencies, particularly those with privacy features or DeFi applications, could experience disproportionate effects. Market analysts note that during previous periods of monetary uncertainty, investors frequently diversified across multiple digital assets rather than concentrating exclusively on Bitcoin. This diversification pattern reflects the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s maturation. Investors now recognize distinct value propositions across different blockchain projects, from privacy preservation to decentralized lending protocols. These specialized applications may respond differently to macroeconomic stimuli than Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Conclusion Arthur Hayes presents a logically structured argument connecting US Venezuela policy to potential Bitcoin appreciation through monetary transmission mechanisms. His analysis rests on established economic principles linking geopolitical objectives to currency expansion, particularly during election-sensitive periods. While predictions inherently involve uncertainty, the fundamental relationship between dollar printing and alternative asset appreciation remains historically documented. The coming months will reveal whether Hayes’ Bitcoin rally prediction materializes as geopolitical and monetary policies evolve. FAQs Q1: How exactly would US policy on Venezuela lead to more dollar printing? The theory suggests that maintaining low oil prices while stimulating the economy requires conflicting policies that ultimately resolve through fiscal spending accommodated by monetary expansion, increasing dollar supply. Q2: What historical evidence supports the connection between dollar printing and Bitcoin prices? Periods of significant monetary expansion, particularly in 2020-2021, correlated strongly with Bitcoin appreciation, though correlation doesn’t guarantee future repetition of this pattern. Q3: Why is Arthur Hayes moving from Bitcoin to altcoins if he predicts a Bitcoin rally? Hayes believes certain cryptocurrency sectors, particularly privacy technologies, may outperform Bitcoin during specific market phases, representing a portfolio diversification strategy rather than abandonment of Bitcoin’s potential. Q4: How reliable are predictions based on geopolitical developments? Geopolitical predictions involve substantial uncertainty, which is why Hayes recommends focusing on technical analysis and liquidity metrics rather than attempting to forecast political outcomes. Q5: What specific indicators should investors monitor according to Hayes’ advice? Key metrics include exchange liquidity depths, derivatives market positioning, on-chain transaction volumes, and other technical indicators that provide objective market data.

The incident became a talking point within crypto circles after a report from Bitcoin Magazine alleged that the DOJ, through the US Marshals Service, had quietly liquidated roughly $6.3 million worth of Bitcoin on Nov. 3, 2025. According to on-chain data cited in the report , the BTC in question was transferred from a bech32 address associated with the Samourai Wallet founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, to a wallet belonging to Coinbase Prime. The Bitcoin was forfeited as part of the developers’ plea deal with the government. After the first transfer to the Coinbase Prime wallet address 3Lz5U, the funds were subsequently sent to another wallet within the same brokerage cluster, identified as 1AaFQ. The report argued that, taken together, the transfer represents a sale of approximately $6.3 million (based on prices at the time) and stands in direct violation of Executive Order (EO) 14233 that came into effect earlier this year. The March executive order Trump signed the executive order in March 2025 as a part of the United States’ plans to hoard Bitcoin seized from criminal and civil forfeitures within a national Bitcoin reserve. Per the order, any seized BTC would be used to fund the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and explicitly prohibits the sale of any assets held within the reserve . US Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and co-sponsor of the BITCOIN Act proposing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, has also spoken up about the matter and publicly condemned the move, even though no official announcements regarding such a sale have been made. “We can’t afford to squander these strategic assets while other nations are accumulating bitcoin. I’m deeply concerned about this report,” Lummis wrote in a Jan. 6 X post. Patrick Witt, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, has also taken note of the incident and confirmed that the Trump administration is looking into the transfer. On-chain data tells a different story Based on blockchain data alone, it may be premature to conclude that the funds were liquidated, as Coinbase Prime is known to internally sweep addresses as a part of standard operational behavior. The original report stated that the Coinbase Prime address showed zero balance after the transfer was made, which doesn’t automatically imply that a sale took place. While many argue that transfers to prime brokerage addresses are typically done to liquidate assets, it doesn’t definitively prove they were sold for dollars yet. Some are even speculating that the DOJ might argue they are simply using Coinbase for custody. However, the mention of an “asset liquidation agreement” in internal documents has sparked further suspicion. As it is a government-controlled wallet transfer, to confirm any sale would require official court filings, custodian records, or public statements from the agency. During past large-scale seizures, such as the Silk Road BTC, the government has announced upcoming auctions , allowing the market to prepare for a bulk sale. If true, the quiet handling of this transaction would mark a departure from previous protocols and may prompt increased scrutiny from lawmakers and the crypto industry alike.

Collectively, they oversee about $22 trillion in assets — or about the GDP of the entire Eurozone — and occupy systemically important roles in global markets. Here’s what they predict in the new year. BlackRock Stablecoins will challenge governments’ control over their domestic currencies, BlackRock said in its annual outlook for global markets in 2026. As adoption of stablecoin surges, there’s a risk that the use of domestic currencies in emerging markets will decline, BlackRock said. The prediction comes on the heels of UK bank Standard Chartered cautioning in October that stablecoin adoption could drain over $1 trillion from bank accounts in emerging markets. Vitalik Buterin warns of two threats to Ethereum if BlackRock gets any bigger Beware of BlackRock and its ilk. A similar argument can be said for US banks. They are threatened by the new Genius Act, the landmark stablecoin bill that was signed into law in July and gives crypto companies yield-like incentives that traditional lenders aren’t permitted to offer. “Stablecoins are no longer niche,” Samara Cohen, global head of market development at BlackRock, said. “They’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity.” Coinbase The deployment of artificial intelligence will catalyse an economic boom not yet captured by statistics, Coinbase investment research head David Duong said in the exchange’s 2026 Market Outlook report. He argued that the growth of AI is unlike that of previous tech boom-and-bust cycles. “We see the sustained prominence of the AI [and] crypto convergence as not just a trend but as a fundamental shift towards the next stage of technological progress,” Duong said. The demand for privacy tokens will skyrocket, as “a growing global awareness of digital surveillance and data exploitation has raised the profile of privacy-first payment solutions,” Duong said. The company highlights Ethereum’s privacy-focused initiative and tokens such as Zcash and Monero. How to go private, decentralised and open source in 2026 — just like Vitalik Buterin In 2025, privacy came full circle. Fidelity More and more countries will buy Bitcoin in 2026, Fidelity, the $6 trillion asset manager, said . Fidelity named Brazil and Kyrgyzstan as two countries that have recently passed legislation enabling the purchase of Bitcoin for national reserves. “If more countries adopt bitcoin as part of their foreign exchange reserves, then the pressure for other countries to also do it could increase, as they may feel competitive pressure,” said Chris Kuiper, vice president of research. And Fidelity is not the only institution anticipating a sovereign buying spree. Strategy CEO of the Bitcoin-buying business firm Strategy, Phong Le, has also predicted that countries will buy Bitcoin in 2026. “Bank adoption, nation state adoption, is going to increase,” he said. JPMorgan Crypto will keep posting big wins in 2026, according to JPMorgan’s market outlook. Despite the market having shaved roughly $1 trillion off of its total value, which once stood at $4 trillion in 2025, JPMorgan says the industry is still well-placed thanks to more lenient regulations in the US. The Wall Street giant also noted that stablecoins are becoming a force in their own right. “Broadly, we see digital assets gaining favour, driven in part by the search — at the margin — for alternatives to the dollar,’ JPMorgan wrote. Andreessen Horowitz AI agents in 2026 will revolutionise internet payments and banking, according to Andreessen Horowitz. The firm predicts AI agents will be “paying each other for data, GPU time, or API calls instantly and permissionlessly — without invoicing, reconciling, or batching.” A16z also predicts that privacy “will be the most important moat in crypto.” “Privacy also does something more important: It creates chain lock-in; a privacy network effect, if you will,” it said. The top DeFi trends to watch out for in 2026 Last year, DL News attempted to predict the top three DeFi trends for 2025. DefiLlama, DL Research, DL News Regulatory clarity catapulted stablecoins into the mainstream in 2025, DefiLlama, DL Research and DL News wrote in our joint State of DeFi report in December. While the US and the EU have already provided clarity with the Genius Act and MiCA , other jurisdictions are set to follow in 2026, the report says . “This regulatory alignment should accelerate the arrival of non-USD stablecoins and open the door for a new wave of institutional issuers entering digital assets at scale,” the report says. DAOs grew quieter and more concentrated in 2025: ‘State of DeFi’ report Decentralised autonomous organisations, or DAOs, grew quieter and less decentralised in 2025. Galaxy Digital Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2027, Galaxy Digital said . “Options markets are currently pricing about equal odds of $70,000 or $130,000 for month-end June 2026, and equal odds of $50,000 or $250,000 by year-end 2026,” the firm predicted. Galaxy also predicts that stablecoins will overtake ACH, the existing banking transaction system, in transaction volume. The crypto asset manager also predicts that privacy-linked tokens will smash $100 billion in value by the end of 2026. “The suits and ties have arrived,” the pair said. “Corporate adoption of crypto is accelerating confidence on both sides of the market.” VanEck Digital assets in 2026 will see consolidation rather than a boom or collapse, predicts Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, the investment firm that had $161 billion in assets under management in September. According to Sigel, Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle remains intact. While not an immediate threat, quantum security is also becoming a key theme in the Bitcoin community, Sigel said. The firm recommends its clients to invest between 1% and 3% of their portfolios into the top crypto. Bitcoin miner capitulation auspicious for $2tn digital asset, says VanEck. Here’s why Bitcoin’s historically rising prices Pantera Capital US crypto policy will decisively shift from uncertainty to implementation, with Washington assertively creating new rules, according to Pantera Capital. Chief legal officer Katrina Paglia said the regulatory reset under the Trump administration has clarified the industry’s direction of travel in 2026, even as key questions remain unresolved. Key dates for US crypto regulation in 2026 — ‘We are closer than ever’ This past year saw a US crypto policy revolution. She points to the Genius Act, which establishes a licensing and supervisory regime for payment stablecoins, as setting a key stage for 2026. “Crypto has almost doubled, on average, each year for the 12 years we’ve managed money in the space,” the company said. OKX Ventures Next year will be the year more assets go onchain, according to Jeff Ren, founder of OKX Ventures. Speaking with DL News in December, he said that he expects gold , stocks, intellectual property and even GPUs to have blockchain-based representation. “The goal isn’t to invent new things to speculate on, but to package familiar risks — rates, oil prices, elections, credit spreads — in intuitive formats that the everyday user can actually navigate to get exposure or hedge,” Ren said. How gold’s surge past $4,350 forecasts Bitcoin price Only time stands between Bitcoin and gold’s price rally. Silicon Valley Bank Venture capitalists in 2026 will deploy more funds into institutional-grade crypto products from established companies, according to Anthony Vassallo and Josh Pherigo, analysts at Silicon Valley Bank. “The suits and ties have arrived,” the pair said. “Corporate adoption of crypto is accelerating confidence on both sides of the market.” Key sectors that will see significant disruption from both crypto and AI include payments, market infrastructure and global commerce, they said. Mergers and acquisitions between fintech and crypto companies will also “post another banner year,” they said. 21 Shares Crypto exchange-traded funds will surpass $400 billion in assets under management in 2026, according to 21Shares. “These vehicles have become strategic allocation tools,” analysts at the crypto ETF issuer wrote. “Besides individual wallet holdings, ETFs and funds represent the largest share of held BTC, reflecting the rise of patient capital.” TRM Labs Crypto will enter a more mature, tightly regulated phase, according to the 2026 outlook report by Blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. Regulators in dozens of jurisdictions are no longer debating whether to oversee digital assets, but how aggressively to do so and on whose terms, according to the company. UK sanctions crypto exchange tied to Russian ruble stablecoin The UK sanctioned a Kyrgyzstan-based bank and crypto exchange on Wednesday, citing their support for A7A5, a stablecoin backed by… Sanctions evasion , illicit finance and state-linked activity are pushing governments to treat blockchain networks as matters of national security, not just financial innovation, the report said. This is likely to result in sharper fragmentation between compliant, institutionally integrated crypto markets and offshore venues operating at the margins.

Bitcoin at 15 cents.Ethereum before DeFi.Validators before the network mattered. QIE is sitting in that same window right now. Not as a copy of what came before — but as a more advanced evolution of it. Earn 10x the passive income returns of boring rental propery with tenants not paying and breaking stuff QIE Is Not “Another Blockchain” Think of QIE as a global decentralized computer. Developers don’t just transact on it — they build on it. Applications live on it. Economic activity flows through it. And every interaction requires QIE to function. Just like electricity powers the grid, QIE powers the network. The difference? QIE is designed from day one to scale, to burn value back into the system, and to reward those who secure it. Real Adoption, Not Promises At QIE’s first developer conference and hackathon, the response wasn’t theoretical: 4,000 teams entered 180 new decentralized applications were created A real, active developer ecosystem formed immediately This is what early traction actually looks like — builders showing up before the hype. QIE has 4 hackathons per annum luring more than 10,000 developers per annum. The Validator Economics (Where the Asymmetry Lives) Every month, 50,000 QIE is distributed to validators. It will be distributed in roughly 100 years. That distribution: Rewards those securing the network Is not inflationary chaos, because 80% of all gas fees are permanently burned And every two years, rewards are halved. Sound familiar? This is a deliberate scarcity model—one that disproportionately rewards early participation. The more QIE you stake, the larger your share of monthly rewards. Simple mechanics. Powerful consequences. Liquidity Is Coming On 6 January 2026, QIE will be listed on MEXC. Integrations to coinsnow, nowpayments, alchemy pay, zapper, changelly etc. are coming in the following months. That matters. It means: Easier access for global buyers and sellers Deeper liquidity Lower friction for developers, validators, and users A clear on-ramp into the ecosystem Liquidity is what turns infrastructure into an economy—easy access to more than 40 onramps across over 150 countries. QIE can already be purchased on XT, Bitmart and QIE wallet. The Market Is Already Noticing QIE didn’t wait for exchange listings to move. Up ~700% during 2025 Up over 200% in the first week of 2026 alone This isn’t a guarantee of the future — but it is a signal of demand meeting limited supply. Validators don’t just earn rewards. They sit at the intersection of cash flow + long-term upside. Becoming a Validator Is Not Complicated You don’t need a data center. You don’t need institutional backing. You need: A reliable VPS (providers like DigitalOcean work perfectly) QIE staked on the network A long-term mindset That’s it. The network does the rest. Why Validators Matter More Than Ever Every decentralized application built on QIE: Pays transaction fees in QIE Contributes to fee burning Increases network usage Strengthens validator economics Validators are not “supporting players”. They are co-owners of the network’s future cash flows. The Time Horizon Advantage Most people look for the next trade. Validators think in 5–10 year windows. If you missed Bitcoin at cents. If you watched Ethereum go from obscure to unavoidable. If you understand that infrastructure compounds quietly before it explodes — Then becoming a QIE validator isn’t speculation. It’s positioning. Final Thought QIE is doing what Bitcoin and Ethereum did — but with better technology, clearer incentives, and lessons already learned. The opportunity is not buying tokens. The opportunity is securing the network that everyone else will eventually need. Documentation, explainer videos, and validator guides are available below. The question isn’t whether decentralized infrastructure wins. It’s whether you were early enough to matter.

Many altcoins have produced even more impressive daily gains. Ripple’s XRP stands out from the larger caps. BTC Stopped at $95K The primary cryptocurrency entered 2026 at around $88,000 after ending last year in the red. Following a rather calm January 1, BTC went on the offensive on the first business day, surging to $90,000. It was stopped there at first, but quickly reclaimed that level and remained above it during most of the weekend, even after the attacks against Venezuela and the capture of its president. Bitcoin climbed again on Monday, this time to and above $92,000. The bulls kept the pressure on as the day progressed and helped bitcoin surge to almost $95,000 on Tuesday morning. This became its highest price tag since mid-November. However, the cryptocurrency was stopped at this point and was pushed south to under $93,000. It found support there, and trades at $93,500 as of press time. Its market capitalization has risen to $1.865 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has taken another hit and is down to 56.8%. BTCUSD Jan 6. Source: TradingView XRP Soars As mentioned above, Ripple’s native token, which recently flipped BNB in terms of market cap, has gained the most value from the larger caps. XRP has surged by almost 10% daily and marked a multi-week peak of its own at $2.40 earlier today, before it was pushed down slightly to $2.35. ETH, BNB, SOL, DOGE, and LINK are also in the green, but in a more modest manner. ADA, XLM, and SHIB have posted more impressive gains, while BCH is among the few altcoins in the red today. Even more gains are evident from RENDER (18%), SUI (16%), and HASH (13.5%). The total crypto market cap has added another $50 billion and is close to $3.3 trillion on CG.

Bitcoin Rebound To $107,000 Next? “Near perfect base for BTCUSD with a Bollinger Band Squeeze and breakout,” Bollinger wrote alongside the chart. “First upside target 100,000, second ~107,000, third ??? If we fail here it is back into the trenches.” On the daily timeframe, BTC spent much of the late-year period carving out a sideways-to-slightly-higher base after the sharp Q4 selloff. The chart explicitly labels that “Base” region, with price repeatedly holding a low-to-mid $80,000s floor area before turning higher. That basing process matters in Bollinger’s framing because it provided the platform for volatility compression to do its work. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Recovery Extends Into 2026 as Charts Hint at Another Leg Higher The squeeze is visible in the Bollinger BandWidth panel at the bottom of the chart, where BandWidth sinks to a marked low (“Squeeze”) and then begins to turn up. That inflection is paired with a sharp surge in the %B panel (the middle indicator pane), where %B drives up through the 1.0 line, an on-chart signal that price has pushed beyond the upper Bollinger Band. Bollinger annotates that moment as the “Breakout,” and the price panel shows the market accelerating higher off the base as the bands begin to open. On Bollinger’s chart, BTC is trading at $94,484, with the upper band curling higher and the mid-band rising beneath price. In plain terms: the move is no longer just compression; it is active expansion. Bollinger’s chart draws two horizontal red targets above current price: the first at $100,000 and the second near $107,000. Related Reading: The Real Reason Bitcoin Is Stuck: Futures Trading Dwarfs ETFs 20-To-1 The risk control is equally clear in his commentary. “If we fail here it is back into the trenches,” he wrote, language that, in chart terms, points to BTC losing the breakout and slipping back into the prior base region which is capped at the $93,500 region. This price level is of utmost importance for Bollinger. What About ETH And XRP? Bollinger also addressed the broader crypto market:“Someone asked about ETHUSD. Same pattern, a bit delayed, following not leading,” he wrote, positioning ether as a lagging participant rather than the driver. For XRP, Bollinger’s take was more cautious despite the obvious lift. “And ripple, strong lift, but the pattern is weaker. BTC > ETH > XRP for now.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,325.

The price sits near $2.34 at press time, with a weekly gain of over 25%. Meanwhile, trading volume is over $8.5 billion, and XRP now has a market cap of $142 billion. It remains the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by value. Price Recovers from Key Support The rally began after the token tested support near the $2 level, an area that held firm throughout last year. Buyers stepped in, and the price quickly climbed, undoing seven weeks of losses. It is now testing the $2.34 to $2.4 zone, with short-term momentum still in place. ChartNerdTA called the move a full recovery, saying it has taken out the “ last 7 weeks of downside PA .” The move has also cleared several technical hurdles, putting $2.5 in focus as the next potential test. If broken, traders may look toward $2.75 as the next level. CryptoWZRD said XRPBTC has been driving the move and sees resistance around $2.27. They added, “A retest of $2.28 with a reversal could offer a long,” while also noting that a failure to hold could lead to range-bound movement. In addition, traders are now watching the $2.41 level. Steph Is Crypto noted that this area represents a “cost-basis wall,” where about 1.56 billion XRP were previously bought. Moves into such zones often face selling from holders looking to exit at break-even. John Bollinger shared a cautious view. He said the XRP chart shows a “ strong lift ” but argued that the pattern remains “ weaker ” than those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He pointed to the lack of tight consolidation before the move, which can make price action less stable. ETF Flows and Supply on Exchanges Spot XRP ETFs in the US posted over $46 million in inflows on Monday. These products have not seen a single day of outflows since their launch in mid-November. The steady inflows reflect demand from institutional buyers. XRP Spot ETF Inflows, Source: SoSoValue At the same time, the exchange supply has been thinning. Fewer tokens available on exchanges may support the price if demand continues. Traders now wait to see if XRP can break and hold above the $2.5 mark or if selling pressure builds near current levels.

Notably, the surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows comes as BTC price action shows renewed strength after weeks of consolidation. This combination of ETF capital inflows and stable market sentiment is reshaping expectations for the Bitcoin price in 2026. Spot Bitcoin ETFs record strongest inflows in months According to Coinglass data , US spot Bitcoin ETFs reported $697.20 million in net inflows on January 5. This marked the largest daily inflow since October and reversed a recent period of muted or negative ETF flows. The inflows were broad-based, with a majority of Bitcoin ETFs seeing huge inflows. Only the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) did not see any significant inflows. Such widespread participation suggests institutional confidence in Bitcoin rather than short-term speculative positioning. BTC institutional demand on the rise Bitcoin ETFs serve as a primary gateway for institutional exposure to BTC. Rising ETF inflows indicate that large investors are increasing allocations through regulated investment vehicles. This type of demand is structurally supportive for the Bitcoin price, as ETF inflows require direct spot BTC purchases. Sustained ETF demand also tends to reduce circulating supply, tightening market conditions over time. Whale accumulation reinforces bullish Bitcoin signals Alongside ETF inflows, on-chain data shows significant Bitcoin accumulation by large holders. The total Bitcoin whale holdings have risen to over $3.11 million from a low of around $3 million on December 12, 2025, suggesting that whales are accumulating the cryptocurrency after a period of offloading. Source: CryptoQuant This accumulation phase has occurred while smaller retail BTC holders reduce exposure . Historically, similar divergences between whale buying and retail selling have preceded upward Bitcoin price moves. Bitcoin price remains resilient amid global uncertainty Furthermore, the Bitcoin price has remained stable despite heightened geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty. On-chain metrics indicate limited panic selling, suggesting that investors are maintaining their long-term conviction. Derivatives data also reflects calm market behaviour rather than excessive leverage or speculative excess. This stability reinforces the idea that the current Bitcoin strength is driven by fundamentals rather than hype. Bitcoin price forecast The ETF inflows have aligned with a technical breakout, with Bitcoin moving above a key consolidation range near $90,000. Such alignment between price action and capital flows often strengthens trend continuation. If Bitcoin ETF inflows remain positive and whale accumulation continues, BTC price could retest resistance near the mid-$90,000 range. A sustained break above this level would open the door toward psychological targets near $100,000. However, any sharp reversal in ETF flows could slow momentum and lead to renewed consolidation. Overall, the combination of Bitcoin ETF demand, institutional accumulation, and calm market conditions suggests a cautiously bullish Bitcoin price outlook in the near term.

As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.35, up more than 9% on the day, lifting its weekly gains to over 25%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, XRP is trading comfortably above its 50-day SMA near $2.03, signaling strong short-term momentum. However, it remains below the 200-day SMA at around $2.45, indicating persistent long-term resistance. However, the 14-day RSI near 75 shows XRP is overbought, suggesting recent gains may be stretched and that a short-term pullback or consolidation is possible. XRP’s price advance drove a sharp rise in market value, lifting its market capitalization to $142.81 billion at press time from $129.74 billion a day earlier, representing an inflow of $13.07 billion. XRP 24-hour market cap chart. Source: CoinMarket The rally saw XRP break through a resistance zone around the $2 mark that had capped upside for weeks, supported by one of the token’s strongest volume surges since mid-December. Impact of ETF on XRP Market participants pointed to heavy institutional participation alongside a tightening supply of tokens held on exchanges, a combination that amplified the move once resistance levels were cleared. Institutional flows were particularly visible in the U.S. spot XRP ETF market. On Monday alone, these products recorded $48 million in inflows, extending a streak of uninterrupted daily inflows since their launch on November 13. Several XRP ETFs also posted their highest single-day trading volumes on record, accelerating the pace of accumulation. Cumulative inflows into spot XRP ETFs have now s urpassed $1 billion in under two months. Since the first product launched in mid-November, the funds have logged eight consecutive weeks of net inflows, reaching approximately $1.23 billion as of Monday. This sustained demand has reinforced bullish sentiment and provided a steady source of buying pressure. At the same time, the token has been supported by broader cryptocurrency market sentiment led by Bitcoin ( BTC ), largely triggered by geopolitical events involving the United States and Venezuela.

The cryptocurrency consolidated between $85,000 and $94,000 while gaining over 3% in the first trading sessions as equities softened. According to Bitfinex analysts , the shift follows a year-end marked by thin liquidity and tax-loss harvesting, which pushed BTC down 6.44% in 2025, even as the S&P 500 closed near record highs with a 16.33% annual gain. Source: Bitfinex Report The pace of ETF-driven selling has also slowed materially heading into year-end, suggesting much of the de-risking may already be priced in. With liquidity conditions expected to improve through early 2026, analysts believe upcoming ETF flow data will prove critical in determining whether fresh institutional capital returns to digital assets or caution continues to dominate positioning. Macro Backdrop Shifts as Yield Curve Steepens Bitfinex analysts assert that two reinforcing trends are shaping US macro conditions: Steepening yield curve. Structurally weaker dollar. The Treasury curve has moved decisively out of the inverted state it held from 2022 to 2024 , driven by expectations of eventual policy easing at the front end. At the same time, long-dated yields remain elevated due to inflation uncertainty, heavy issuance, and fiscal concerns. Source: Bitfinex Report The spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries has widened to approximately 140 basis points, while the two-to-ten-year curve has reached around 70 basis points. Analysts noted this configuration as a repricing of duration and credibility risk rather than renewed growth optimism, keeping financial conditions tighter than headline rate cuts alone would suggest. Meanwhile, the US dollar has weakened meaningfully year to date, declining roughly 9% from January 2025 levels despite a modest rebound toward year-end. Source: Bitfinex Report The depreciation, according to analysts, reflects policy preferences for improved trade competitiveness and a gradual reassessment of US policy credibility following tariff decisions and multilateral withdrawals earlier in the year. Beyond immediate currency dynamics, the report noted that the dollar’s structural foundations remain intact, supported by deep capital markets and sustained demand for Treasuries. The balance of risks points to a managed depreciation rather than a reversal, creating an environment where elevated long-end yields and a softer dollar reward assets with near-term cash flows and defensive characteristics. Corporate and Sovereign Crypto Adoption Advances Corporate treasury-led accumulation remained a dominant theme through year-end. Strategy Inc. reinforced its long-term Bitcoin approach with another early-January purchase , lifting its holdings to 673,783 BTC. BitMine Immersion Technologies also deepened its commitment to Ethereum, growing its holdings to roughly 4.14 million ETH while expanding into staking and validator infrastructure . Analysts particularly noted the company’s shift from passive accumulation toward yield-generating, on-chain strategies, with approximately 408,627 ETH already staked and plans to launch a proprietary validator network in early Q1 2026. Chairman Thomas Lee characterized BitMine as “ a leading source of incremental demand for ETH ,” citing continued accumulation amid year-end selling pressure. The company added more than 32,977 ETH in the most recent week alone as seasonal tax-related dynamics created favorable entry points for long-term buyers. Bitmine Immersion, chaired by Tom Lee, added 32,977 ETH in the past week, lifting its crypto + cash holdings to $14.2B. #Ethereum #Bitmine https://t.co/BZxDjLifGA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 5, 2026 At the sovereign level, Bitfinex analysts also noted Turkmenistan’s introduction of a legal framework permitting domestic crypto mining and trading under central bank oversight, marking a notable policy shift for one of the world’s most closed economies. While the law formalizes licensing and regulatory supervision, it stops short of recognizing cryptocurrencies as legal tender and maintains strict controls on internet access. Analysts See Selective Liquidity Environment Ahead “ While Bitcoin consolidated in a tight range to close 2025, likely weighed down by year-end tax-loss harvesting and portfolio rebalancing, the new year has opened with glimmers of positivity, ” Bitfinex analysts told Cryptonews. “ The US Treasury curve has moved decisively out of the inverted state it experienced from 2022-2024, reflecting a macro environment where liquidity improves selectively. “ The combination of elevated long-end yields and a softer dollar defines an environment that rewards assets with near-term cash flows, pricing power, and real or defensive characteristics, which can significantly benefit Bitcoin. “ As we move into early 2026, upcoming ETF flow data will be the critical signal to confirm whether institutional appetite is truly re-entering the market or if caution still dominates positioning, ” the analysts added.

GBTC’s AUM has slipped to third place among spot Bitcoin ETFs, with lower liquidity and continued outflows despite reduced fee flight in 2025. Bitcoin’s network fundamentals weakened in 2025, with transaction fees down 78% YoY and active addresses and transactions also declining. GBTC will track Bitcoin’s price, but long-term investors pay unnecessary fees versus lower-cost alternatives like IBIT and FBTC. Ten months after I last covered the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) for Seeking Alpha, the GBTC share price is essentially flat. When I wrote that prior GBTC piece, it was actually the first in a series of downgrades that I gave BTC proxies from 'buy' to 'hold.' Down 6% during 2025, Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) was one of the major laggards in the financial markets and trailed nearly every major investment asset class. In this update, we'll look at on-chain data, valuation multiples, and capital flows to assess whether or not it is time to upgrade GBTC back to a 'buy' in 2026. On-Chain Data and Valuation Multiples There are several Bitcoin 'analysts' on platforms like X who would argue that on-chain network data is irrelevant to Bitcoin's bull case. My argument for years has been that over shorter-term time frames, it is likely true that on-chain usage doesn't matter as much as other factors. However, over multi-year time frames, my view is that fundamentals will ultimately matter for Bitcoin. One of my key criticisms of Bitcoin has been the eroding security model that has seen a total collapse in fees paid to miners. Quarterly Averages Q4-25 Q3-25 Q4-25 YoY MoM DAAs (000s) 514.9 487.3 472.6 -8.2% -3.0% Transactions (millions) 49.4 42.3 41.6 -15.8% -1.7% Fees (millions) $125.5 $43.3 $27.6 -78.0% -36.3% Avg Tx Fee $2.62 $1.06 $0.68 -74.0% -35.8% Source: Token Terminal While I've typically looked at these numbers through monthly averages, since we're at the beginning of a new year, I thought it would be beneficial to instead look at quarterly averages for this report. Here we can see that Daily Active Addresses (DAAs) were down 8% year over year, transactions were down by 16% YoY, and fees from transactions were down a staggering 78% from Q4-24. While fees are not a significant portion of miner rewards today, they will be down the line due to Bitcoin's four-year halving events. The latter of which sees reduced token issuance paid out in return for the high levels of compute capex and energy spending required to secure a blockchain ledger that fewer people are using as each year goes by. I think this is really put into perspective when viewed through a circulating price-to-fees multiple: Bitcoin P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) Judging by this metric, Bitcoin is more expensive than it has ever been in its history relative to network fees, per data from Token Terminal. This Capital Flows and Peer Funds Since the year-to-date capital flow story offers less than a week of data, we'll instead look at full-year numbers for 2025 and how they compare with 2024. Total digital asset market investment flows were slightly negative by 3.3% during the full year 2025. Interestingly, this was driven almost entirely by a 35% year-over-year decline in Bitcoin investment flows from $41.7 billion in 2024 down to $27 billion in 2025: Asset (mil) 2025 2024 YoY Change Bitcoin $26,984 $41,690 -35.3% Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) $12,698 $5,335 138.0% Multi-asset -$214.0 $295.0 -172.5% Ripple USD ( XRP-USD ) $3,697.0 $608.0 508.1% Solana USD ( SOL-USD ) $3,562.0 $310.0 1049.0% Total $47,152 $48,740 -3.3% BTC Dominance 57.2% 85.5% -33.1% Source: CoinShares To be sure, Bitcoin was still the dominant recipient of capital flows last year with a commanding 57% share of total flows. However, that too was down from over 85% in 2024. None of this should really be all that unexpected, from where I sit. With the emergence of more US-listed spot ETFs last year and the growing interest in DAT strategies centered around altcoins, the natural progression of digital asset capital flow is into a broader mix of assets rather than just one or two. And yet, the multi-asset products saw outflow rather than inflows in 2025. My read on that is more an indication of poor ""diversified"" product construction rather than indifference to digital asset diversification as a concept. ETFs and other funds were just the second-largest source of BTC acquisition last year: Holding Entities 12/31/2024 12/31/2025 Change % Private Companies 271,742 288,302 16,560 6.1% Governments 513,725 647,021 133,296 25.9% DeFi/Smart Contracts 169,186 376,812 207,626 122.7% ETFS/Funds 1,287,054 1,488,932 201,878 15.7% Public Companies 598,714 1,093,648 494,934 82.7% Total Holdings 2,840,421 3,894,715 1,054,294 37.1% BTC/USD $93,595 $88,398 -$5,197 -5.6% Source: BitcoinTreasuries Of the known holding entities, the biggest category for BTC growth by nominal change was public companies at 495k BTC. Though it should be mentioned that 97.6% of public company BTC holdings growth came from a single entity. Looking at the breakout by ETF issuer, it's very clear that iShares was again the winner in 2025 among the four major holders of digital assets through ETF products: Provider (millions) YTD Flows AUM 2025 Flows 2024 Flows iShares $336 $81,419 $35,056 $40,795 Grayscale $131 $26,198 -$2,851 -$18,882 Fidelity $99 $22,001 $2,151 $11,864 Bitwise $55 $7,772 $1,105 $2,601 Total $621 $137,390 $35,461 $36,378 Source: CoinShares Grayscale still owns the number 2 spot behind iShares in terms of AUM. However, I suspect that Fidelity could overtake Grayscale in total AUM by the end of 2026, given what we've seen over the last two years. Fidelity has already taken over the number 2 spot in the spot Bitcoin ETF race. While Grayscale's outflow problem was much smaller in 2025 than it was in 2024, the company is clearly still dealing with a 'fee flight' problem due to its higher management fees on its legacy products. Fund Name Inception Expense Ratio AUM Avg Vol/AUM Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF 09/25/2013 1.50% $14.78B 2.7% iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) 01/05/2024 0.25% $69.23B 4.7% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) 01/10/2024 0.25% $18.12B 2.9% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 01/10/2024 0.20% $3.46B 4.1% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) 01/10/2024 0.21% $3.39B 4.4% Source: Seeking Alpha, as of 1/5/26 At a 1.5% expense ratio, GBTC is still far away from the rest of the market from a management fee standpoint. When the fund was converted to a spot ETF back in 2024, it was the largest fund in the table above by AUM. Presently, it is down to the third-ranked fund after IBIT and FBTC. Finally, at just 2.7% average volume to AUM trading on a daily basis, GBTC is less liquid than the other funds with the top 5 spot BTC AUM. Closing Summary While the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF will work fine for investors who want simple exposure to Bitcoin, I don't think it's the best fund in the category due to the enormous fee relative to peers. As a trading vehicle, GBTC still has decent liquidity but again falls short relative to peers. All this said, for a simple, straightforward Bitcoin play, GBTC will pace with Bitcoin. However, long-term investors will continue to pay more than they need to by buying GBTC over alternatives. Whether or not Bitcoin rebounds in 2026, GBTC is a fund that I'd personally avoid. Grayscale's mini trust is a perfectly fine low-fee alternative to GBTC.",BTC-USD|GBTC,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Is the next down leg underway, or could this be a short pause before breaking higher? $94,000 resistance: rejection or further upside? Source: TradingView The last thrust by the Bitcoin bulls just managed to post a higher high, even if it was by the slimmest of margins. It now remains to be seen if the $BTC price will start to reverse now and return to retest the $90,000, or even the $88,000 horizontal supports. As can be noted in the Stochastic RSI, the indicator lines have dipped very quickly. This could mean that a potential reversal may not come down too far. The short trendline the price is currently following may not hold for long. Therefore once the price comes down through, it could either stop at the $90,400, or the $88,000 horizontal support levels. The rising lower trendline of the bear flag could be another target. The longer the price takes to meander down and sideways, the more time there will be for the shorter term Stochastic RSIs to reset. This could potentially result in more upside momentum once the price turns back around again. Is there a chance that the $BTC price could continue to go up from here and definitively break the $94,000 resistance? Yes, this is a possibility. If this resistance is broken and confirmed above, the route to $100,000 looks relatively straight forward. That said, with the bear flag top also around this level, a strong rejection would be probable. Retest of an ascending triangle? Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it can be observed that a potential ascending triangle could be forming. If the $BTC price comes back to the bottom of the triangle and rises again, on the balance of probabilities it could then break out, with a measured move to $108,700. This would also nullify the bear flag. This next move down will be watched with eager anticipation. The bottom of the triangle is also likely to be bolstered by the major ascending trendline, and the $90,000 horizontal support level. A bounce would seem likely. Measured move to key structural level Source: TradingView Zooming further out into the weekly time frame one’s eyes are drawn to the target of the measured move out of the ascending triangle. This is pretty much to the $108,000 horizontal resistance, which also happens to be a major price structure line, with the top of the previous falling wedge holding it as resistance, and with a decent part of the current falling wedge holding it as support. If the ascending triangle thesis plays out, the price would be knocking on the door of the last big structural level before the all-time high. If the $BTC price was rejected from there, this would have been nothing more than a bear market rally. However, if the price was able to break through, a retest of the 8-year trendline would be beckoning. One note of caution: it’s never a good thing to get too far ahead of oneself in trading, and a good dose of pragmatism is always needed. Be ready to change your view if the chart moves against you.

The copper-to-gold ratio’s persistent climb presents a compelling bullish signal for the flagship cryptocurrency, according to recent market analysis. This development suggests a significant shift in global risk appetite that historically precedes major Bitcoin price movements. Consequently, institutional and retail traders alike scrutinize this relationship for clues about the next market cycle. Understanding the Copper-Gold Ratio Signal for Bitcoin The copper-gold ratio measures the price of copper per ounce divided by the price of gold per ounce. Market analysts traditionally view this metric as a barometer for global economic sentiment. Copper, often called “Dr. Copper” for its diagnostic ability, sees demand surge during industrial expansion and infrastructure projects. Conversely, gold serves as a classic safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty or inflationary periods. Therefore, a rising ratio typically indicates a “risk-on” environment where investors favor growth-oriented assets. A declining ratio signals a “risk-off” shift toward defensive holdings. Bitcoin’s correlation with this ratio stems from its dual nature as both a risk asset and an inflation hedge. Recent data from trading platforms and macroeconomic reports shows the ratio climbing steadily since late 2024. Historical Correlation Between Commodity Ratios and Crypto Markets Historical analysis reveals striking parallels between Bitcoin’s price peaks and copper-gold ratio highs. During the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin’s surge to nearly $20,000 coincided with a significant ratio peak. Similarly, the 2021 market cycle saw Bitcoin approach $69,000 as the ratio reached multi-year highs. These patterns suggest Bitcoin often rallies when economic optimism fuels industrial metal demand. Furthermore, past bull markets frequently began as the ratio reversed from a prolonged downtrend. This pattern occurred in early 2019 and again in late 2020. The current ratio trajectory mirrors these historical reversals, according to data from financial analytics firms. Market historians note that while correlation doesn’t guarantee causation, the statistical relationship remains significant across multiple cycles. Expert Analysis on Macroeconomic Indicators Financial strategists emphasize the importance of context when interpreting these signals. “The ratio alone doesn’t dictate Bitcoin’s price,” explains Dr. Lena Chen, a macroeconomic researcher at Stanford University. “However, it reflects the underlying economic conditions that enable crypto asset appreciation. A rising ratio suggests expanding industrial production, which often correlates with increased liquidity and investor confidence—key ingredients for crypto bull markets.” Chen’s research, published in the Journal of Alternative Investments, tracks 15 years of commodity-crypto relationships. Her team identified three distinct phases where copper-gold movements preceded Bitcoin trends by 3-6 months. This lag allows observant investors to position themselves accordingly, though she cautions against relying on any single indicator. Current Market Dynamics and Copper Price Drivers The recent copper surge stems from multiple converging factors. Global manufacturing indices show expansion across major economies, particularly in renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle production. Both sectors consume substantial copper for wiring, motors, and charging systems. Additionally, supply constraints at major South American mines have tightened global inventories since 2023. Simultaneously, gold prices have stabilized despite persistent inflation concerns. Central bank policies in 2024 and early 2025 have moderated aggressive rate hikes, reducing gold’s urgency as an inflation hedge. This combination—strong copper demand with stable gold—pushes the ratio higher. Bitcoin typically thrives in such environments where growth expectations outweigh fear, according to trading volume data from major exchanges. Bitcoin’s Evolving Role in Portfolio Strategy Bitcoin’s response to these macroeconomic signals demonstrates its maturation as an asset class. Initially dismissed as purely speculative, Bitcoin now shows sensitivity to traditional financial indicators. Portfolio managers increasingly treat Bitcoin as a hybrid asset—part growth technology, part monetary hedge. This dual characteristic explains its positive reaction to rising copper-gold ratios. Several key developments support this evolution: Institutional Adoption: Major asset managers now offer Bitcoin ETFs, integrating crypto into traditional portfolios. Regulatory Clarity: Improved frameworks in key markets reduce uncertainty for institutional investors. Infrastructure Maturity: Robust custody solutions and trading platforms mirror traditional finance standards. Macro Sensitivity: Bitcoin now reacts predictably to interest rate expectations and liquidity measures. This maturation means Bitcoin increasingly moves with, not against, certain traditional indicators. The copper-gold ratio represents one of the clearest examples of this convergence. Risk Factors and Counterarguments Despite the compelling correlation, analysts identify several important caveats. Geopolitical tensions could disrupt industrial supply chains, depressing copper demand independently of broader economic health. Additionally, unexpected inflation spikes might boost gold disproportionately, distorting the ratio’s signal. Bitcoin also faces unique challenges including regulatory developments and technological shifts that commodity ratios cannot capture. Historical data shows the relationship isn’t perfect. During the 2022 market downturn, the copper-gold ratio declined while Bitcoin fell more sharply. This divergence suggests Bitcoin remains more volatile than traditional risk assets. Investors should therefore use the ratio as one tool among many, not as a standalone predictor. Conclusion The rising copper-gold ratio provides a significant bullish signal for Bitcoin as we progress through 2025. This relationship reflects Bitcoin’s growing integration with traditional macroeconomic indicators. Historical patterns suggest favorable conditions for cryptocurrency appreciation when industrial optimism outpaces defensive positioning. However, prudent investors will monitor additional factors including regulatory developments, adoption metrics, and technological advancements. The copper-gold ratio offers valuable context, but Bitcoin’s ultimate trajectory will depend on multiple converging variables in the evolving digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the copper-gold ratio? The copper-gold ratio divides the price per ounce of copper by the price per ounce of gold. Traders use this metric to gauge market sentiment, with higher ratios indicating economic optimism and lower ratios suggesting risk aversion. Q2: How strong is the historical correlation with Bitcoin? Statistical analysis shows moderate to strong correlation during specific market cycles, particularly around major Bitcoin price peaks. However, the relationship isn’t perfect and should be considered alongside other indicators. Q3: Why would industrial metal prices affect Bitcoin? Bitcoin responds to similar macroeconomic forces as other risk assets. Strong industrial demand suggests economic growth, increased liquidity, and investor confidence—conditions that historically support Bitcoin appreciation. Q4: Could this signal be wrong for the 2025 market? All market indicators carry uncertainty. Unique factors like cryptocurrency-specific regulation, adoption rates, or technological developments could override traditional macroeconomic signals in this cycle. Q5: How should investors use this information? Investors might consider the copper-gold ratio as one component of a broader analysis. Combining this macroeconomic perspective with cryptocurrency-specific metrics creates a more complete investment framework for 2025 and beyond.

CLSK’s earnings and valuation are heavily tied to Bitcoin prices, but the stock appears to have found technical support. Management aims to pivot CLSK into a broader digital infrastructure platform, targeting stable, high-margin AI data center revenues. CLSK remains high-risk due to Bitcoin volatility; call options are suggested to limit downside while retaining upside potential. Is now the time to bet on CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) stock? There are three reasons why the answer to that question may be ""Yes."" First, CleanSpark is a profitable Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) mining company trading at a relatively low multiple. Second, the stock has pulled back and may have found support at a ""higher low"" level, and BTC may have found support as well. Third, it plans to become a digital infrastructure platform in the next couple of years instead of just a Bitcoin miner, which can provide upside. I rate CLSK as a Buy, but I will admit that it's a cautious Buy. By no means is this a high-conviction play, and I believe owning options may be better than owning shares (to limit downside if the bet is wrong). A Profitable Bitcoin Miner At the moment, CleanSpark still generates 100% of its revenues from Bitcoin mining, which may not excite everyone. But the good news is that this Bitcoin mining revenue has been growing quickly, going from $168.12 million in Fiscal 2023 to $766.31 million in Fiscal 2025. CleanSpark's Revenue 2023-2025 (CLSK's 2025 Earnings Report) More importantly, the company generated a healthy profit in Fiscal 2025. Its income from operations was $318.95 million, adjusted EBITDA was $823.4 million, and its total net income was around $352.9 million. Compared to its market cap of $2.95 billion, that's quite a bit of income. Per its Fiscal 2025 investor presentation , the company has a marginal cost per Bitcoin of $42,956, giving it plenty of room to be profitable now, with the Bitcoin price at around $90,000 despite a fall in recent months. But What About Its Negative Cash Flows? Some may look at CLSK's negative $461 million in cash from operations and conclude that the company just burns money, but that would be an incomplete analysis. CleanSpark isn't a traditional company that can be analyzed that way. The reason for the negative cash flow is largely because its Bitcoin mining revenue gets subtracted from the cash flow statement, as you can see below. That's because getting paid in Bitcoin isn't the same as getting paid in cash. But in reality, Bitcoin can be turned into cash if the company sells it, so the negative cash flow isn't as alarming as it might be at first glance. CleanSpark's Cash Flow From Operating Activities Statement (CLSK's 2025 Earnings Report) And the company does sell Bitcoin to fund its operations. This isn't just theory. During the earnings call, CFO & President Gary Vecchiarelli stated, ""Our focus is on building a capital stack, which minimizes dilution. This starts with the sale of monthly Bitcoin production to cover our monthly OpEx."" The 10-K filing for Fiscal 2025 also states, ""The Company generated $378,158 of cash flows from the sales of Bitcoin and settlement of Bitcoin-linked derivatives during the year ended September 30, 2025."" You can see that figure highlighted below (in thousands, so it's $378.158 million). You'll also see that the company received $41.662 million from the sale of miners and $9.653 million from the sale of derivative contracts. CleanSpark's Cash Flow From Investing Activities Fiscal 2025 (CLSK's 2025 Earnings Report) Apart from funding itself via Bitcoin sales, CleanSpark has also raised money through a rising share count and debt issuances. Below, you can see that CleanSpark's share count has risen significantly over the years, although it has fallen to 255.6 million recently due to a $460 million share buyback that it funded through a $1.15 billion convertible note offering. CLSK's Share Count Over Time (FinBox) The company still has a significant amount of money remaining from the offering, and the good news is that the interest rate on the convertible notes is 0%, so it doesn't put strain on CleanSpark in terms of interest payments. In other words, the company has several levers it can pull to stay afloat despite the negative cash flow figure on the surface. Nonetheless, selling BTC is a big way the company funds itself, and that introduces the BTC risk, of course. CleanSpark won't be able to fund itself as greatly during times when BTC's price is depressed. The Valuation Looks Relatively Low Based on Fiscal 2025's earnings, the stock trades at 8.4x earnings. Now, I'm not going to pretend that I can reasonably project where its earnings will end up next year, as that's a really hard task for this type of company, especially since earnings are directly tied to BTC's performance. However, we can still look at analysts' EPS estimates for reference. Despite analysts expecting a decline in EPS to $0.87 for September 2026, that still suggests a relatively low forward P/E of 13.3x, using the current share price of $11.55. Meanwhile, Fiscal 2027's EPS estimate of $1.17 leads to a forward P/E of 9.9x. EPS Estimates For CLSK (Seeking Alpha) That's attractive compared to peers. For example, Riot Platforms, Inc.'s ( RIOT ) estimated EPS for 2026 is -$0.52 , so it's not even expected to make a profit. Similarly, MARA Holdings, Inc.'s ( MARA ) expected EPS for 2026 is -$0.18 before rising to $0.67 in Fiscal 2027 for a forward P/E near 15x, but that's still higher than the estimated multiple for CLSK. Meanwhile, Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) is profitable, but its forward P/E for 2026 is 33x . We can also look at its forward price/sales ratio of 2.98x, which is lower than its three-year mean of 3.85x, signaling a relatively low valuation. CLSK's Historical NTM Price/Sales Multiple (TIKR.com) Now, CleanSpark is only cheap if you think Bitcoin won't crash. Its earnings and earnings/revenue estimates will be heavily influenced by the price of Bitcoin. For example, in mid-August, the revenue estimate for Fiscal 2026 was $1.17 billion. That's when the price of Bitcoin was closer to $117,000. By November 27, this estimate fell to $876.5 million. That's a huge drop, and it's because Bitcoin's price was around $91,000 by then. Revenue Revisions For CleanSpark (Seeking Alpha) Meanwhile, in August, the EPS estimate for Fiscal 2026 was $1.40. The estimate for that same period is now $0.87. That goes to show just how sensitive the company's earnings (and earnings estimates) can be to the price of Bitcoin. Of course, there are other factors that influence these estimates, but the price of BTC is certainly a major one. CLSK's EPS Revision History (Seeking Alpha) The current estimates should be used as a proxy based on BTC's current price. CLSK looks cheap if BTC holds at current levels or goes higher. If it falls meaningfully from here, that $0.87 EPS estimate suddenly will look distant. Remember that if BTC falls below CLSK's marginal cost per Bitcoin of $42,956, then it won't be able to generate even a gross profit. On the other hand, it's reasonable to assume that 2026 EPS estimates can be over $1 again if we make it back to $120,000 for BTC. Now, let's check out the technical situation. But Bitcoin And CleanSpark May Bounce From Here I believe that both Bitcoin and CleanSpark are likely to bounce from here just by looking at their charts. Let's take a look at Bitcoin's chart first. I generally don't do any complex chart analysis, but I think simplicity works here. I recognize that BTC is still in an uptrend and has pulled back. The pullback seems to have stabilized (see the weekly candlestick chart below), meaning BTC can bounce. Some areas it can rebound to are the $98,700 area, where there was recent support (that support has been broken, but in technical analysis, past support often becomes future resistance, so I believe it's reasonable to expect resistance around there), and the $108,700 area, which also showed support during the summer and has even acted as a resistance earlier. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether a failed bounce will turn into a head & shoulders pattern, since we currently have the first shoulder and the head already formed, so that's something to keep an eye on. BTC-USD Chart (TradingView) If BTC bounces, CLSK stock should bounce too. And CLSK's stock chart looks constructive as well. Recently, it has been making higher lows, as shown with the black arrows I drew in the chart below. The most recent weekly candlestick is a classic hammer candle that can signal a reversal, especially if it's near a support and happens on a pullback. I'm looking for a bounce to the $15-15.50 area, and if that resistance is broken, then the stock can look to test the $22-23 area. CLSK Stock Chart (TradingView) Shift To Digital Infrastructure Platform Provides Upside Potential As mentioned earlier, CleanSpark intends to shift to a digital infrastructure platform rather than relying solely on Bitcoin mining revenues. Specifically, the company's CEO & Chairman, S. Schultz, said the following during the most recent earnings call: We've also set a strategic direction for CleanSpark going forward as a digital infrastructure platform serving a wide range of compute opportunities. These opportunities include, but are not limited to, generative AI workloads, grid balancing through Bitcoin mining, and high-performance computing broadly. This is a positive for sure, as access to reliable energy is extremely important for hyperscalers, and CleanSpark can provide it. Further, the company's President & CFO, Gary Vecchiarelli, noted during the earnings call that the ""AI data center business comes with stable cash flows and high margins, both of which will help CleanSpark through the peaks and valleys of Bitcoin mining economics."" As of now, the company doesn't generate revenue from these ambitions, but this could become a meaningful part of the business in the next few years, providing upside potential. This is especially true since management has already made moves toward these initiatives. For example, in October, it was announced that CleanSpark "" acquired the rights to approximately 271 acres of land in Austin County, Texas, and executed long-term power supply agreements totaling 285 megawatts."" Management expects this power and land in Texas to be used primarily for AI data centers, with the first 200+ megawatts expected to come online in the first half of 2027. CleanSpark mentioned that it will use the remainder of its convertible offering proceeds ($1.15 billion minus $460M used on the buyback minus $200 million used to pay back credit lines) to ""hunt"" for power and land. The company's Fiscal 2025 CapEx was $144.7 million, and I expect this number to be higher for 2026, as management stated that it costs about $1 million to build 1 megawatt of mining infrastructure but about $10 million to do the same for AI and HPC infrastructure. The Risks The main risk here is the volatile nature of the stock and Bitcoin. Since 100% of the company's revenues come from Bitcoin mining so far, the price of Bitcoin will largely determine the trajectory of the stock. Put simply, don't buy this stock if you're not bullish on BTC or if you can't handle potentially large drawdowns. Until the company diversifies out of Bitcoin mining revenues, this is the way it will be. And that's another risk: we don't know how well it'll diversify out of Bitcoin mining and how long it will truly take. The Bottom Line On CLSK Stock CleanSpark is an interesting stock that looks to be sitting closer to a support level than a resistance level, following a recent decline. Given that this is a high-growth, profitable Bitcoin mining company at a relatively low valuation, with an attractive stock chart, I think it's worth speculating on. The upside potential from its digital infrastructure platform pivot is another reason to be optimistic. CLSK stock is risky due to its volatility, but I believe investors can consider buying call options to reduce absolute risk, as they can provide lots of upside potential while not requiring as much capital upfront.",CLSK,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

United States remains the dominant Bitcoin ATM market The United States continued to host the vast majority of the world’s Bitcoin ATMs. Over the course of 2025, the number of U.S.-based machines increased from 30,119 to 30,617, adding 498 ATMs. That represents a 1.65% annual increase, or roughly 1.4 new Bitcoin ATMs per day on average in the U.S. Although growth slowed relative to earlier years, the U.S. still accounted for the majority of global installations, underscoring its role as the primary hub for retail-facing crypto infrastructure. Australia records the fastest growth among major regions Among major regions, Australia recorded the fastest expansion. Bitcoin ATMs in the country rose from 1,385 to 1,986, adding 601 machines, equivalent to a 43% increase in 2025. Canada also posted solid growth, with installations rising from 3,376 to 3,660, a gain of 284 ATMs, or about 8.4% year over year. Europe added 108 machines, bringing its total to 1,760, reflecting a more modest 6.5% increase. While Europe’s growth lagged behind other regions in absolute terms, the increase suggests ongoing infrastructure buildout despite a more fragmented regulatory landscape. Crypto ATM growth slows compared with 2024 The pace of expansion moderated compared with 2024. Finbold reported that in 2024 the global Bitcoin ATM network grew by 2,217 machines, averaging around six new ATMs installed per day worldwide and a 6.0% annual increase. By contrast, 2025’s growth was slower in absolute and percentage terms, signaling a transition from aggressive expansion to more selective deployment as the market matures. The global increase in Bitcoin ATMs during 2025 comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market has increasingly shifted toward regulated digital platforms and institutional products. However, the continued rollout of physical machines suggests that demand for cash-based and in-person access to Bitcoin remains resilient.

This pivotal filing, first reported by Unfolded, represents one of the most significant endorsements of cryptocurrency by a traditional Wall Street titan to date. Consequently, the action signals a potential watershed moment for digital asset integration into mainstream portfolios. The filing arrives amidst a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and growing demand from accredited and institutional investors for regulated exposure to Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust Filing Details and Structure The submitted S-1 form initiates the regulatory process for the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust. This proposed financial product aims to provide investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance without the complexities of direct custody. Importantly, the trust would hold actual Bitcoin, differentiating it from futures-based products. The filing outlines the trust’s operational framework, including custody solutions, fee structures, and risk disclosures mandated by the SEC. Morgan Stanley’s entry follows a series of similar applications from other major asset managers, yet its stature as a premier wealth management firm carries distinct weight. The bank manages trillions in client assets, granting it unparalleled access to high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Historically, Morgan Stanley has demonstrated a measured approach to crypto. For instance, the firm began offering Bitcoin fund access to wealthy clients in 2021. Furthermore, its research division has published extensive analysis on blockchain technology. Therefore, this filing represents a logical and substantial progression of its digital asset strategy. The proposed trust structure must now navigate the SEC’s review process, which scrutinizes market manipulation concerns, custody safeguards, and investor protection mechanisms. Industry observers note that the application’s depth and the filer’s credibility could influence the regulatory dialogue positively. Regulatory Context and the SEC Approval Pathway The SEC’s stance on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products has evolved significantly. After years of rejections citing market surveillance issues, the Commission approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. This created a precedent and a regulatory template. Now, new filings like Morgan Stanley’s are judged against established criteria. Key approval factors include a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size. Additionally, the SEC mandates robust custody arrangements with qualified custodians. Many experts believe the approval of earlier products has paved a clearer, though still rigorous, path for subsequent applicants. A comparative timeline illustrates this shift: Period Regulatory Stance Key Event 2013-2020 Dismissive / Rejective Multiple ETF applications denied 2021-2023 Gradual Engagement Futures-based Bitcoin ETFs approved January 2024 Landmark Approval First spot Bitcoin ETFs approved 2025 Onward Institutional Integration Major bank filings (e.g., Morgan Stanley) This evolving context is crucial. The current SEC leadership under Chair Gary Gensler continues to emphasize full compliance with securities laws. However, the operational success and lack of major issues with the existing spot ETFs have built regulatory confidence. Consequently, filings from entities with sterling compliance records receive serious consideration. The process involves multiple rounds of comments and amendments before a potential effective date is granted. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Precedent Financial analysts highlight several immediate and long-term implications. Firstly, approval would grant Morgan Stanley’s vast client network seamless access to Bitcoin through their existing brokerage accounts. This eliminates technical barriers and integrates crypto into traditional asset allocation models. Secondly, it confers a layer of institutional legitimacy that can alter the perception of Bitcoin among conservative investors. “The filing itself is a powerful signal,” notes a veteran financial strategist at a competing firm. “It tells the market that a blue-chip institution sees sufficient demand, regulatory clarity, and long-term viability to commit significant resources.” The potential market impact is multifaceted: Capital Inflows: It could unlock a new wave of institutional capital previously waiting on the sidelines for trusted custodial vehicles. Price Stability: Increased institutional participation may reduce Bitcoin’s notorious volatility over time. Competitive Pressure: Other global banks and wealth managers may accelerate their own product development to retain clients. Regulatory Scrutiny: Success attracts more regulatory attention, potentially leading to clearer, more standardized rules. Evidence from the 2024 ETF launches supports this analysis. Those products collectively gathered tens of billions in assets within months, demonstrating pent-up demand. A Morgan Stanley trust would tap into a distinct, advice-driven client segment rather than the self-directed traders who dominated early flows. This segment often requires the endorsement of a trusted brand like Morgan Stanley before allocating capital. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency and Traditional Finance The convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) accelerates with each major institutional entry. Morgan Stanley’s filing is a cornerstone in this merging landscape. It reflects a broader trend where banks are not just facilitating crypto trades but are creating and managing the core investment products. This development pushes digital assets further into the realm of regulated securities. As a result, the entire ecosystem matures, focusing more on infrastructure, risk management, and compliance. For the average investor, the practical effects are significant. Access becomes simpler, safer, and more familiar. Fees may become more competitive as large-scale operations achieve economies of scale. Furthermore, financial advisors can now construct portfolios with a crypto component using tools and reporting consistent with other assets. This normalization is perhaps the most profound outcome. Bitcoin transitions from an alternative, speculative asset to a potential mainstream portfolio diversifier, akin to gold or other real assets. The journey, however, remains contingent on regulatory green lights and sustained institutional commitment. Conclusion Morgan Stanley’s filing for a Bitcoin Trust marks a definitive step in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. The move, rooted in client demand and a maturing regulatory environment, highlights the enduring integration of digital assets into global finance. While SEC approval is not guaranteed, the filing itself validates Bitcoin’s position as a serious asset class. The proposed Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust could serve as a critical bridge, connecting the legacy financial world with the innovative potential of blockchain-based assets. Its progression through the regulatory process will be a key indicator of both market readiness and official acceptance in 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What is an S-1 filing with the SEC? An S-1 is the initial registration form required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for companies seeking to offer new securities to the public. It contains essential details about the business, risks, and financial structure of the proposed offering. Q2: How is a Bitcoin Trust different from a Bitcoin ETF? While both provide exposure to Bitcoin’s price, a Trust is typically a closed-end fund that issues a fixed number of shares traded on an exchange, often at a premium or discount to its net asset value. An ETF is an open-ended fund that creates and redeems shares to track the asset’s price more closely. The Morgan Stanley filing is for a Trust structure. Q3: When could the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust be approved and launch? The SEC review process has no fixed timeline. It can take several months, involving multiple rounds of questions and amendments. Based on recent history for similar products, a potential launch window could be in the latter half of 2025, but this is speculative and depends entirely on the regulator’s pace. Q4: Who would be eligible to invest in this Trust? Once approved and launched, the Trust shares would trade on a national exchange. This would make them accessible to any investor with a brokerage account, similar to buying a stock or ETF. Morgan Stanley would likely also offer it directly to its wealth management clients. Q5: What are the main risks associated with a Bitcoin Trust? Key risks include Bitcoin’s high price volatility, potential regulatory changes, cybersecurity threats to custodians, the technological nature of the underlying asset, and the possibility that the trust’s shares trade at a significant premium or discount to the actual Bitcoin held.

The company, known for holding one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries, has become a favorite among investors seeking BTC exposure through equities. Metaplanet gains as Bitcoin climbs Metaplanet’s stock has jumped approximately 8.9% today, coinciding with the rising Bitcoin price , which has recovered significantly since the start of 2026. Investors view Metaplanet as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, treating its shares as a way to participate in BTC gains without holding the cryptocurrency directly. The company currently holds over 35,000 BTC, one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries among public corporations. Metaplanet stock closed the day at around ¥510 , reflecting a significant increase from prior levels. Its 52-week range has been wide, spanning from ¥291 to nearly ¥1,930, highlighting the stock’s volatility and sensitivity to Bitcoin price movements. Average trading volumes have also surged as more investors react to both Bitcoin rallies and corporate announcements. Metaplanet’s strategic moves drive investor confidence Metaplanet recently announced a ¥150 billion share buyback plan . This buyback is seen as a move to enhance capital efficiency and support the stock amid rising Bitcoin prices. Investors responded positively, interpreting the buyback as a signal of confidence in the company’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company’s Bitcoin treasury is growing steadily, with recent reports confirming additional BTC purchases in the last quarter of 2025.

This strategy allows the company to expand its BTC holdings while maintaining operational flexibility. Its stock’s correlation with Bitcoin has made it a bellwether for crypto-linked equities. Other Bitcoin treasury stocks have also benefited from the ongoing crypto rally, reinforcing sector-wide momentum. Bitcoin treasury stocks As Bitcoin prices continue to recover, other Bitcoin treasury stocks like Strive (ASST), Strategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Coinbase Global (COIN), among others, have also seen significant gains. At press time, for instance, the Strive stock was up 19% today, significantly higher than Metaplanet. Investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) without directly holding the asset are increasingly turning to these corporate BTC proxies. With Bitcoin price rising back towards $100,000, companies holding substantial BTC reserves could see increased investor interest, especially since their stock prices seem to correlate with the Bitcoin price movements. This trend is expected to continue, at least for the first quarter of 2026, seeing that the crypto market has started the year on a very high note. With a robust BTC treasury and proactive capital strategies, Metaplanet remains at the forefront of the emerging Bitcoin equity market.

Breaking it could fuel continued upward momentum. A sell wall forms when massive sell orders cluster at a specific price, creating resistance that can halt or reverse a rally. Bitcoin’s surge toward $95K now faces such a wall, signaling whales are ready to offload large BTC positions, potentially testing both retail and institutional demand. Bitcoin faces a $24M sell wall near $95K, one of its largest recent resistances. Breaking it could ignite a sharp rally as buying momentum accelerates, while rejection may trigger a pullback or consolidation. Currently, Bitcoin trades around $93K per CoinCodex data . CW highlights the significance of the $95K sell wall, positioned on Coinbase and Binance, where top whales can heavily influence price and sentiment. Its placement suggests these whales may be testing demand or protecting profits. Monitoring order books and trading volume is crucial, a high-volume breakout above $95K could signal strong market confidence and push Bitcoin toward new highs, while a rejection may trigger short-term volatility and caution. Bitcoin faces a pivotal test at the $95K sell wall, where $24M in whale orders on Coinbase and Binance could dictate its next move. A breakout may trigger strong bullish momentum, while failure could spark short-term pullbacks. Monitoring whale activity remains crucial for navigating crypto’s volatile terrain amid retail giant Walmart recently embracing BTC payments. Conclusion Bitcoin’s $95K sell wall, backed by $24 million in whale orders, is a crucial test of market sentiment. A breakout could spark strong bullish momentum, drawing both retail and institutional buyers, while a rejection may trigger short-term volatility and consolidation. Therefore, this pivotal level should be given a watchful eye because it has the potential to shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks ahead.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

According to comprehensive reporting from DL News, six distinct factors converged to create ideal conditions for Bitcoin’s impressive rally. This analysis explores each element in detail, providing context about market mechanics, institutional behavior, and macroeconomic influences that shaped this pivotal moment in digital asset history. Understanding the Bitcoin Rally: A Multi-Factor Phenomenon The recent Bitcoin rally represents more than simple price appreciation. Market data from March 2025 shows Bitcoin trading approximately 25% below its all-time high, creating what analysts describe as an attractive entry point for both retail and institutional investors. This positioning followed months of consolidation after the 2024 halving event, which reduced new Bitcoin supply by 50%. Historical patterns suggest such consolidation periods typically precede significant upward movements, particularly when combined with favorable external conditions. The current rally demonstrates remarkable resilience compared to previous cycles, maintaining momentum despite occasional volatility that characterizes cryptocurrency markets. The Catch-Up Trading Phenomenon Explained One primary driver involves what market specialists term “catch-up trading.” Throughout late 2024, traditional safe-haven assets like gold experienced substantial gains while Bitcoin remained relatively stable. This divergence created what quantitative analysts call a “valuation gap” between asset classes. When Bitcoin began appreciating in early 2025, it triggered algorithmic trading systems and portfolio rebalancing mechanisms. Institutional investors who had overweight positions in precious metals began allocating funds to digital assets to maintain target portfolio distributions. This rebalancing created sustained buying pressure that extended beyond speculative trading, establishing a more stable foundation for price appreciation. Comparative Asset Performance: Q4 2024 vs Q1 2025 Asset Q4 2024 Return Q1 2025 Return Variance Gold +18.2% +3.1% -15.1% Bitcoin +5.7% +42.3% +36.6% S&P 500 +8.9% +6.4% -2.5% 10-Year Treasury -2.1% +1.8% +3.9% Macroeconomic Environment and Federal Reserve Policy The broader economic landscape provided crucial support for Bitcoin’s appreciation. Market expectations shifted dramatically in early 2025 as inflation metrics showed sustained improvement toward the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Consequently, analysts projected multiple interest rate cuts throughout the year, potentially totaling 75-100 basis points. This anticipated monetary policy shift affects cryptocurrency markets through several channels. First, lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Second, increased liquidity typically flows toward higher-risk, higher-reward investments. Third, dollar weakness often correlates with Bitcoin strength, creating favorable exchange rate conditions for international investors. Regulatory Clarity: A Turning Point for Institutional Adoption Regulatory developments created unprecedented certainty for cryptocurrency markets in early 2025. Several jurisdictions, including the European Union with its comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework and the United Kingdom with its detailed crypto asset regime, established clear operational guidelines. This regulatory maturation addressed longstanding concerns about compliance, custody, and legal certainty. Financial institutions previously hesitant to engage with digital assets gained confidence to develop sophisticated products and services. The resulting infrastructure improvements included: Enhanced custody solutions from traditional financial institutions Standardized reporting frameworks for tax and accounting purposes Clear classification guidelines distinguishing securities from commodities Improved anti-money laundering protocols accepted across jurisdictions Sustained Institutional Capital Inflows Institutional participation reached record levels during this rally, according to exchange-traded fund flow data and on-chain analytics. Bitcoin exchange-traded products globally attracted approximately $2.8 billion in net inflows during the first quarter of 2025 alone. This institutional engagement differs qualitatively from previous cycles. Rather than speculative positioning, current inflows reflect strategic portfolio allocation by pension funds, insurance companies, and endowment funds. These institutions typically employ dollar-cost averaging strategies that create consistent buying pressure regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Their participation signals growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class rather than merely a speculative instrument. Technological and Network Fundamentals Beyond external factors, Bitcoin’s network fundamentals strengthened considerably before the rally. The hash rate, measuring computational power securing the network, reached new all-time highs in February 2025. This increased security makes the network more resistant to attacks, enhancing its store-of-value proposition. Additionally, layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network processed record transaction volumes, demonstrating growing utility for everyday payments. Developer activity also remained robust, with multiple improvement proposals advancing toward implementation. These technological advancements address previous criticisms about scalability and environmental impact, broadening Bitcoin’s appeal to environmentally conscious investors and practical users alike. Global Adoption Patterns and Geographic Shifts Adoption trends revealed interesting geographic variations during this rally. Emerging markets experiencing currency instability showed particularly strong Bitcoin adoption, using it as a hedge against local currency depreciation. Meanwhile, developed markets focused more on Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge. This geographic diversification creates multiple independent demand sources, making the rally more resilient to regional economic shocks. Payment processors reported increased merchant adoption, particularly in sectors like e-commerce and digital services. These real-world use cases complement investment demand, creating a more balanced ecosystem less dependent on purely speculative activity. Conclusion The Bitcoin rally of early 2025 resulted from six interconnected factors creating ideal conditions for appreciation. Catch-up trading following gold’s outperformance, attractive pricing relative to all-time highs, favorable macroeconomic expectations, regulatory clarity, sustained institutional inflows, and strengthening network fundamentals collectively propelled this movement. This multi-factor analysis demonstrates cryptocurrency market maturation, with diverse drivers replacing the single-narrative dynamics of previous cycles. As markets evolve, understanding these complex interactions becomes increasingly crucial for investors, regulators, and observers navigating the digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: How does Bitcoin’s current rally compare to previous cycles? This rally demonstrates greater institutional participation and regulatory clarity than previous cycles. While past surges often relied heavily on retail speculation, current movements show balanced demand from multiple investor categories with more sophisticated risk management approaches. Q2: What role do interest rates play in Bitcoin’s price movement? Interest rates significantly influence Bitcoin through opportunity cost calculations and liquidity conditions. Lower rates reduce the attractiveness of yield-bearing traditional assets while increasing system-wide liquidity, conditions historically favorable for alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Q3: How important is regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency markets? Regulatory clarity provides essential certainty for institutional investors requiring compliance frameworks. Clear guidelines enable traditional financial institutions to develop products, improve custody solutions, and integrate digital assets into existing investment frameworks with confidence. Q4: Are institutional investors driving Bitcoin’s price permanently higher? Institutional participation creates more stable demand but doesn’t guarantee permanent price appreciation. These investors employ sophisticated strategies that may include profit-taking during volatility. However, their involvement generally reduces extreme volatility and establishes higher baseline valuations. Q5: What risks could potentially reverse the current Bitcoin rally? Potential reversal risks include unexpected hawkish monetary policy shifts, regulatory setbacks in major jurisdictions, technological vulnerabilities, macroeconomic deterioration affecting risk appetite, or substantial liquidations from over-leveraged positions in derivative markets.

Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, 9 of the top 10 coins per market capitalisation have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is up by 0.8% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $93,583. This is the smallest increase in the category today. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 1.8%, now changing hands at $3,228. The category’s highest increase is 9.6% by XRP , currently standing at $2.35. It’s followed by ETH. At the same time, Tron (TRX) is the only red coin, with a change of 0.1%, now standing at $0.2915. Looking at the top 100 coins, 97 coins saw increases. Of these, three are double-digit.

On the other hand, of the three red coins, Midnight (MIDNIGHT) fell the most: 7.8% to $0.07978. Meanwhile, Bill Miller IV, chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners , said that BTC was down 6% in 2025. “For an asset with that level of volatility over the long run, that’s not a big deal ,” he said. “ “It looks like it’s ready to go again,” Miller said. “I personally expect it to break out to a higher high than its all-time high from the fall.” JUST IN: BILLIONAIRE BILL MILLER IV JUST TOLD CNBC #BITCOIN WILL SET A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH WITHIN WEEKS IT’S COMING. HODL pic.twitter.com/E3iAa3leN7 — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) January 5, 2026 ‘Reflective Bounce’ Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of the Coin Bureau , commented that the first Monday of 2026 saw gold, silver, and BTC moving in the same direction. “It would be tempting to label this a ‘risk-off’ or dollar debasement trade and predict that Bitcoin and gold are converging – but this isn’t what’s happening here,” Puckrin says. “In fact, Bitcoin and precious metals are being driven by very different forces.” Gold and silver are extending last year’s momentum. It stalled somewhat at the end of the year, the co-founder explains, providing investors on the sidelines with an entry point. However, BTC “was so oversold at the end of last year that we’re now seeing a reflexive bounce.” Moreover, Friday, which was the first full ETF trading day of 2026, saw $471.3 million of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting institutions are piling back in. “We’re seeing more of the same today as investors come back to their desks after the festive season,” he says. “But this doesn’t mean that Bitcoin and gold are converging, or that Bitcoin will now rally every time geopolitical tensions escalate. For now, it’s a simple coincidence,” Puckrin concludes. According to Glassnode , BTC is stabilising within the $80,000–$95,000 range as momentum recovers and sell pressure eases. $BTC is stabilising within the $80K–$95K range as momentum recovers and sell pressure fades. Spot liquidity is thin, open interest is rebuilding cautiously, and options markets point to near-term volatility.

The price jumped from the intraday low of $92,474 to the high of $94,634 and has been trading relatively sideways since. Also, it’s up 6.6% in a week, trading within a notably wider range of $87,409–$94,420. If the coin holds above $93,000, it may proceed towards $95,300, followed by $97,000 and finally $100,000. Yet, a fall could drag the price back below $90,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,228. It has increased from the day’s low of $3,138 to the intraday high of $3,253. Also, ETH has outperformed BTC in the 7-day period, with an 8.5% increase. It moved between $2,953 and $3,240. Should the price firmly hold the $3,300, it would open a path towards $3,470, $3,600, and $3,800. A turn in the market could see ETH drop below $3,100. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has seen another notable increase, rising within the neutral territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 49 today , compared to 42 yesterday and to its intra-month low of just 21. It is out of the fear zone for the first time since October 2025. When it comes to the short- and mid-term outlook, the optimism seems to still be rising. Zooming out, they appear to be far more concerned and cautious in the longer term. ETF Inflows Continue Like the year, the first day of the year’s first full week of trading began in the green. The US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $697.25 million in inflows on Monday. This is the highest amount since October 2025. The total net inflow rose to $57.78 billion. Also, like in the previous session, nine of the twelve BTC ETFs recorded inflows, while none saw outflows. BlackRock again posted the highest amount on Monday of $372.47 million. It’s followed by Fidelity’s $191.19 million and Bitwise’s $38.45 million. Also, the US ETH ETFs posted positive flows on 5 January as well, with $168.13 million . The total net inflow hovers around $12.5 billion. Of the nine funds, five recorded inflows, and none posted outflows – the same as the previous trading day on Friday. BlackRock took in $102.9 million in inflows, while Grayscale posted $23.66 million in total on this day, significantly lower than the session. Meanwhile, Strategy reported a $17.44 billion unrealised loss on digital assets for the three months ended 31 December 2025. Additionally, for the full year, Michael Saylor’s company said it recorded a $5.4 billion unrealised loss on digital assets and a $1.55 billion associated deferred tax benefit. @Strategy has expanded its Bitcoin treasury again — adding 1,287 BTC in early January and lifting total holdings to 673,783 BTC. #Strategy #Bitcoin https://t.co/mB82IzfVHl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 5, 2026 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market recorded an increase over the past 24 hours. Also, the US stock market started the week with a session that closed higher as well. By the closing time on Monday, 5 January, the S&P 500 was up by 0.64%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.77%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.77%. This comes after the US military entered Venezuela and abducted its president, Nicolás Maduro, with the US president Donald Trump claiming the US is “in charge” of Venezuela – the country with the world’s largest oil reserves. Is this rally sustainable? The crypto market has more room rise in the mid-term. Bar significant macroeconomic effects, analysts argue that we could see crypto prices rise moderately in this time frame.

A recent analysis from the respected on-chain intelligence firm Glassnode, published on June 5, 2025, delivers a measured perspective on the current Bitcoin landscape. The firm’s data indicates that while market conditions show improvement, Bitcoin funding rates have not yet reached the historical threshold that typically precedes a strong, sustained bullish reversal. This finding offers traders and long-term holders a vital, data-driven checkpoint amidst fluctuating market narratives. Understanding Bitcoin Funding Rates and Market Sentiment Perpetual futures contracts, a dominant force in crypto trading, utilize a mechanism called the funding rate to keep their price tethered to the underlying spot market. This rate is a periodic payment exchanged between long and short position holders. Consequently, analysts scrutinize these rates as a powerful gauge of market sentiment. A persistently positive funding rate suggests traders are overly optimistic, paying a premium to hold long positions, which can sometimes precede a market correction. Conversely, deeply negative rates often signal extreme fear. However, a sustained, moderately positive rate can indicate healthy, building bullish momentum without excessive leverage. Glassnode’s report specifically tracks the seven-day moving average of these rates across major centralized exchanges. This methodology smooths out daily volatility to reveal the underlying trend. The firm’s historical research establishes a clear benchmark: for a market environment to transition into a confirmed bull run, funding rates need to stabilize consistently above the 0.01% level. This level represents a balance where optimism is present but not yet frothy, allowing room for organic growth. The Current Data: A Snapshot of Cautious Optimism Glassnode’s latest data presents a nuanced picture. The seven-day moving average for BTC perpetual futures funding rates recently dipped to a neutral point around 0% before experiencing a modest rebound. It climbed to approximately 0.005% and has since settled at a level near 0.003% over the past 24-hour period. This trajectory is undeniably positive compared to the negative territory seen during recent market downturns. It reflects a shift away from pervasive bearishness and toward a more balanced or slightly optimistic stance among derivatives traders. Nevertheless, the critical insight from Glassnode is that this current level, while favorable, remains below the established 0.01% signal line. The firm emphasizes that the market has not yet generated the sustained, elevated funding rate environment that has historically accompanied the early phases of powerful bullish trends. This analysis tempers immediate expectations for a dramatic surge while acknowledging the constructive shift in market mechanics. The Historical Context of Funding Rate Thresholds To appreciate Glassnode’s conclusion, one must examine past market cycles. During the consolidation phases following major drawdowns, funding rates often linger in neutral or slightly positive territory. The transition into a robust bull market is frequently marked by a decisive and sustained break above the 0.01% average. This threshold acts not as a simple on/off switch but as a confirmation of a fundamental shift in trader behavior and capital flow. The table below illustrates typical funding rate environments across different market phases, based on aggregated historical data from analytics providers: Market Phase Typical Funding Rate (7D MA) Trader Sentiment Bear Market / Capitulation Persistently Negative ( Extreme Fear, Short Dominance Accumulation / Neutral ~0% to +0.005% Cautious, Balanced Early Bull Market Confirmation Sustained > +0.01% Growing Confidence Mid-Bull Market / Euphoria Very High (> +0.05%) Excessive Greed, Leverage According to this framework, Glassnode’s data places the current Bitcoin market firmly in the “Accumulation / Neutral” phase. The movement from negative to positive is a necessary first step, but the journey toward a confirmed bullish structure requires further development. Broader Market Indicators and Expert Perspectives Funding rates do not exist in a vacuum. Prudent analysts always cross-reference them with other on-chain and macroeconomic signals. For instance, Glassnode and other firms like CryptoQuant and IntoTheBlock also monitor: Exchange Net Flow: Sustained outflows from exchanges often indicate a shift from trading to long-term holding. MVRV Ratio: This metric compares market value to realized value, highlighting whether investors are in profit or loss on average. Active Address Growth: Increasing network activity can signal rising adoption and utility. Currently, many of these complementary metrics also show signs of recovery from bear market lows but have not yet flashed unequivocally bullish signals. This confluence supports Glassnode’s measured stance. The firm’s analysis is rooted in empirical data rather than speculation, reinforcing its authoritative position in the analytics space. Their consistent methodology allows market participants to track a clear, quantifiable metric against historical precedents. The Impact on Trader Strategy and Market Psychology The immediate impact of this analysis is a calibration of expectations. For derivatives traders, it suggests that while the risk of a sharp long squeeze may have diminished, the conditions for a high-conviction, leveraged long trend trade are not fully present. For spot investors and institutions, it may reinforce a strategy of phased accumulation rather than urgent, all-in buying. Psychologically, data of this nature helps counteract the extreme narratives that often dominate crypto social media. It provides a factual anchor, reminding participants that market recoveries are processes, not single events. The gradual rise in funding rates, if sustained, could build a more stable foundation for future growth than a sudden, speculative spike. Conclusion Glassnode’s latest analysis of Bitcoin funding rates offers a masterclass in data-driven market interpretation. The firm confirms a positive shift in derivatives market sentiment, moving from neutral to cautiously optimistic territory. However, the core conclusion remains clear: the current seven-day moving average, hovering around 0.003%, has not yet achieved the sustained level above 0.01% that has historically been a component of stronger bullish reversals. This insight is invaluable for navigating the current market phase, emphasizing patience and confirmation over reactionary decisions. As always, integrating this single metric with a broader dashboard of on-chain and fundamental indicators provides the most robust framework for understanding Bitcoin’s complex market dynamics. FAQs Q1: What are Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rates? A1: Funding rates are periodic payments between traders in perpetual futures contracts designed to tether the contract price to the spot price. Positive rates mean longs pay shorts, indicating bullish sentiment, while negative rates mean shorts pay longs, indicating bearish sentiment. Q2: Why does Glassnode use the 0.01% level as a key threshold? A2: Based on historical market cycle analysis, a sustained seven-day moving average above 0.01% has frequently coincided with the early stages of confirmed bullish market trends, indicating building but not yet excessive optimism. Q3: Does a low funding rate guarantee the price won’t go up? A3: No, it does not guarantee anything. Funding rates are a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. Prices can increase with low funding rates, but historically, strong, sustained bull runs have often been accompanied by periods of sustainably positive rates. Q4: What other data should I look at alongside funding rates? A4: For a holistic view, consider exchange net flows, the MVRV ratio, active address counts, hash rate, and broader macroeconomic conditions. No single metric provides a complete picture. Q5: How often does Glassnode update this funding rate analysis? A5: Glassnode updates its on-chain metrics, including derivatives data, in near real-time on its platform. The specific analysis referencing the 7-day moving average and historical thresholds is typically highlighted in regular market reports and insights shared via its research publications and social channels.

Speaking exclusively to DL News, Duong detailed how advancing quantum computing technology poses unprecedented risks to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This Bitcoin quantum computing threat represents one of the most significant challenges facing blockchain technology as we approach 2025. Understanding the Bitcoin Quantum Computing Threat Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena to process information fundamentally differently than classical computers. These machines could potentially solve complex mathematical problems exponentially faster. Consequently, they threaten the cryptographic foundations securing Bitcoin and other blockchain networks. David Duong’s analysis specifically highlights two primary attack vectors. First, quantum computers could disrupt Bitcoin’s mining ecosystem through hyper-efficient mining operations. Second, and more urgently, they could derive private keys from public addresses to steal funds directly. Currently, Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptography. This system relies on mathematical problems that classical computers find practically impossible to solve within reasonable timeframes. However, quantum computers running Shor’s algorithm could theoretically break this encryption. Duong emphasizes that private key derivation represents the core challenge. “Given the current pace of technological development,” he notes, “the threat of private key derivation is the central issue facing Bitcoin.” Quantifying the Cryptocurrency Security Risk Approximately one-third of Bitcoin’s 21 million maximum supply sits in vulnerable positions. This vulnerability stems from specific usage patterns and wallet management practices. Bitcoin addresses fall into different risk categories based on their transaction history and key exposure. The most vulnerable addresses include those where public keys have appeared on the blockchain. Typically, this happens when users spend funds from an address, revealing the public key in the transaction data. Researchers categorize the risk levels as follows: High Risk: Addresses with exposed public keys (approximately 33% of supply) Medium Risk: Reused addresses without exposed keys Low Risk: Fresh addresses with single-use patterns This vulnerability distribution creates a pressing timeline for mitigation. As quantum computing advances, the window for securing these assets narrows significantly. The cryptocurrency community must address this issue before quantum computers reach sufficient scale and stability. Historical Context and Technological Timeline The quantum computing threat to cryptography isn’t new. Scientists have discussed it since the 1990s when Peter Shor developed his famous algorithm. However, practical quantum computers remained theoretical until recent years. Today, companies like Google, IBM, and various research institutions make steady progress. They regularly announce qubit count increases and error reduction improvements. Most experts estimate that cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) remain 10-15 years away. Yet, the “store now, decrypt later” attack model changes the risk calculation. Malicious actors could collect encrypted data today and decrypt it later when quantum computers become available. For Bitcoin, this means addresses with exposed public keys already face potential future compromise. Comparative Blockchain Security Analysis Different blockchain networks face varying levels of quantum vulnerability based on their cryptographic choices and consensus mechanisms. Bitcoin’s specific architecture presents unique challenges. The network’s proof-of-work consensus could face disruption from quantum mining advantages. However, Duong identifies private key security as the more immediate concern. Other cryptocurrencies employ different signature schemes with varying quantum resistance. For example, some newer projects implement lattice-based cryptography or hash-based signatures. These approaches offer stronger post-quantum security guarantees. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s massive market dominance and established infrastructure make its vulnerability particularly consequential for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Quantum Vulnerability Comparison Across Major Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrency Current Signature Scheme Quantum Resistance Migration Complexity Bitcoin ECDSA Low High Ethereum ECDSA Low High Cardano EdDSA Medium Medium Quantum Resistant Ledger Dilithium High Low Institutional Research and Market Implications Coinbase’s institutional research division provides analysis for major investors and financial institutions. David Duong’s warning carries significant weight within traditional finance circles. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has accelerated in recent years. Major corporations, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds now hold Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies. Consequently, quantum vulnerability concerns could influence investment decisions and risk assessments. The potential market impacts are substantial. If investors perceive heightened security risks, they might demand premium discounts for vulnerable Bitcoin. Alternatively, they could shift toward quantum-resistant alternatives. Already, some institutional players incorporate quantum risk into their cryptocurrency due diligence processes. They evaluate not just current security but future-proofing strategies. Technical Mitigation Strategies and Development Roadmaps The Bitcoin development community actively researches quantum-resistant solutions. Several approaches could address the vulnerability. One option involves implementing a soft fork to add quantum-resistant signature schemes. This method would allow users to move funds to secure addresses without disrupting network consensus. Another approach focuses on improving wallet software to minimize public key exposure. Key development initiatives include: Post-quantum cryptography integration research Improved address management protocols Quantum-resistant multisignature schemes Educational campaigns for secure storage practices These technical solutions require careful implementation to maintain Bitcoin’s decentralization and security principles. The community must balance urgency with thorough testing and consensus building. Regulatory and Policy Considerations Government agencies and international standards organizations monitor quantum computing developments closely. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has run a multi-year post-quantum cryptography standardization process. Their selected algorithms will influence future security protocols across industries, including cryptocurrency. Regulatory bodies might eventually mandate quantum-resistant standards for financial institutions holding digital assets. Such requirements could accelerate Bitcoin’s cryptographic transition. However, they also raise questions about protocol governance and decentralization. The tension between external regulation and community-driven development will likely shape Bitcoin’s quantum response strategy. Conclusion The Bitcoin quantum computing threat identified by Coinbase researcher David Duong represents a significant long-term challenge for cryptocurrency security. Approximately one-third of Bitcoin’s supply faces potential vulnerability to future quantum attacks. While immediate risk remains low, the cryptocurrency community must begin preparing today. Technical solutions exist but require careful implementation and broad consensus. As quantum computing advances, Bitcoin’s response will test its adaptability and resilience. The network’s ability to address this Bitcoin quantum computing threat will influence its position as digital gold for decades to come. FAQs Q1: How soon could quantum computers actually threaten Bitcoin? Most experts estimate cryptographically relevant quantum computers remain 10-15 years away. However, the “store now, decrypt later” attack model means vulnerable addresses already face potential future compromise. Q2: What makes some Bitcoin addresses more vulnerable than others? Addresses become vulnerable when their public keys appear on the blockchain. This typically happens when users spend funds from an address, revealing the public key in transaction data for quantum computers to potentially target later. Q3: Can Bitcoin upgrade to quantum-resistant cryptography? Yes, the Bitcoin development community actively researches post-quantum cryptographic solutions. Implementation would likely occur through a soft fork, allowing users to transition funds to quantum-resistant addresses without disrupting network consensus. Q4: Should Bitcoin holders take immediate action? While immediate risk remains low, security-conscious holders should use best practices: avoid address reuse, use hardware wallets, and monitor developments in post-quantum cryptography for future migration guidance. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most cryptocurrencies using ECDSA or similar cryptography face similar quantum vulnerabilities. However, some newer projects implement inherently quantum-resistant algorithms, and established networks like Ethereum also research post-quantum solutions.

Here are some of the possible reasons behind the asset’s recent resurgence, which drove it from under $1.85 to $2.40 in the span of just several days. 3 Possible Reasons Although the entire crypto market has shown signs of revival since the start of the new year, XRP’s performance has dwarfed that of many of its larger-cap competitors. Perhaps the most evident reason behind its surge past $2.00 is the overall inflows into the spot Ripple ETFs, as the financial vehicles’ green streak has continued for nearly two months since the first one saw the light of day. January 5 was a particularly positive day, with $46.10 million entering the funds. In fact, this was the highest single-day inflow recorded since December 3. Overall, the five spot XRP ETFs have attracted $1.23 billion in net inflows since November 13. The second reason could be related to the declining XRP reserves on centralized exchanges. Data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant show a trend in which the number of tokens sitting on trading platforms has dropped by almost 60% since the October 2025 peak, to around 1.8 billion coins. Such moves are considered bullish for the underlying asset as they reduce the immediate selling pressure. In third place comes the recent behavior by whales. These large market participants went on a massive selling spree since October, disposing of several billion tokens by the end of the year. However, their holdings have stabilized over the past week or so, and there have been no reports of large sell-offs. What’s Next? After surging by roughly 30% in a week, analysts have rushed to offer their views on what comes next for XRP’s price. CryptoWZRD noted earlier today that both trading pairs, against USD and BTC, have “rallied strongly as anticipated,” and predicted that “further upside is likely, which will help XRP push higher.” CW claimed that the token has now broken out of a familiar structure and aims to surge toward its 2018 all-time high of $3.40. If it breaks through, the analyst predicted that the rocket will launch even further as there are no further resistance levels above. $XRP is steadily rising toward its previous resistance level, the ATH. The rocket will launches from the ATH. A breakout of the ATH means there are no further resistance levels. The current situation is like installing a rocket on the launch pad. pic.twitter.com/PNUu1sYoNp — CW (@CW8900) January 6, 2026 The post 3 Reasons Behind XRP’s Massive Surge and What’s Next for Ripple’s Price appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) ETF|Ripple (XRP) Price,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The banking behemoth has filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to launch exchange-traded funds tracking the performance of BTC, and also Solana’s SOL. The report by Reuters indicated that most US banks have completely changed their views on the digital asset industry ever since Donald Trump won the presidential elections last year and made countless pro-crypto statements. The overall regulatory landscape is entirely different in the US now, which has opened the doors for more legacy participants to join the cryptocurrency industry. Spot crypto ETFs have seen spectacular success for the most part, and they appear as the most appropriate entrance path for certain investors. Morgan Stanley has a long history with the digital asset industry, most of which has been positive. Alongside BNY Mellon, it has been among the few US banks to openly embrace bitcoin and a few altcoins over the years. Even before the ETF launched in January 2024, it had exposure to BTC through Grayscale’s GBTC trust. Some of its execs have made numerous bullish comments, including a prediction that bitcoin might become a global reserve currency one day. SoSoValue data reveals that the Solana ETFs have attracted almost $800 million in net inflows since they went live in mid-2025. The spot Bitcoin ETFs are the undisputed leader, with almost $58 billion in total net inflows since January 2024.

This innovative platform, announced in Q1 2025, allows global traders to gain 24/7 leveraged exposure to major U.S. stock indices using cryptocurrency as collateral, effectively bridging two previously distinct financial worlds. BitMEX Equity Perps: A Deep Dive into the New Product BitMEX’s Equity Perps are derivative contracts that track the price of underlying traditional financial assets. Specifically, the initial offering includes perpetual swaps for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices. Unlike traditional exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or futures, these contracts have no expiry date. Consequently, traders can hold positions indefinitely, provided they manage the funding rate mechanism that keeps the contract price aligned with the spot index value. The core innovation lies in the collateral requirement: users must deposit cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) to open and maintain these stock-index positions. This structure eliminates the need for a traditional fiat-based brokerage account or bank transfer, streamlining access for the global crypto-native audience. The Strategic Context and Market Evolution This launch does not occur in a vacuum. It represents a strategic response to growing demand from cryptocurrency investors seeking diversified exposure without exiting the digital asset ecosystem. Historically, accessing U.S. equities required converting crypto to fiat currency, a process involving multiple intermediaries, fees, and regulatory hurdles. BitMEX’s product directly addresses this friction. Furthermore, the move follows a similar announcement from competitor Bitget, which signaled its intent to offer traditional financial asset services. This trend indicates a broader industry shift where major crypto exchanges are expanding their product suites to become comprehensive, cross-asset trading platforms. The race to provide seamless, crypto-denominated access to global markets is clearly accelerating. Expert Analysis on Risk, Regulation, and Impact Financial technology analysts highlight several critical considerations. First, the use of leveraged derivatives on volatile underlying assets (both crypto collateral and stock indices) significantly amplifies risk. A sharp downturn in either market could trigger cascading liquidations. Second, the regulatory landscape remains complex. While the products track U.S. indices, they are offered by a platform operating outside traditional U.S. securities jurisdiction, creating a novel regulatory grey area. Experts from firms like Delphi Digital note that such products must demonstrate robust risk management and transparency to gain long-term trust. However, the potential impact is substantial. By providing 24/7 access, Equity Perps cater to a global audience across all time zones, challenging the conventional 9-to-5 trading day of Wall Street and offering new hedging strategies for portfolio managers. Mechanics and User Experience of Crypto-Collateralized Trading Understanding the user flow is essential. A trader begins by depositing Bitcoin into their BitMEX margin wallet. They can then open a position on, for example, the S&P 500 Equity Perp contract. The platform calculates the position’s value and required maintenance margin in USD but holds the collateral in BTC. This creates a unique risk profile: the trader’s collateral value fluctuates with the crypto market independently of their stock index position. Key features include: Leverage: Offers adjustable leverage, allowing controlled amplification of market exposure. 24/7 Settlement: Enables entry and exit at any time, unlike traditional market hours. Cross-Margin Utility: Allows a single pool of crypto collateral to support multiple derivative positions. This model maximizes capital efficiency for users already deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Comparative Landscape: BitMEX vs. Traditional and Crypto Brokers The following table contrasts the new offering with existing avenues for stock index exposure: Platform Type Example Asset Access Collateral Type Trading Hours Primary Audience Traditional Broker Fidelity, Charles Schwab Stocks, ETFs, Mutual Funds Fiat Currency (USD) Market Hours Retail/Institutional Investors Crypto-Native Exchange (New) BitMEX Equity Perps Derivatives on Indices Cryptocurrency 24/7 Crypto-Native Traders Hybrid Platform Bitget, Others Announcing Similar Mixed (Crypto & TradFi Derivatives) Dual (Crypto & Fiat) 24/7 for Crypto Products Cross-Asset Traders This comparison clearly positions BitMEX’s product as a specialized tool for a specific, growing demographic, rather than a direct replacement for traditional services. Conclusion The launch of BitMEX Equity Perps marks a significant step in the maturation and integration of cryptocurrency markets with the global financial system. By enabling 24/7, crypto-collateralized trading of U.S. stock indices, BitMEX is not just launching a new product but is pioneering a new access model. This development underscores the industry’s shift towards providing comprehensive financial services, blurring the lines between asset classes. While risks related to leverage and volatility remain paramount, the innovation demonstrates the relentless evolution of fintech, offering traders unprecedented flexibility and cementing the role of crypto assets as functional financial collateral. The success of this BitMEX Equity Perps venture will likely influence the roadmap for every major digital asset exchange in the coming years. FAQs Q1: What exactly are BitMEX Equity Perps? BitMEX Equity Perps are perpetual swap derivative contracts that track the price of major U.S. stock market indices, like the S&P 500. They allow traders to speculate on the index’s price movement 24 hours a day, using cryptocurrency as collateral to open leveraged positions. Q2: What cryptocurrencies can I use as collateral? While specific details may evolve, BitMEX has historically accepted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as collateral for its margin trading products. Users should confirm the accepted collateral types directly on the BitMEX platform. Q3: How does this differ from buying an S&P 500 ETF? An ETF represents direct ownership of a basket of stocks. BitMEX Equity Perps are leveraged derivatives contracts; you own a contract for difference, not the underlying assets. This involves funding rates, leverage risk, and crypto collateral, unlike a traditional ETF purchase in a brokerage account. Q4: What are the biggest risks with this product? The primary risks are high leverage magnification of losses, the volatility of both the stock index and the cryptocurrency used as collateral, and the complexity of perpetual swap funding mechanisms. Liquidations can occur rapidly if the market moves against your position. Q5: Is this service available to U.S.-based traders? Due to regulatory restrictions, BitMEX does not currently offer its services to residents of the United States or other prohibited jurisdictions. Traders must comply with their local regulations regarding derivative trading and cryptocurrency use.

The Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Ratio, a key technical indicator tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, reached historically significant levels in November 2024 that have consistently marked major market turning points throughout Bitcoin’s fifteen-year history. This development suggests the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could have substantial room for further appreciation in the coming months. Understanding the Short-Term Holder Ratio Indicator The Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Ratio represents a sophisticated on-chain metric that measures the profitability of Bitcoin addresses holding coins for less than 155 days. Glassnode calculates this ratio by analyzing the unrealized profit or loss positions of these recent investors. When the ratio approaches extremely low levels, it typically indicates widespread capitulation among newer market participants. Historically, such conditions have preceded significant market recoveries. Blockchain analysts consider this metric particularly valuable because it reflects real investor behavior rather than speculative sentiment. The data comes directly from Bitcoin’s transparent ledger, providing objective evidence about market psychology. Furthermore, the indicator’s consistency across multiple market cycles gives it substantial credibility among institutional and retail investors alike. Historical Context and Market Cycles Bitcoin has experienced four major bear markets since its inception in 2009, each followed by substantial bull runs. The Short-Term Holder P/L Ratio reached critical levels during each of these bottoms: 2011 Bottom: Ratio dropped to 0.015 before Bitcoin surged from $2 to $1,100 2015 Bottom: Ratio reached 0.018 preceding a rally from $200 to $20,000 2018 Bottom: Ratio hit 0.020 before recovery from $3,200 to $69,000 2022 Bottom: Ratio touched 0.025 leading to gains from $16,000 to recent highs The November 2024 reading of 0.013 represents the lowest level in Bitcoin’s history, suggesting potentially extreme capitulation. This development occurred amid regulatory clarity in major markets and increasing institutional adoption through spot Bitcoin ETFs. Current Market Position and Recovery Signals Since reaching the 0.013 level in November, the Short-Term Holder Ratio has recovered to approximately 0.45 as of March 2025. This represents a substantial improvement but remains below the critical 1.0 threshold that historically signals the transition to a strong bull market. The current position suggests that while the worst may be over, the market still has room for improvement before entering a full-blown bullish phase. Market analysts note several supporting factors for this interpretation: Supporting Market Factors (March 2025) Factor Current Status Market Impact ETF Inflows Consistent positive net flows Institutional demand support Hash Rate All-time highs Network security strength Active Addresses Growing steadily Increasing adoption metrics Exchange Reserves Declining trend Reduced selling pressure These fundamental factors combine with the technical indicator to create a compelling case for Bitcoin’s improved market structure. The convergence of multiple positive signals provides stronger evidence than any single metric alone. Expert Analysis and Market Implications Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the importance of context when interpreting these signals. Jameson Lopp, Chief Technology Officer at Casa and long-time Bitcoin advocate, explains: “On-chain metrics provide valuable insights, but they must be considered alongside macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments. The current environment shows multiple positive indicators aligning.” Similarly, Lex Sokolin, former Global Fintech Co-Head at ConsenSys, notes: “The institutional adoption wave through regulated products has changed Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Traditional technical indicators now interact with new capital flows, creating more complex but potentially more stable market structures.” Risk Factors and Considerations Despite the promising signals, several risk factors warrant consideration. Regulatory developments in major economies could impact market sentiment, while macroeconomic conditions including interest rate policies and inflation trends continue to influence cryptocurrency valuations. Additionally, technological developments in competing blockchain networks and potential security concerns represent ongoing considerations for investors. Market participants should also recognize that past performance does not guarantee future results. While historical patterns provide useful guidance, each market cycle presents unique characteristics influenced by evolving adoption, technological maturity, and regulatory frameworks. Conclusion The Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Ratio suggests Bitcoin may have established its market bottom in November 2024, based on historical patterns and current data analysis. This technical indicator, combined with improving fundamentals and institutional adoption, paints a cautiously optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s medium-term prospects. However, investors should maintain balanced perspectives, considering both the promising signals and remaining risk factors as the cryptocurrency market continues to mature and evolve in 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Ratio? The Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Ratio measures the profitability of Bitcoin addresses holding coins for less than 155 days. It calculates the average unrealized profit or loss position of these recent investors, providing insights into market sentiment and potential turning points. Q2: Why is the November 2024 reading significant? The November 2024 reading of 0.013 represents the lowest level in Bitcoin’s history for this indicator. Historically, such extreme readings have consistently marked major market bottoms, making this development particularly noteworthy for analysts and investors. Q3: How does this indicator differ from price-based technical analysis? Unlike traditional price-based technical analysis, the Short-Term Holder Ratio derives from on-chain data reflecting actual investor behavior. This provides more objective evidence about market psychology since it comes directly from Bitcoin’s transparent blockchain rather than exchange price charts. Q4: What other indicators should investors consider alongside this ratio? Investors should consider multiple factors including exchange reserves, active address growth, hash rate trends, institutional flows through ETFs, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments. No single indicator provides complete market understanding. Q5: Does this guarantee Bitcoin will enter a bull market? No technical indicator guarantees future market movements. While historical patterns show strong correlations, each market cycle presents unique characteristics. The current signals suggest improved conditions but investors should maintain balanced perspectives considering both opportunities and risks.

Why This Key Level Will Decide Bitcoin’s Fate,https://cryptopotato.com/the-final-barrier-why-this-key-level-will-decide-bitcoins-fate/,cryptopotato,"Bitcoin (BTC) entered 2026 with a strong start, showing more than 7% gain over the past week. The asset is at around $93,600 at press time, rising 1% in the last 24 hours. Daily trading volume remains high at $51.5 billion. On Tuesday morning, Bitcoin climbed to its highest level in nearly two months, nearing the $95,000 mark. Unlike previous moves, the weekend rally held through Monday, a change from recent patterns where gains were often erased quickly. Price Moves Toward Key Resistance Bitcoin has rebounded from the lower end of its weekly range near $86,200. This level has acted as a support area in the past. The price has now climbed to test the top of this range near $93,500. Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that a close above this level would mark a potential breakout. The asset is currently trading above the range high, but the weekly close will be crucial. Notably, the move also comes as BTC breaks above a downtrend line that has been in place since October 2025. This trendline, drawn from lower highs, has now been breached. Holding above $93,500 is seen by many traders as the level that could shift the mid-term picture. “$93,500 needs to hold as support for mid-term bullish bias,” said Rekt Capital. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Chart 6.1. Source: Rekt Capital/X Despite recent gains, market analysts remain cautious. Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin closed its 12-month candle below $93,500. Based on historical cycles, similar levels have remained unbroken for several years until the next halving year. “If indeed Bitcoin has begun a bear market, price could overextend beyond $93,500 over the coming months… before continuing lower.” Sykodelic, another market analyst, pointed to strong buying activity driving recent gains. They noted a breakout in the On-Balance Volume indicator and mentioned that Coinbase is showing signs of a spot premium. Still, they added a caution: “We need to get above and hold $94.5K. If not, we may revisit $89K.” Macro Trends May Be Shifting Analyst Lark Davis drew attention to a technical crossover on the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. A monthly MACD golden cross has formed, which last occurred in 2019. At that time, Bitcoin began a major rally in the months that followed. “Not official QE yet… but it sure looks like QE and smells like QE,” Davis said. The crossover suggests the Fed’s balance sheet may be expanding again after months of decline. This shift in liquidity may affect markets in early 2026, especially risk assets like Bitcoin. Support Levels and Market Outlook Michaël van de Poppe identified the $90,000–$91,000 range as a short-term level that needs to hold. This zone also lines up with the 21-day moving average. A failure to hold could lead to a retest of lower levels. “If that holds and a higher low forms, then we could be looking at $100K,” he commented. Data from Glassnode shows that Bitcoin is recovering from a correction. The current phase is described as a consolidation, though market conditions remain uncertain. While many metrics are turning positive, some analysts believe this rally could be the final leg before a larger move down. The post The Final Barrier?

According to an X post shared by the developers, the wallet migration bug was found in Bitcoin Core wallet versions 30.0 & 30.1. They also revealed that under rare circumstances, migrating a legacy (BDB) wallet can potentially end in the deletion of all wallet files on the same node, and if those wallets aren’t backed up, they say it can result in a loss of funds. Is there a bug in the Bitcoin Core wallet? In a statement shared on their website, the Bitcoin Core developers claim that the bug is triggered only during attempts to migrate the legacy wallet, as it requires the presence of a default (unnamed) wallet.dat file, which was released five years ago and has not been created by default since 0.21, and fails to be migrated or loaded. They added that a condition that could trigger this is when pruning is enabled, and the wallet is unloaded while pruning is in progress. The developers have promised that a fix will become available in Bitcoin Core 30.2, but out of an abundance of caution, they got rid of the binaries for affected releases from bitcoincore.org . However, until the fixed version becomes available, users have been urged to avoid migrating their legacy wallets using versions 30.0 or 30.1, the GUI or RPC, until v30.2 is released. They have also claimed that only the legacy wallet migration process was affected as a result of the bug. “You can continue using Bitcoin Core normally, including existing wallets and running a node without wallets,” the post concluded. According to Lacie Zhang, market analyst at Bitget Wallet, technically proficient users can assess their exposure to the bug by checking which version of Bitcoin Core they are running to determine whether their wallet is a legacy wallet. They can also inspect their respective “debug.log” to see whether pruning is enabled and whether any migration attempts have already occurred, and by reviewing the directory layout to confirm whether “-walletdir” points to a custom or mounted location. “Risk is highest if all these conditions are present and a migration has either been attempted or is pending,” she said. “If no migration has occurred yet, users should immediately back up the entire data directory to external media and avoid restarting or upgrading until moving to version 30.2 or later.” Response to the announcement has been hostile The Bitcoin Core developers have acknowledged the bug and are deploying control measures in what many consider a professionally coordinated response. However, Crypto Twitter has unloaded in typical fashion, with many highlighting how low the platform has sunk. Some just dropped discouraging commentary, while others tried to recruit others to join them in dumping the platform for a better alternative. The ire from the Bitcoin Core community comes after Core v30 caused what is being referred to as a minor civil war among developers who disagreed over easements to arbitrary data storage on Bitcoin’s blockchain, claiming it turned BTC into a data dump. Before it was finally released, it was heavily reviewed and saw a delay that lasted weeks, only for it to come out with a serious bug. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The move marks a significant step in the Wall Street giant’s growing commitment to digital assets, highlighting increased institutional confidence in regulated crypto products. Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s proposed Bitcoin trust will hold Bitcoin directly, not through derivatives, with daily net asset value (NAV) calculated from major spot exchanges. Structured as a passive fund, it won’t trade based on short-term price movements. The banking giant has also filed for a Solana (SOL) trust. The fund’s shares will be issued and redeemed in large blocks by authorized participants, using cash or in-kind transactions facilitated via third-party Bitcoin counterparties. Retail investors can trade shares on the secondary market through regular brokerage accounts, providing regulated, direct exposure to Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley’s filing follows a surge in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold $123B, about 6.57% of Bitcoin’s market cap. With over $1.1B in net inflows this year, investor demand for regulated, exchange-traded crypto exposure is clearly rising. Well, the filings mark Morgan Stanley’s shift from selling third-party crypto products to creating its own, signaling stronger conviction in digital assets and a more active role in the evolving crypto market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s surge to $93,000 underscores its resilience and rising confidence in institutional-grade crypto. With U.S. regulatory clarity improving, Morgan Stanley’s spot Bitcoin ETF could be a key milestone, offering both retail and institutional investors a secure, regulated path to direct Bitcoin exposure. Why does this matter? Well, Morgan Stanley’s move signals a broader shift, showing top financial institutions increasingly see Bitcoin and digital assets as essential to modern investment strategies. Conclusion Morgan Stanley’s spot Bitcoin ETF filing goes beyond product innovation, it marks a clear institutional embrace of digital assets. By shifting from third-party crypto offerings to its own regulated vehicles, the firm signals confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and the maturing crypto market. As investors demand secure, transparent, exchange-traded access to Bitcoin, Morgan Stanley positions itself at the forefront of mainstream adoption, underscoring the growing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The proposed product, named the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust, would track the price of bitcoin directly, marking a shift from distributing third-party crypto products to building in-house vehicles. Morgan Stanley Targets Simple, Price-Tracking Bitcoin ETF The filing shows that the trust is structured as a passive ETF designed to mirror Bitcoin’s price performance in U.S. dollars, minus fees and expenses. It will hold bitcoin directly rather than using leverage, derivatives, or active trading strategies. Source: SEC Net asset value will be calculated daily using a pricing benchmark derived from aggregated activity across major spot bitcoin exchanges. Shares are expected to list on a national securities exchange under a ticker that has not yet been disclosed, subject to SEC approval. Morgan Stanley Investment Management will sponsor the trust, while custody and operational oversight will be handled by designated service providers. Shares will be created and redeemed only in large blocks by authorized participants, either in cash or in kind. For cash creations and redemptions, third-party bitcoin counterparties will execute trades on behalf of the trust, with trading costs borne by the authorized participants. Retail investors will not be able to redeem shares directly and will instead trade them on the secondary market through brokerage accounts, where prices may deviate slightly from net asset value depending on market conditions. The filing comes as spot bitcoin ETFs continue to expand rapidly in the U.S. market. Data shows these products now hold more than $123 billion in net assets, representing about 6.6% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Total net assets held by Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Source: Sosovalue Net inflows have exceeded $1.1 billion since the start of the year, with Bitcoin trading near $93,800 as of Jan. 5. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF has emerged as one of the firm’s largest revenue drivers, with allocations nearing $100 billion, showing the fee potential of these products. @BlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025. #ETF #Bitcoin https://t.co/k1zRml0omY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 Morgan Stanley Pushes Crypto Further Into Mainstream Portfolios Morgan Stanley’s move also follows its filing for a Solana-tracking trust, showing a broader push into crypto-linked investment vehicles. Solana trusts have already grown past $1 billion in total net assets after attracting nearly $800 million in cumulative inflows. Total net assets of Solana Trust Source: Sosovalue Together, the filings point to a strategy aimed at capturing more of the economics of crypto investing rather than outsourcing exposure to competitors. Unlike asset managers that focus primarily on fund distribution, Morgan Stanley operates the world’s largest wealth management business, overseeing roughly $8.2 trillion in client assets. The timing of the S-1 filing aligns with a broader regulatory and commercial shift. Morgan Stanley is also preparing to roll out direct crypto trading for Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana through its E-Trade platform, pending regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve. American investment bank @MorganStanley sets sights on crypto trading via E-Trade, banking on potential Trump-era regulatory ease. #MorganStanley #CryptoTrading https://t.co/H7YtyYCJkA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 3, 2025 The bank has cited a more permissive U.S. regulatory stance as a factor behind expanding its digital asset offerings. For investors, the proposed trust would provide regulated bitcoin exposure through familiar brokerage infrastructure, avoiding the operational complexities of self-custody. As with other spot ETFs, the structure is designed to keep share prices closely aligned with the underlying asset through daily creation and redemption mechanisms, addressing issues that plagued earlier trust models that traded at persistent premiums or discounts.

56898480,654305,1767717048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56898480.jpeg,"Ethereum To Hit $15,000 In 2026 As ‘Wall Street’s Default Chain’: Vivek Raman",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-15000-in-2026-wall-street-raman/,bitcoinist,"Ethereum could reprice to $15,000 in 2026 as traditional finance accelerates into tokenization, stablecoins, and bespoke Layer 2 blockchains built on Ethereum, according to Vivek Raman, CEO and co-founder of Etherealize. In a Jan. 5 guest post , Raman framed 2026 as the point where ETH shifts from a decade-long credibility build to a commercial deployment era, arguing that “from 2026 onward – Ethereum will become the best place to do business,” as regulatory posture, institutional precedent, and infrastructure maturity converge. Institutions Will Tokenize On Ethereum Raman’s core claim is that tokenization is moving from proof-of-concept into scaled product deployment, with Ethereum increasingly serving as the base layer institutions choose when the assets are high value and the operational requirements are strict. He describes tokenization as a business-process upgrade that collapses assets, data, and payments onto shared infrastructure, and he leaned heavily on the idea that once institutions experience the efficiencies, they will not revert. “Tokenization upgrades entire business processes by digitizing assets, data, and payments onto the same infrastructure,” Raman wrote. “Assets (like stocks, bonds, real estate) and money will be able to move at the speed of the Internet. This is an obvious upgrade to the financial system that should have happened decades ago; public global blockchains like Ethereum enable this today.” The post cites examples of institutional tokenization activity on Ethereum, including money market fund initiatives from JPMorgan and Fidelity, BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL , Apollo’s private credit fund ACRED (with liquidity concentrated on Ethereum and its L2s), and European participation such as Amundi tokenizing a euro-denominated money market fund. Raman also pointed to tokenized products from BNY Mellon and a planned tokenized bond fund tied to Baillie Gifford that would span Ethereum and an L2 network. Stablecoins As The “Green Light” Moment Raman positioned stablecoins as the clearest product-market fit for onchain finance, citing “$10T+ in stablecoin transfer volumes in 2025” and claiming that “60% of all stablecoins are on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks.” He argued that regulatory developments in the US have de-risked deployment for institutions, describing the passage of the GENIUS Act in 2025 as the moment public-chain stablecoin rails effectively received formal clearance. As a near-term datapoint, Raman highlighted SoFi’s reported launch of a bank-issued stablecoin, SoFiUSD, on a “public, permissionless blockchain,” adding that the bank chose Ethereum. He suggested this is the start of a broader wave where investment banks, neobanks, and fintechs explore stablecoin issuance—either solo or via consortium structures—inside a single public-chain ecosystem to maximize network effects. Layer 2s As The Institutional Business Model A major part of Raman’s thesis hinges on the idea that institutions will not converge on a single chain, but will converge on a single interconnected network, Ethereum plus its Layer 2 ecosystem. He argued that L2s provide customization by jurisdiction and customer base while inheriting Ethereum’s security and liquidity, and he described L2 economics as unusually attractive for operators, citing “90+% profit margins” as a reason businesses will want their own chains. Raman listed examples including Coinbase’s Base, Robinhood’s plans for an Ethereum L2 featuring tokenized stocks and other assets, SWIFT’s use of the Ethereum L2 Linea for settlements, JPMorgan deploying tokenized deposits on Base, and Deutsche Bank building a public, permissioned network as an Ethereum L2. The $15,000 Ethereum Price Target Raman also argued ETH is emerging as an institutional treasury asset alongside bitcoin, describing BTC as “digital gold” and ETH as “digital oil”, a productive store of value tied to ecosystem economic activity. He pointed to four public-company “MicroStrategy-equivalents” accumulating ETH: BitMine Immersion (BMNR), Sharplink Gaming (SBET), The Ether Machine (ETHM), and Bit Digital (BTBT) and claimed they have collectively purchased roughly 4.5% of ETH supply in the last six months, comparing that to MicroStrategy’s 3.2% of BTC ownership. Those dynamics underpin his 2026 “5x” forecast set: tokenized assets rising to nearly $100 billion (from an estimated $18 billion after growing from ~$6 billion in 2025, with “66%…on Ethereum and its L2s”), stablecoin market cap expanding to $1.5 trillion (from $308 billion), and ETH appreciating 5x to $15,000—an implied $2 trillion market cap in his framing.

According to Deadline, an analyst’s analysis shows the move reflects a confirmed breakout on the daily chart, ending a prolonged corrective phase. Breakout Confirms Trend Shift Above Key Resistance Significantly, Solana reclaimed the $140 level after weeks of sideways trading near cycle lows. Analysis cited by Deadline report that price action broke a descending trendline, which previously capped upside attempts. Hence, buyers now appear to control the short-term structure. The next technical objective sits near $170, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Additionally, analysts view $200 as a major psychological barrier if momentum holds. Beyond that level, extension models project a potential move toward $260 under strong market conditions. However, analysts stress that continuation depends on sustained demand and broader crypto market stability. Source: CoinCodex According to CoinCodex data as of press time, Solana traded around $139, posting a 4.09% daily gain. Moreover, the token recorded above 12% increase over the past week. With roughly 560 million SOL in circulation, its market capitalization now stands near $78 billion. ETF Inflows Strengthen Institutional Narrative Besides technical strength, institutional activity continues to support Solana’s outlook. Data from Coinglass showed steady net inflows into Solana spot ETFs on January 5. Total inflows reached 125.33K SOL, reflecting sustained interest from asset managers. Bitwise led flows with 93.25K SOL, followed by Fidelity at 14.92K SOL. Grayscale added 13.43K SOL, while VanEck contributed 3.73K SOL. Consequently, analysts argue that ETF demand reinforces the breakout’s credibility. Morgan Stanley Filing Adds Long-Term Catalyst Additionally, regulatory filings introduced a longer-term catalyst for Solana. Morgan Stanley submitted an S-1 registration to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a Solana Trust.

56898765,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259062,1767717611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets: BTC Falls Below $93,000 Amidst Market Uncertainty",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-93000-4/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets: BTC Falls Below $93,000 Amidst Market Uncertainty Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant correction on March 15, 2025, as the flagship digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC), broke below the critical $93,000 psychological support level. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $92,997.34 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price movement represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and prompts a deeper analysis of underlying market forces, historical context, and potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Market analysts are now scrutinizing trading volumes, derivative market metrics, and macroeconomic indicators to understand the drivers behind this sudden Bitcoin price decline. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Support Level The descent of the Bitcoin price below $93,000 marks a pivotal moment for traders and long-term holders alike. This level had previously acted as a consolidation zone following the asset’s ascent past the $90,000 milestone earlier in the year. Consequently, the breach signals potential weakness in the current market structure. Trading volume data from major exchanges shows a 35% increase during the sell-off, indicating heightened participation. Furthermore, the move triggered approximately $240 million in long position liquidations across derivatives platforms within a 24-hour window. This liquidation cascade often exacerbates short-term price movements, creating a feedback loop of selling pressure. Historical data provides crucial context for this event. For instance, similar breakdowns from key psychological levels in 2023 and 2024 were followed by periods of increased volatility. However, they did not necessarily invalidate longer-term bullish trends. The current global macroeconomic landscape, characterized by shifting interest rate expectations and geopolitical tensions, adds another layer of complexity. Market participants are therefore comparing this dip to previous cycles to gauge potential recovery timelines and identify new support zones. Technical analysts are now watching the $90,000 and $88,500 levels as the next potential areas where buying interest may resurface. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Market Context The movement in the Bitcoin price does not occur in isolation. The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization has contracted by 4.2% over the same period. Major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), have experienced correlated declines, typically ranging from 5% to 8%. This correlation underscores Bitcoin’s continued role as the market leader and primary sentiment indicator. Meanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has seen a marginal decrease, suggesting some capital is moving to the sidelines. On-chain metrics reveal nuanced behavior among different holder cohorts. Exchange Flows: Net inflows to centralized exchanges spiked by 120%, often a precursor to selling activity. Holder Behavior: Addresses classified as “long-term holders” (holding for >155 days) show minimal movement, suggesting conviction remains among core investors. Miner Activity: Bitcoin miner reserves have remained stable, indicating no major distress selling from this key cohort. These mixed signals create a complex picture for analysts. The sell-off appears driven primarily by short-term traders and leveraged positions, rather than a fundamental exodus of long-term capital. Regulatory news flow has been relatively quiet, pointing to technical and macro-driven factors as the primary catalysts. The strength of the US Dollar Index (DXY) and movements in traditional equity markets are also being closely monitored for their inverse relationship with crypto asset performance. Expert Perspectives on Market Volatility Financial analysts and seasoned cryptocurrency researchers emphasize the normality of such corrections in a maturing yet volatile asset class. Dr. Anya Petrova, a lead market strategist at Digital Asset Research, notes, “A 3-5% daily move, while attention-grabbing, is within the standard deviation for Bitcoin’s historical volatility. The key metrics to watch are funding rates in perpetual swap markets and the stability of the spot premium on regulated exchanges. Currently, these suggest a healthy reset, not a trend reversal.” Her analysis is backed by data showing normalized funding rates after the initial liquidation wave. Furthermore, institutional on-chain data providers report that large-scale entities have used the dip to accumulate Bitcoin at a measured pace. This activity often provides a floor during corrections. The table below summarizes key market data points before and after the move below $93,000: Metric Pre-Dip (24h Prior) Post-Dip (Current) Change BTC Price (Binance) $94,850 $92,997.34 -1.95% 24h Trading Volume $32.1B $43.4B +35.2% Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) 52 (Neutral) -22 points Open Interest (Aggregate) $38.5B $36.2B -6.0% This data illustrates a market cooling from overheated conditions. The reset in the Fear & Greed Index from “Greed” to “Neutral” is viewed by many analysts as a positive development for sustainable price discovery. It reduces the risk of a speculative bubble forming at higher price levels. The decrease in aggregate open interest, while prices fell, indicates a reduction in leveraged speculation, which can lead to a more stable foundation for the next price move. Historical Precedents and Future Trajectories Examining past Bitcoin price behavior reveals patterns that can inform current expectations. In the 2021 cycle, a 20-30% correction was common during the bull market’s mid-phase. These pullbacks served to shake out weak hands and transfer assets to stronger holders. The current decline, at roughly 7% from the recent local high, remains shallow by historical standards if the broader trend remains intact. Key support levels from previous cycles, such as the 20-week and 50-week moving averages, are still positioned significantly below the current price, acting as potential magnets in a deeper correction but also as robust long-term support. The fundamental thesis for Bitcoin remains unchanged for many institutional investors. The upcoming halving event in April 2024 has already passed, reducing the new supply issuance. Network security, measured by hash rate, continues to hit all-time highs, signaling robust underlying infrastructure. Adoption metrics, including active addresses and settlement volume, show steady growth. Therefore, while short-term price action is dominated by trader sentiment and liquidity flows, the long-term narrative built on scarcity, security, and adoption appears undisturbed. Market technicians are now modeling scenarios where Bitcoin finds support and resumes its uptrend, versus scenarios where a deeper correction towards the $80,000 range unfolds. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $93,000 serves as a stark reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility, even as it matures within the global financial system. This move, while significant, is contextualized by historical patterns, healthy derivative market resets, and stable long-term holder behavior. The key focus for market participants now shifts to identifying where new support will establish itself and whether macroeconomic headwinds will persist. For investors, such events underscore the importance of risk management, portfolio diversification, and a focus on multi-timeframe analysis rather than reactive trading. The fundamental drivers of the Bitcoin network—decentralization, predictable monetary policy, and censorship resistance—remain intact, suggesting this price action may represent a temporary recalibration rather than a fundamental shift. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $93,000? The decline appears driven by a combination of technical selling after failing to hold support, a wave of long position liquidations in derivatives markets, and a broader risk-off sentiment affecting global assets. Increased selling volume on exchanges accelerated the move. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, volatility and corrections of 5-10% are statistically normal within Bitcoin bull markets. Historical data shows similar or larger pullbacks have occurred regularly, often serving to reset over-leveraged markets before continuing the primary trend. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Analysts are monitoring the $90,000 psychological level, followed by the $88,500 zone, which aligns with a previous consolidation area. The 50-day moving average, currently near $87,200, is also a widely watched technical indicator. Q4: How are long-term Bitcoin holders reacting? On-chain data indicates minimal movement from addresses holding Bitcoin for more than 155 days (long-term holders). Their reserves have remained stable, suggesting this cohort is not participating in the panic selling and views the dip as a short-term event. Q5: Does this price drop affect the overall cryptocurrency market outlook? While Bitcoin’s price action heavily influences short-term sentiment across the crypto market, the long-term outlook depends on broader adoption, regulatory developments, and technological progress. Many analysts view healthy corrections as necessary for sustainable long-term growth, as they reduce speculative excess.

David Duong, Global Head of Investment Research at Coinbase, said in a recent post that Bitcoin may be entering a “new regime” as quantum computing advances, even if the threat is not immediate. Duong pointed to growing institutional awareness of the issue, including BlackRock’s decision to flag quantum risks in the amended prospectus for its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in May 2025 and guidance from U.S. and EU authorities urging critical infrastructure to migrate to post-quantum cryptography by 2035. Why Researchers Say a Third of Bitcoin Could Face Quantum Risk At the center of the concern is what researchers often call “Q-day,” the point at which cryptographically relevant quantum computers become powerful enough to undermine today’s public-key systems. Bitcoin relies on elliptic curve cryptography to secure wallets and on SHA-256 for mining . Duong said quantum machines capable of running Shor’s algorithm could theoretically derive private keys from exposed public keys, allowing attackers to steal funds, while Grover’s algorithm could eventually make mining more efficient. For now, signature security is viewed as the more urgent issue. Based on on-chain data through block 900,000, Duong estimated that about 6.51 million BTC, or roughly 32.7% of the total supply, sits in address types that are more vulnerable to long-range quantum attacks. Source: David Duong These include legacy Pay-to-Public-Key outputs, bare multisig scripts, and some Taproot constructions where public keys are already visible on-chain. Satoshi-era coins are a well-known subset of this category. In addition, Duong noted that every Bitcoin transaction briefly exposes a public key at the moment of spending, creating a short-range attack window if a sufficiently advanced quantum computer were ever available. The warning builds on a broader industry debate that has intensified over the past year. On-chain analysts have highlighted that a large share of Bitcoin has remained dormant for long periods , with data showing more than 30% of supply unmoved for at least five years. Analysts warn that #BTC quantum risk is political, and dormant $BTC on old addresses could be exposed to future attacks. #Bitcoin #QuantumComputing https://t.co/AYI0pMoZpW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Some researchers argue that those coins would be the first targets if quantum attacks became feasible, while others say the larger challenge would be coordinating how the network responds. Bitcoin’s Quantum Debate Moves From Theory to Planning Not everyone agrees on the urgency, as in December, Blockstream CEO Adam Back pushed back against claims that Bitcoin faces an imminent quantum crisis, saying developers are already working quietly on long-term protections without inflaming markets. @Blockstream CEO @adam3us has publicly pushed back against claims that Bitcoin faces an imminent threat from quantum computing. #Bitcoin #Quantum https://t.co/8Xsi3zt95n — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2025 Venture investor Nic Carter disagreed, arguing that too many in the ecosystem remain in denial and pointing to government preparations and rising investment in quantum firms as signs the risk deserves more attention. The divide extends to timelines, with Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards warning that quantum threats could materialize within a decade without upgrades, while others place the risk further out. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has taken a more optimistic view, saying that a quantum breakthrough would ultimately “harden” Bitcoin as active coins migrate to new standards and inaccessible coins remain frozen, reducing effective supply. Despite differing opinions, preparations are underway. Bitcoin developers have discussed post-quantum signature schemes, and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology finalized several quantum-resistant standards in 2024. Implementing them on Bitcoin would require broad consensus and likely a hard fork, a process complicated by inactive wallets and the network’s decentralized governance. Researchers continue to warn that adversaries may already be collecting blockchain data today in anticipation of future breakthroughs.

56899399,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=872509,1767718803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56899399.jpeg,"Bitcoin Wins As Trump Pumps GDP, Suppresses Oil: Arthur Hayes",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-wins-trump-pumps-gdp-suppresses-oil-hayes/,newsbtc,"Arthur Hayes argues that the US move to seize control of Venezuelan oil is less about geopolitics than electoral math and that the resulting policy mix of hotter nominal growth and capped energy costs is structurally bullish for Bitcoin and high-beta crypto. In a Jan. 6 essay titled “Suavemente,” the BitMEX co-founder frames the current moment through a deliberately simple lens: US politicians optimize for re-election, and the median voter optimizes for perceived economic wellbeing. “The question is, does the American colonization of Venezuela make Bitcoin/crypto number go up or down?” Hayes writes. Hayes’ core claim is that US political control is decided at the margins, and those margins respond overwhelmingly to the economy and inflation, particularly “food and energy” inflation. “Above all else… the only issue that the median voter cares about is the economy,” he writes. “It is easy to pump the economy, and by that, I mean nominal GDP. That is just a question of how much credit Trump can create.” Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows But Hayes insists the same playbook can backfire if inflation follows, especially at the pump. “The key metric for Americans is the price of gasoline,” he writes, arguing that limited public transportation makes gas prices a daily referendum on economic management. In that framework, Venezuela’s value is straightforward: suppress oil, suppress gasoline, and keep the “run the economy hot” promise intact without triggering voter backlash. He highlights what he calls a “10% rule”: “when the national average price of gasoline rises 10% or more in the three months preceding an election versus the average price in January of the same calendar year, control of one or more branches of government switches teams.” That dynamic, in his telling, creates two regimes that matter for markets: nominal GDP/credit up with oil up, or nominal GDP/credit up with oil flat-to-down. Why Bitcoin “Wins” If Oil Stays Contained Hayes’ bullish conclusion rests on the idea that oil prices constrain the durability of money printing, not the mechanics of Bitcoin itself. “Because of the energy used running computers engaged in proof of work mining, Bitcoin is the purest monetary abstraction there is,” he writes. “Therefore, the price of energy is irrelevant to the price of Bitcoin as all miners will face a parallel shift up or down in the price at the same time. The price of oil only matters regarding its ability to force politicians to stop printing money.” Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 In his setup, the stress signals are macro-market ones: the 10-year Treasury yield and the MOVE Index, a measure of bond-market volatility. He argues that when oil rises far enough to push yields “close to 5%,” volatility spikes, leverage unwinds, and policymakers are pressured into a pivot. Hayes points to a prior episode as a template for reflexivity: “If you remember, Trump threatened tariffs so high… markets tanked, and the MOVE Index spiked to an intraday high of 172. The next day after the spike, Trump… ‘paused’ the tariffs, and markets bottomed then recovered violently.” Absent that stress, Hayes’ base case is aggressive credit expansion with oil “subsided if not outright fall,” which he ties directly to Bitcoin upside. He cites his “USD Liquidity Conditions Index” as evidence that Bitcoin’s trend tracks dollar liquidity, concluding: “As the amount of dollars expands, the price of Bitcoin and certain cryptos will sky rocket.” The essay also reads like a positioning memo. Hayes says his fund, Maelstrom, entered 2026 with “almost maximum risk,” low dollar-stable exposure, and an intention to rotate: “To obtain outperformance versus BTC and ETH, I will sell BTC to fund privacy positions and sell ETH to fund DeFi.” He names Zcash (ZEC) as the “privacy beta,” saying the fund is “already long a fuck ton of that” from 3Q25. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $93,841.

56899474,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=31540,1767719009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,"Trading Spaces Recap: New year, new volatility? Dentoshi breaks down BTC, ETH and early signs of life in altcoins",https://blog.kraken.com/crypto-education/dentoshi-new-year-new-volatility,krakenblog,"After a quiet and frustrating end to 2025, the crypto market entered the new year with something traders had been missing for weeks: movement. In the first Trading Spaces of 2026, Kraken VP of Growth Matt Howells-Barby sat down with Pro trader Dentoshi to assess whether early January price action is just another false start – or the beginning of a more tradable environment. With Bitcoin attempting to reclaim key levels, ether already showing relative strength and altcoins breaking long-standing downtrends, the conversation focused less on macro and more on what the charts are actually doing. As always, this discussion is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Bitcoin: A new yearly open, but conviction still needed The session opened with bitcoin, where Dentoshi emphasized the importance of the new yearly open as a fresh benchmark for traders. After weeks of extremely low volatility and repeated rejections near the same levels, BTC has spent much of the past month locked in a narrow range. Dentoshi noted that prolonged compression often precedes expansion – but direction matters more than speed. “We’ve been sitting here for so long. When the move comes, whether it’s up or down, it’s one you should actually believe.” While BTC has yet to convincingly reclaim its key moving averages, Dentoshi highlighted that early signs are beginning to appear on lower timeframes. A sustained reclaim of the 2025 yearly open, combined with bullish EMA structure, could open the door to a push toward the next major resistance zone. Conversely, failure at current levels would likely lead to a sweep of recent lows and potentially better entries. The takeaway: volatility is likely coming – but bitcoin still needs confirmation before traders can assume follow-through. Ether leads the majors as momentum builds Where bitcoin remains undecided, ether is already doing what BTC has not. Dentoshi pointed out that ETH is breaking back above key EMAs and might be beginning to flip them into support , a structural shift traders have been waiting for since late 2025. While nearby resistance remains a risk, ether’s relative strength stands out – particularly given how many altcoins historically depend on ETH’s health to sustain upside momentum. “ETH is already performing what we want to see on BTC. That gives it more strength – and that’s a good sign for alts as well.” Matt added that broader sentiment around ether in 2026 appears noticeably more constructive than for other majors. While long-term projections should always be treated cautiously, belief matters – and markets tend to reward rallies people are willing to buy. For now, Dentoshi stressed a level-by-level approach , watching whether ETH can reclaim its nearby resistance cleanly rather than assuming an immediate move higher. Altcoins: From total apathy to early structure shifts One of the most notable shifts in this session was the sheer number of altcoin charts beginning to look similar. After nearly three months of persistent downside following the October 10 selloff, Dentoshi highlighted that many alts are now attempting to reclaim long-held downtrends. This includes both memes and non-memes, an important distinction. “This strength isn’t meme-isolated. A lot of coins are doing the same thing structurally.”Examples discussed included PEPE , which has been one of the strongest movers off the lows, as well as ENA , PENGU and other assets retracing from deeply oversold conditions into major EMA clusters. The “gap fill” setup Dentoshi is watching closely A key educational moment in the stream came when Dentoshi explained a concept she frequently uses: the EMA gap fill . When an asset reclaims a longer-term downtrend, price often travels from one EMA to the next, “filling” the gap between them. These setups can occur on multiple timeframes and, when aligned with support/resistance and broader market strength, offer high-probability trades. “When an asset reclaims a trend that’s been pushing it down, it often trades to the next EMA and fills the gap.” Dentoshi noted that many altcoins are now entering exactly this phase, with price reclaiming daily trend EMAs and potentially targeting higher moving averages if conditions remain supportive. The caveat: these setups only work if the broader market stays constructive – and sharp rejections would invalidate the thesis quickly. Zcash: An outlier chart that still raises questions Zcash (ZEC) remains one of the more confusing charts in the market. While it showed unusual strength post-October – even pushing to yearly highs when most assets were collapsing – recent price action has diverged from the rest of the altcoin complex. As ETH and others attempt to reclaim trends, ZEC has weakened at critical levels. “You really don’t want to see this much weakness when the rest of the market is moving.” Dentoshi explained that ZEC is now at a decisive inflection point. Holding current support could allow the structure to stabilize, but failure would likely confirm a broader trend reversal – and potentially mark the end of its relative outperformance. Both speakers cautioned against emotional attachment to prior winners, emphasizing the risk of “round-tripping” profits by forcing trades on charts that no longer behave cleanly. Weak charts improving is a healthy sign Interestingly, some of the weakest charts from late 2025 are now beginning to reclaim structure as well. Dentoshi pointed to examples like XRP-adjacent plays and newly listed assets such as MONAD , where logical breakouts, retests and diagonal structures are finally starting to hold. “A tradable market is one where logical levels actually matter again.” This shift – from random level-blasting to technically respectful price action – could signal a gradual transition back to an environment where traders can operate with more confidence. DOGE confirms the broader theme To round out the altcoin discussion, Matt pulled up Dogecoin – and the result reinforced the broader takeaway. DOGE is also breaking out of a long-standing downtrend, reclaiming structure that has capped price for months. While still early, the consistency across charts suggests this is not isolated speculation, but a coordinated shift in market behavior. “They’re all doing the same thing. After a long downtrend, these gap-fill environments show up again and again, and they are usually profitable strategies.” What to watch next As the session wrapped up, both speakers agreed that the next few days will be critical. With BTC and ETH pushing into key resistance zones and global markets reopening, sustainability will matter more than the initial move. Dentoshi’s checklist for traders: Identify assets that retraced to logical, significant lows Watch for EMA reclaims across multiple timeframes after a move off those lows Be aware of token unlocks and catalysts Let BTC and ETH confirm strength before assuming continuation After months of chop, the market is finally offering something new: opportunity – with conditions.

Data from multiple sources, including SoSoValue , confirms that this is the largest single-day inflow since October 7, 2025, indicating a decisive return of institutional appetite after a stagnant final quarter. According to SoSoValue, on Jan. 5 (ET), U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded total net inflows of $697 million. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT saw the largest single-day net inflow at $372 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs posted total net inflows of $168 million, Solana spot ETFs… pic.twitter.com/R71kynCXRH — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 6, 2026 Bitcoin Breaks Out as ETF Demand Jumps The demand surge coincided with a sharp move in the underlying asset, with Bitcoin (BTC) pushing past $93,000 and trading as high as $94,745. The move reverses a period of muted flows and net withdrawals seen in late December. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack, pulling in $372 million, more than half of the day’s total. Fidelity’s FBTC was a distant second, securing $191 million in new assets. The buying was broad-based, with nine separate Bitcoin ETF products posting positive inflows, including strong demand for funds from Bitwise, Ark, and Invesco. The rally was not isolated to Bitcoin. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw a substantial rebound, adding over $168 million in net new assets on the same day. This parallel demand for the top two crypto assets points toward a wider risk-on sentiment across the digital asset class to start the year. What the Flows Suggest This is not a random daily fluctuation. The January 5th inflow represents a clear sign of institutional re-risking and new year portfolio rebalancing. After a period of tax-loss harvesting and general de-risking into the end of 2025, asset managers are now redeploying capital. The fact that BlackRock’s IBIT captured over 50% of the flow reinforces its position as the primary gateway for large, traditional allocators. The synchronized buying in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that committee-driven decisions are being made to increase exposure to the entire asset class, not just a flight-to-safety into Bitcoin alone.

Executive Order 14233 , signed March 6, 2025, explicitly mandates that Bitcoin acquired via criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings “ shall not be sold ” and must be transferred to the United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to an Asset Liquidation Agreement obtained exclusively by Bitcoin Magazine , prosecutors directed the U.S. Marshals Service to sell $6.3 million worth of Bitcoin that Samourai developers Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill paid as part of their guilty plea. Source: Bitcoin Magazine The Bitcoin was sent directly to Coinbase Prime address 3Lz5ULL7nG7vv6nwc8kNnbjDmSnawKS3n8 , which currently shows a zero balance, indicating the assets may have already been liquidated. Defying Federal Guidance on Multiple Fronts This marks the second instance in which the Southern District of New York has acted against federal directives in the Samourai case. On April 7, 2025, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a memo titled “ Ending Regulation By Prosecution ,” stating “t he Department [of Justice] will no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users. “ Despite this clear guidance, SDNY prosecutors proceeded with cases against Rodriguez, Hill, and Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm . The prosecution also moved forward after learning, through a Brady request, that two high-ranking FinCEN officials “ strongly suggested ” that Samourai Wallet wasn’t operating as a money transmitter because of its non-custodial nature. The SDNY has earned its colloquial nickname “ Sovereign District of New York ” for operating independently within the federal system, boasting conviction rates exceeding 90% and a reputation for harsh sentencing. Amongst many others, Senator Cynthia Lummis has particularly criticized this move, saying the United States “ can’t afford to squander these strategic assets while other nations are accumulating bitcoin. ” “ I’m deeply concerned about this report ,” she added. Why is the U.S. gov still liquidating bitcoin when @POTUS explicitly directed these assets be preserved for our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? We can’t afford to squander these strategic assets while other nations are accumulating bitcoin. I’m deeply concerned about this report. https://t.co/XW5WxsfliA — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 6, 2026 Legal Framework and Presidential Intent Trump’s executive order established two distinct entities: The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for forfeited Bitcoin. The United States Digital Asset Stockpile for other cryptocurrencies. The order explicitly states that “ Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. “ According to legal analysis, the forfeited Bitcoin falls under 18 U.S. Code § 982(a)(1), which governs property involved in unlicensed money transmitting offenses. Neither this statute nor the incorporated § 853 requires liquidation of forfeited property. The executive order only permits disposal of digital assets in specific scenarios, such as returning funds to crime victims, law enforcement operations, sharing with state partners, or satisfying specific statutory requirements, none of which apply to the Rodriguez and Hill cases. Back in April 2025, White House crypto adviser Bo Hines emphasized that any Bitcoin accumulation strategy must be “budget neutral,” and the administration wasexploring creative approaches, including tariff revenue and revaluing gold reserves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also clarified in August that the country is “ not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up. “ Questions About Ending the War on Crypto Rodriguez received a five-year sentence on November 6 , while Hill was sentenced to four years on November 19 for operating Samourai Wallet, which prosecutors claimed processed over $237 million in criminal proceeds. Both developers forfeited the $6.3 million in fees earned from their platform’s operations. On December 16, President Trump indicated he would consider pardoning Rodriguez after being asked about the case during an Oval Office event. “ I’ve heard about it, I’ll look at it ,” Trump told reporters , directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to examine the matter. Rodriguez responded on social media, stating, “ this President knows all about lawfare. He knows all about a weaponized Biden DOJ hunting down their political rivals. “ I have always said that the most challenging aspect of getting a pardon for me and Bill would be getting the attention of @realDonaldTrump . He is very busy with many people competing for his attention. Today, thanks to the journalist at Decrypt, the President is aware of our… https://t.co/lmYljfFax9 — Keonne Rodriguez (@keonne) December 15, 2025 Trump has previously pardoned Ross Ulbricht and Changpeng Zhao in related crypto cases, and has raised optimism of a similar pardon for Rodriguez. The liquidation contradicts the administration’s stated goal of treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset on par with gold reserves. As a result, Patrick Witt, Executive Director of the White House President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, said on X that the council is looking into the matter.

A multi-year case around Bitcoin ATMs The settlement brings an end to a two-year-long case that was filed in 2023. State regulators alleged that several kiosks operated by Bitcoin Depot across Maine were becoming “instrumentalities of massive fraud” by facilitating third-party scams that specifically targeted vulnerable consumers, often the elderly. Bitcoin Depot denied any wrongdoing and has argued in court that it employs prominent on-screen warnings and fraud alerts. However, prosecutors argued that the company intentionally failed to implement fraud-prevention safeguards despite being aware of the criminal activities and the significant income derived from them. Further, the state alleged that Bitcoin Depot misled consumers by not clearly disclosing high transaction fees and inflated exchange rates, which often led to users incurring deductions as high as 23%. In response, prosecutors sought a $1.9 million financial penalty, which will be placed into a fund managed by the Maine Attorney General to compensate victims defrauded between 2022 and 2025. As a part of the deal, the ATM operator would also have to comply with new consumer protection standards, including rules regarding “unhosted wallets” that make it harder for scammers to take control of a victim’s funds during a transaction. However, the agreement has also brought with it a regulatory concession in the form of a money transmitter license. This license will now allow Bitcoin Depot to legally operate in the state, even though details from the company’s website suggest the state is yet to be listed among its active locations . Regulators in Maine have had to take increasingly aggressive measures to mitigate damages caused by third-party scams, where fraudsters, often impersonating tech support or government officials, coerced victims into using kiosks to convert cash into cryptocurrency. By 2024, these scams had caused significant financial harm to Maine residents, including a senior citizen who lost funds at an Old Orchard Beach kiosk. In response, Governor Janet Mills signed emergency legislation dubbed the Act to Regulate Virtual Currency Kiosks in June 2025, which established strict daily transaction limits and fee caps to deter scammers. “I am grateful that our Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection secured this agreement that will put money back into the pockets of Maine people who were defrauded by predatory third-party scammers,” Governor Janet Mills said in a recent statement regarding the settlement. Crypto ATM scams remain a problem Across the globe, crypto ATMs have drawn a lot of heat for the same reason. In many jurisdictions, there are even stricter laws in place, including tighter fee disclosures, user verification rules, and mandatory transaction limits. Meanwhile, some countries like New Zealand and the Philippines have placed outright bans on ATMs, while others are formulating regulatory frameworks to govern these machines. Nevertheless, bad actors have continued to target unsuspecting users, and the latest data from the FBI claims that scammers defrauded Americans of more than $333 million through dubious schemes involving crypto ATMs between January and November 2025.

Sui (SUI) has witnessed an even more impressive increase, with its price surging by almost 20% over the past 24 hours. Numerous analysts now believe it could be on the verge of a major bull run that might result in a new all-time high. The Next Targets SUI’s price currently trades just below $2, the highest level since mid-November. Its market capitalization soared above $7.5 billion, making it the 27th-largest digital asset, bigger than Litecoin (LTC), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and other popular altcoins. X user Crypto Winkle noted SUI’s recent uptrend, arguing the price has initiated a “clean break” above $1.80 with “strong structure.” The analyst also claimed that on-chain activity has substantially increased since late November, usage has been growing, whereas the ETF filings “add institutional context, not just hype.” “As long as Sui Network holds above [the] prior value, the trend stays constructive. Acceptance above $2.00 opens the next leg,” they predicted. X users Crypto Catalysts and MOON JEFF gave their two cents, too. The former set the ambitious target of at least $8 in the coming weeks, whereas the latter described SUI as “underrated” and said he won’t be surprised if its market capitalization explodes to $30 billion “in a good altseason.” Lucky, who has almost 2 million followers on X, is also bullish. At the start of 2026, the analyst suggested SUI might be gearing up for a positive first quarter, envisioning a rise to approximately $4.44. High-Risk Area? While most analysts who have touched on SUI forecast further gains in the short term, some think an impending correction could also be an option. X user Chill Trader claimed the asset currently represents a “high-risk area,” arguing that a pullback won’t be surprising. SUI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) should also serve as a warning to investors. Traders use the technical analysis tool to spot possible trend reversals, as it indicates when the token is overbought or oversold. It ranges from 0 to 100, and anything above 70 suggests the price has increased too much in a short period and could be due for a plunge. On the other hand, ratios below 30 are considered buying opportunities. Just recently, SUI’s RSI climbed to 87, the highest point witnessed since July last year.

These innovative MarketVector indexes track the rapidly growing stablecoin and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sectors, providing a crucial, measurable framework for institutional participation. Furthermore, asset manager Amplify has immediately launched corresponding exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the NYSE Arca, offering investors a novel, regulated pathway to gain exposure to the foundational infrastructure of blockchain-based finance. This development, reported by Cointelegraph in March 2025, marks a maturation point for crypto-native financial products entering the mainstream investment landscape. MarketVector Indexes Decode Complex Crypto Sectors MarketVector designed these new indexes to solve a persistent challenge for traditional investors: how to gain measured, diversified exposure to specific blockchain innovation themes without direct cryptocurrency ownership. Consequently, the indexes target companies building the critical plumbing for the next generation of financial systems. The MarketVector Stablecoin Index tracks firms involved in stablecoin issuance, payments, and settlement infrastructure. This includes companies like Circle (issuer of USDC), payment processors integrating stablecoins, and technology providers for cross-border settlements. The MarketVector Tokenization Index focuses on the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization ecosystem. It benchmarks companies operating platforms that digitize traditional assets like treasury bonds, real estate, and private equity on blockchains. These MarketVector indexes employ transparent, rules-based methodologies. They select and weight constituents based on factors like revenue exposure, market capitalization, and liquidity. This structured approach provides a clear, replicable benchmark, a necessity for ETF creation and institutional adoption. Amplify ETFs Translate Indexes into Tradable Products Asset manager Amplify Investments swiftly capitalized on the new MarketVector benchmarks by launching two corresponding ETFs. These funds began trading on the NYSE Arca, a premier listing venue for innovative ETFs. ETF Ticker ETF Name Underlying MarketVector Index Investment Focus TKNQ Amplify Tokenization Tech ETF MarketVector Tokenization Index Companies in RWA tokenization platforms and services STBQ Amplify Stablecoin Tech ETF MarketVector Stablecoin Index Companies in stablecoin issuance and payment infrastructure The launch of the Amplify Tokenization Tech ETF (TKNQ) and the Amplify Stablecoin Tech ETF (STBQ) is strategic. It allows financial advisors and retail investors to add these themes to portfolios using familiar brokerage accounts. Moreover, it avoids the complexities of direct crypto custody, regulatory uncertainty, and wallet management. Investors essentially bet on the companies commercializing the technology, not the volatile underlying crypto assets. The Driving Forces Behind Tokenization and Stablecoin Growth The creation of these MarketVector indexes and Amplify ETFs responds to powerful macroeconomic and technological trends. Firstly, real-world asset tokenization is gaining immense traction. Major financial institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton are actively developing blockchain platforms to digitize assets. Tokenization promises increased liquidity, fractional ownership, and automated compliance through smart contracts. Secondly, stablecoins have evolved beyond trading pairs into vital tools for global payments and settlements. Their borderless, near-instant settlement capability presents a compelling alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT, especially for cross-border commerce. Regulatory clarity, particularly the passage of the 2024 Stablecoin Transparency Act in the U.S., has provided a more stable framework for compliant stablecoin operations. This regulatory milestone gave index providers like MarketVector the confidence to create a benchmark around this sector. Similarly, guidance from the SEC regarding digital asset securities has accelerated institutional exploration of tokenization. Therefore, these ETFs arrive at a confluence of technological readiness, market demand, and evolving regulation. Comparative Analysis with Existing Crypto Investment Products These new products differ fundamentally from existing crypto investment vehicles. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, provide direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price. In contrast, the Amplify ETFs offer indirect exposure to the business revenue of companies *servicing* the crypto economy. This is a critical distinction. Risk Profile: TKNQ and STBQ likely exhibit lower volatility than spot crypto ETFs, as they hold equities, not cryptocurrencies. Correlation: Their performance may correlate with both tech equity markets and crypto market sentiment, creating a unique hybrid profile. Regulatory Treatment: They are standard equity ETFs under existing securities laws, simplifying compliance for traditional brokers and institutions. This structure potentially appeals to a broader, more conservative investor base. It also aligns with a growing “picks and shovels” investment philosophy within tech—profiting from the tools enabling a gold rush, not the gold itself. Expert Perspective on Market Infrastructure Development Financial analysts view this launch as a natural progression in the institutionalization of digital assets. “The introduction of sector-specific indexes like these from MarketVector is a hallmark of a maturing asset class,” notes a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. “It allows for precise thematic investing and enables the creation of structured products like ETFs, which are the primary gateway for mainstream capital.” The involvement of VanEck, a long-established asset manager with deep ETF experience, through its MarketVector subsidiary, lends significant credibility. Furthermore, Amplify’s track record in thematic ETFs provides a trusted distribution channel. This collaboration between an index provider, an asset manager, and a major exchange (NYSE Arca) replicates the proven playbook that brought hundreds of traditional sector and thematic ETFs to market over the past two decades. Potential Impact and Future Trajectory The immediate impact of these MarketVector-indexed ETFs is the legitimization and visibility of the stablecoin and tokenization sectors within global finance. They provide a daily, transparent price discovery mechanism for the aggregate value of these business ecosystems. Over the medium term, successful adoption of TKNQ and STBQ could lead to several developments. Increased Capital Inflow: ETF inflows could drive investor attention and capital to the constituent companies. Benchmark for Derivatives: The indexes may underpin futures, options, or other structured products. Sector Proliferation: Success may prompt other index providers and asset managers to launch competing or complementary products, covering niches like decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure or blockchain scalability solutions. However, challenges remain. The performance of these ETFs is tied to public equities, not the direct success of the tokenization or stablecoin protocols. Additionally, regulatory shifts could impact constituent companies differently. Nevertheless, this launch represents a sophisticated next step, moving beyond broad crypto exposure to targeted bets on the specific engines of blockchain’s integration with traditional finance. Conclusion The launch of the MarketVector stablecoin and tokenization indexes, and their immediate embodiment in the Amplify TKNQ and STBQ ETFs, represents a pivotal evolution in digital asset investing. These products provide a crucial, regulated bridge for traditional capital to access the growth of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. By focusing on the companies building the stablecoin payment rails and tokenization platforms, these MarketVector benchmarks offer a nuanced, lower-friction investment thesis. This development signals that the crypto ecosystem is graduating from speculative asset trading to a phase of infrastructure investing, with established financial players like VanEck’s MarketVector and Amplify leading the way in creating the necessary tools for widespread institutional participation. FAQs Q1: What are the new MarketVector indexes tracking? The new MarketVector indexes track two specific sectors: one follows companies involved in stablecoin issuance, payments, and settlement, while the other tracks firms operating real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platforms. Q2: How can I invest in these new MarketVector indexes? You can gain exposure through the Amplify Tokenization Tech ETF (TKNQ) and the Amplify Stablecoin Tech ETF (STBQ), which are exchange-traded funds that track these respective MarketVector indexes and trade on the NYSE Arca. Q3: How is this different from investing in a Bitcoin ETF? Spot Bitcoin ETFs hold Bitcoin directly. These new Amplify ETFs hold shares in public companies that provide services related to stablecoins and tokenization. It’s an investment in the businesses supporting the ecosystem, not the cryptocurrencies themselves. Q4: Why is real-world asset tokenization considered a significant trend? Tokenization can make illiquid assets like real estate or private equity more liquid by representing them as digital tokens on a blockchain. It also allows for fractional ownership, faster settlement, and can reduce administrative costs through automation. Q5: What gives these MarketVector indexes and ETFs credibility? The indexes are provided by MarketVector, a subsidiary of the established global asset manager VanEck. The ETFs are launched by Amplify Investments, an experienced thematic ETF issuer. Their listing on NYSE Arca and use of a transparent, rules-based methodology adds further institutional credibility.

The company strategically liquidated portions of its cryptocurrency reserves to fund ambitious artificial intelligence infrastructure development. This move represents a pivotal moment for both the cryptocurrency mining industry and corporate blockchain strategy. Riot Platforms BTC Sale Details and Transaction Analysis Riot Platforms conducted two major Bitcoin transactions during the final months of 2024. The company sold 383 BTC worth approximately $37 million in November. Subsequently, they executed a larger transaction in December, liquidating 1,818 BTC valued at $161.6 million. These sales reduced Riot’s total Bitcoin holdings from previous levels to 18,005 BTC by year’s end. The timing of these transactions coincided with Bitcoin’s price consolidation period following its 2024 halving event. Market analysts observed that Riot Platforms demonstrated strategic patience by waiting for optimal market conditions. The company’s execution occurred during relatively stable trading periods rather than during volatile market swings. Industry experts immediately noted the significance of these transactions. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at investment management firm VanEck, provided crucial context about the sales. He suggested the proceeds would likely fund Riot Platforms’ artificial intelligence infrastructure expansion. This strategic reallocation represents a calculated diversification beyond pure cryptocurrency mining operations. Bitcoin Mining Industry Context and Comparative Analysis The cryptocurrency mining sector has undergone substantial transformation throughout 2024. Several major mining companies have adjusted their Bitcoin holding strategies in response to market conditions and operational requirements. Riot Platforms’ decision follows broader industry trends while establishing its own distinctive strategic direction. Other mining firms have pursued different approaches to Bitcoin treasury management. Some companies maintain maximum Bitcoin accumulation strategies, while others implement regular selling protocols to fund operations. The table below illustrates recent Bitcoin treasury strategies among major mining companies: Mining Company Bitcoin Holdings Strategy Recent Treasury Actions Riot Platforms Strategic liquidation for AI investment $200M sale in Nov-Dec 2024 Marathon Digital Accumulation with selective selling Minimal recent sales CleanSpark Operational funding through regular sales Monthly selling for expansion Hut 8 Balanced holding and operational selling Mixed strategy implementation Riot Platforms’ approach distinguishes itself through its explicit connection to artificial intelligence infrastructure development. This strategic pivot reflects evolving corporate priorities within the technology and blockchain sectors. The company appears to position itself at the intersection of two transformative technological domains. Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Investment Rationale Riot Platforms’ decision to allocate Bitcoin sale proceeds toward AI infrastructure represents a forward-looking strategic calculation.

That’s just under the $48.7 billion pulled in during 2024. The final week of the year ended strongly, as $671 million came in on Friday, flipping the whole week positive with $571 million, even after some earlier losses. Charts from CoinShares show the biggest surges happened in week 6 and week 18 of 2025, while the worst hits came in weeks 8 and 35. Most of the cash flowed into the U.S., which raked in $44.524 billion, but that was still down 12% from the year before. The real surprise was Germany, which flipped from $43 million in losses in 2024 to $2.5 billion coming in last year. Canada followed the same pattern, with $1.1 billion in inflows after $603 million left the market in the year before. Switzerland saw a small gain; $775 million, up 11.5% from 2024. Bitcoin flops while Ethereum, XRP and Solana pull billions Bitcoin didn’t have a great year, as you probably already know. The OG crypto brought in $26.9 billion, which was 35% lower than the year before. Some traders tried shorting it, as $105 million went into short-Bitcoin funds, but those still only have $139 million total under management. Ethereum, though, pulled in $12.7 billion, up 138% compared to 2024, while XRP brought in $3.7 billion, a 500% spike, and Solana made $3.6 billion, up by a crazy 1000%. But altcoin flows dropped 30%, landing at just $318 million, according to CoinShares. Crypto funds flows by exchange country (US$M) The biggest weekly haul came around week 45. Charts also showed Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other coins with wild inflow swings between week 2 and week 52. One table ranked coins by assets under management. Bitcoin led the pack, with Ethereum behind it. Altcoins Solana and XRP climbed the ladder, but no one passed the top two. Other tables tracked weekly, monthly, and yearly flows by fund providers like iShares and Grayscale, along with their assets under management. Separate charts showed net new assets across digital asset ETPs from 2019 to 2026, revealing how much fresh money got added over time. Traders eye Bitcoin breakout and watch MicroStrategy Meanwhile, options trader Nishant Pant thinks, “The extreme volatility and high capital requirements don’t fit my preferred risk profile.” Nishant’s top pick is MicroStrategy, but he’s not jumping in just yet.“While MSTR is an excellent proxy, it has been trapped in a persistent downtrend since July,” he said. For him, it all comes down to Bitcoin’s chart. “We cannot look at the stock in isolation; we need confirmation from the mothership,” he added. Right now, Bitcoin is sitting a bit above $94,000, which Nishant says is the line in the sand. If it gets past that, he thinks “it will likely act as a rising tide for the entire sector.” Until that happens, he’s watching three things: RSI, DMI, and support and resistance. “RSI has suddenly pivoted,” he explained. “We are seeing a sharp, vertical trajectory in momentum.” For DMI, “the DI+ and DI- lines are beginning to curl and change direction.” That signals buying and selling pressure is starting to change.

But year-over-year change fails to capture the total volatility and opportunity within the period. Bitcoin surged from $75,000 to a new record high of $126,000 - a 70% rise from trough to peak. Ethereum rallied 250% to reach new all-time highs of $4,950 in August before correcting. Risk appetite remains stable in 2026, so in the absence of violent volatility, regular discounted cash flows into cryptocurrencies make sense at these levels. Solana, for instance, could present an interesting alternative, currently trading 50% off its lows. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrencies have been getting whiplashed, with investors noting a stark contrast: despite immense growth in stock indexes and metals, the year-over-year performance for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in 2025 was actually negative . But this headline carries a significant bias. First, year-over-year change fails to capture the total volatility and opportunity within the period. Bitcoin, for example, surged from $75,000 to a new record high of $126,000 - a 70% rise from trough to peak. Traders with a solid game plan who capitalized on these swings fared far better than the yearly close suggests. It is also worth remembering that the crypto pioneer is still up a staggering 480% since its 2023 lows and 123% since 2024, despite finishing 2025 down 3% overall. In a similar vein, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) experienced high-volatility flows, rallying 250% to reach new all-time highs of $4,950 in August before correcting. While it closed the year down roughly 3% compared to January 1st, 2025, it remains up 260% from its 2023 lows. With the implementation of the Fusaka upgrade - enabling significantly cheaper transaction costs and higher efficiency - the second-largest cryptocurrency could see a fundamental ""demand floor"" that would act as cushion against more downside. Furthermore, Bitcoin wasn't the only game in town. Several altcoins posted remarkable gains in 2025, decoupling from the majors. Binance Coin ( BNB-USD ): Up 40% Monero ( XMR-USD ): Up 136% ZCash ( ZEC-USD ): Up a massive 860% The most successful traders were those who leveraged these swift gains, cashing out at relative highs before re-entering at the recent lows. The question now is where things go in 2026. Risk appetite remains stable, so in the absence of violent volatility, regular discounted cash flows into cryptocurrencies make sense at these levels. Solana ( SOL-USD ), for instance, could present an interesting alternative, currently trading 50% off its lows . Let's dive right into the daily charts and technical levels for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. A Quick Glance at the Crypto Market Cap from 2019 to 2026 Total crypto market cap weekly chart, rebounding from its channel lows (Source: TradingView) Overall, the crypto market remained very resilient at its lower bound.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $91,967.84 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price action represents a notable shift in the short-term trajectory of the flagship cryptocurrency, prompting analysis from traders and institutions worldwide. The movement occurs within a broader context of macroeconomic uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscapes, factors that consistently influence digital asset valuations. Bitcoin Price Drops Below Key Psychological Level The descent below $92,000 marks a key psychological level for traders and analysts. Market participants often watch round-number thresholds for signs of support or resistance. Consequently, this breach has triggered a wave of automated selling and portfolio rebalancing. Data from several major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, confirms the downward pressure was not isolated to a single platform. The 24-hour trading volume for Bitcoin has surged by approximately 18%, indicating heightened activity. Furthermore, the move represents a correction of roughly 4.2% from the weekly high of $96,000 recorded just three days prior. Historical data provides essential context for this volatility. For instance, Bitcoin has demonstrated similar pullbacks during previous bull market cycles. A comparative analysis shows that corrections between 10-20% are common during sustained upward trends. Therefore, today’s movement remains within established historical parameters. The current global macroeconomic climate, characterized by fluctuating interest rate expectations and geopolitical tensions, continues to exert influence on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Market sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, has shifted from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ over the past 48 hours. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Market Context Bitcoin’s price movement does not occur in a vacuum. The broader cryptocurrency market, often measured by total market capitalization, has mirrored the decline. Major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have also seen losses ranging from 3% to 7%. This correlated movement suggests a market-wide risk-off sentiment rather than a Bitcoin-specific issue. On-chain analytics from Glassnode reveal several key metrics. For example, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric indicates that a significant portion of the Bitcoin supply remains in a state of profit, which can sometimes precede profit-taking sell pressure. Simultaneously, derivatives market data offers crucial insights. The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has declined slightly, suggesting some leverage has been flushed from the system. More importantly, the funding rates for perpetual swaps have normalized after being slightly positive, reducing the cost for traders holding long positions. Liquidation data from Coinglass shows that the price drop triggered approximately $120 million in long position liquidations across all exchanges. These liquidations can exacerbate downward moves as leveraged positions are forcibly closed by exchanges. Expert Perspectives on Market Dynamics Financial analysts and cryptocurrency researchers have weighed in on the developing situation. Dr. Anya Petrova, a senior market strategist at Digital Asset Research Group, provided a measured assessment. “Today’s price action reflects a healthy market correction,” Petrova stated. “We are observing standard profit-taking behavior following a strong quarterly performance. The fundamental network metrics for Bitcoin—hash rate, active addresses, and accumulation by long-term holders—remain robust.” This perspective aligns with data from on-chain intelligence firms, which show no significant movement of coins from long-term holder wallets to exchanges, a typical precursor to sustained selling. Conversely, Marcus Chen, a derivatives trader at Arca Analytics, highlighted technical factors. “The $92,000 level coincided with the 20-day moving average,” Chen explained. “A break below this technical indicator often triggers algorithmic trading systems to reduce exposure. The next major support zone appears around the $88,500 level, which was the previous consolidation area in late February.” This technical analysis is widely followed by institutional trading desks. Regulatory developments also form a critical part of the backdrop. Recent statements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding custody rules have introduced a note of caution into the market. Impact on Institutional and Retail Investors The price decline has immediate implications for different investor classes. For institutional investors, such as those participating through Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), volatility presents both risk and opportunity. Daily flows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will be closely watched following this dip, as previous corrections have often been met with increased buying. The table below summarizes key price levels and their significance: Price Level Significance $96,000 Weekly High / Resistance $92,000 Psychological Support / 20-Day MA $88,500 Previous Consolidation Zone $85,000 Major Support (50-Day MA) Retail investors, who may be more sensitive to short-term price swings, are advised to consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Market educators consistently emphasize several core principles during periods of volatility: Volatility is inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Focus on long-term fundamentals over daily price action. Employ sound risk management strategies , like position sizing. Avoid making decisions based solely on emotional reactions . Furthermore, the global adoption narrative continues unabated. Several nations are progressing with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) projects, which indirectly legitimizes the digital asset space. Corporate treasury holdings of Bitcoin, led by companies like MicroStrategy, remain unchanged, signaling a commitment to the asset class despite price fluctuations. The network’s security, measured by hash rate, continues to hover near all-time highs, ensuring the integrity of the underlying protocol. Conclusion Bitcoin’s price movement below $92,000 underscores the dynamic and volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. This event, while notable, fits within historical patterns of bull market corrections. The key drivers appear to be a combination of technical selling, macroeconomic sentiment, and normalized derivatives markets. Fundamental indicators for the Bitcoin network remain strong, suggesting the long-term thesis is intact. Market participants will now monitor whether the $92,000 level can be reclaimed as support or if further testing of lower price zones is necessary. As always, informed decision-making based on data, rather than speculation, is paramount in navigating these market conditions. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $92,000? The decline is attributed to a combination of technical selling after breaking a key moving average, market-wide risk-off sentiment affecting all cryptocurrencies, and the liquidation of over-leveraged long positions in the derivatives market. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, volatility and corrections of this magnitude are common within Bitcoin’s market cycles. Historical data shows periodic pullbacks of 10-20% are typical even during strong bullish trends. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Analysts are watching the previous consolidation zone near $88,500 and the 50-day moving average around $85,000 as the next major potential support levels if the downward pressure continues. Q4: How have Bitcoin ETFs reacted to this price drop? ETF flow data for the day is still pending. Historically, price dips have sometimes led to increased inflows as institutional investors view them as buying opportunities, but this pattern is not guaranteed. Q5: Should retail investors be concerned about this volatility? Volatility is an inherent feature of cryptocurrency markets. Investors should align their actions with their long-term strategy and risk tolerance, rather than reacting to short-term price movements. Diversification and sound risk management are crucial.

The 3 MW pilot, announced on Tuesday in partnership with Bitforest Investment, tests whether high-density computing infrastructure can serve as a practical heat source in cold climates rather than venting excess energy into the atmosphere. The initiative deploys 360 Avalon A1566HA-460T units and four liquid-cooling modules at Bitforest’s tomato greenhouse under a 24-month term targeting 95% uptime. JUST IN: @Canaanio partners with Bitforest in Manitoba for a 3.0 MW project using Avalon computing systems to recycle heat for greenhouse heating. This 24-month pilot aims to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability in agriculture, capturing 90% of server electricity. $CAN pic.twitter.com/UiBu5jFtss — Bitcoin Mining Stock (@miningstockinfo) January 6, 2026 Canaan estimates roughly 90% of server electricity can be captured as heat, outputting water temperatures exceeding 75°C at an all-in power cost of $0.035 per kilowatt-hour, making the economics particularly attractive for energy-intensive agricultural operations. Turning Mining Heat Into Agricultural Energy Heat generated by the mining machines will be captured through a closed-loop heat-exchange system and used to preheat intake water for the greenhouse’s electric boilers. This process allows the facility to reduce its direct heating costs while maintaining optimal growing conditions for year-round crop production. Bitcoin Mining Greenhouse. | Source: Bitcoinbloem The project seeks to measure heat-recovery efficiency, system stability, and operating intensity while evaluating potential capital savings from eliminating industrial cooling towers. Beyond energy reuse, Canaan plans to assess key performance indicators for agricultural applications under real operating conditions, testing the commercial viability of integrating Bitcoin mining with intensive farming operations. Bitforest’s Manitoba facility focuses on year-round tomato cultivation, making a consistent heat supply critical for maintaining production levels during harsh Canadian winters. The greenhouse application represents a practical use case for mining’s thermal output in northern climates where heating costs represent a substantial operational expense, potentially establishing a template for similar dual-purpose installations across Canada’s agricultural sector. Institutional Pressure Accelerates Bitcoin Mining Sustainability Shift Institutional demand is driving Bitcoin mining’s green transformation, according to Kevin O’Leary, who told Cryptonews that major buyers increasingly require sustainably mined coins. O’Leary, speaking alongside Bitzero CEO Mohammed Bakhashwain, argued that Bitcoin mining has delivered net benefits for energy efficiency across the computing sector. “When a coin is created from surplus electricity, as in Bitzero’s Norway site, it’s capturing the value of that energy in perpetuity,” he said. “It’s pushing compute forward and making it more efficient for everybody.” Meanwhile, comprehensive research by independent analyst Daniel Batten challenges persistent criticisms of Bitcoin mining’s grid impact. His analysis , titled “Common Bitcoin Energy Misconceptions,” presents evidence from peer-reviewed studies and real-world grid data that contradicts narratives suggesting the technology burdens power systems and drives up consumer costs. New research shows Bitcoin mining stabilizes electrical grids and reduces consumer costs through flexible demand rather than burdening power systems. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/4I4W2Lkcna — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 5, 2026 Multiple independent studies confirm Bitcoin mining’s capacity to balance electrical grids due to its interruptible nature, particularly on networks transitioning toward higher concentrations of variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind. A whitepaper from Duke University energy experts concluded that Controllable Load Resources, including Bitcoin mining operations, help stabilize grids and defer the costs of expensive infrastructure upgrades. Renewable Energy Now Powers Majority of the Bitcoin Network Cambridge University researchers recently reported that renewable sources now power over 52% of the Bitcoin network, up from 37% in 2022. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance study shows sustainable power in Bitcoin mining includes 9.8% nuclear and 42.6% renewables like hydro, solar, and wind. Source: Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report Natural gas has replaced coal as the single largest energy source for the first time, now accounting for 38.2% of mining electricity versus 25% three years earlier. Coal usage plummeted to 8.9% from 36.6% during the same period, representing one of the most dramatic energy transitions in any industrial sector. The shift reflects miners’ transition toward cheaper, off-grid power sources and marks a substantial reversal in the industry’s carbon footprint.

The money landed in the account of MAGA Inc., a group that has been building a large war chest ahead of the 2026 midterm contests. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses According to Federal Election Commission records, Gemini Trust Company gave 1.5 million USDC, which was converted to dollars when reported. At the same time, Foris Dax Inc., the parent of Crypto.com, made two separate $10 million contributions. Who Might Benefit The contributions add weight to MAGA Inc.’s already large balance. Reports show the super PAC entered 2026 with nearly $300 million on hand, a figure driven by many high-dollar donations from across tech, finance, and other sectors. The PAC says the funds will be used to support candidates and efforts aligned with Trump’s priorities. Money talks in close races. When groups have hundreds of millions available, they can buy more ads, staff, and outreach. That can change outcomes in tightly contested House and Senate battlegrounds, and it can shape which lawmakers hold sway over policy — including rules that affect crypto firms and digital assets. Regulatory And Industry Context Based on reports, the crypto sector has been more active politically in recent years, directing funds to both national PACs and smaller groups that press for friendlier regulation. Some industry leaders have pushed for clearer rules on tokens, custody, and exchanges, and political donations are a tool used alongside lobbying. Campaign strategists say large donations tied to specific industries can sharpen messaging on hot-button topics. In this case, the visible crypto contributions arrive as regulators and lawmakers continue to debate how to treat digital assets. That debate could influence product approvals, enforcement approaches, and tax rules for crypto companies and their customers.

Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has publicly criticized the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) for liquidating 57.55 BTC, valued at approximately $6.36 million, which was confiscated from the Bitcoin mixing service Samourai Wallet last year. This move directly contradicts a growing sentiment, reportedly endorsed by former President Donald Trump, advocating for the U.S. to treat Bitcoin as a strategic national reserve asset. Consequently, this action raises profound questions about the government’s long-term digital asset strategy and its alignment with global financial trends. Senator Lummis Condemns the Samourai Wallet Bitcoin Liquidation Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent advocate for clear and innovation-friendly cryptocurrency legislation, expressed deep concern regarding the USMS transaction. She articulated a fundamental question about the government’s approach to seized digital assets. Specifically, Lummis highlighted a directive from former President Donald Trump to stockpile Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Furthermore, she contrasted the U.S. action with the behavior of other sovereign nations. For instance, countries like El Salvador have made Bitcoin legal tender, while others are reportedly accumulating it as part of their treasury reserves. Lummis argued that selling these assets represents a wasteful depletion of a potentially valuable national resource in an increasingly digital global economy. The seized Bitcoin originated from the Samourai Wallet case, where federal authorities alleged the service facilitated money laundering. In April 2024, the Department of Justice arrested the founders and seized the service’s domain and servers. This enforcement action was part of a broader crackdown on cryptocurrency mixers, or tumblers, which authorities claim can obfuscate the trail of illicit funds. However, the subsequent disposal of the seized asset has now become a separate point of contention, shifting the conversation from law enforcement to fiscal and monetary strategy. The Broader Context of Government-Held Cryptocurrency The U.S. government holds one of the world’s largest stockpiles of seized Bitcoin, primarily from criminal forfeitures. The USMS has historically managed and sold these assets through public auctions. This process converts volatile digital assets into stable U.S. dollars for the Treasury. However, critics like Senator Lummis challenge this established protocol. They propose a paradigm shift where Bitcoin is treated not as contraband to be quickly monetized but as a strategic financial instrument to be held. Comparing Global Bitcoin Reserve Strategies This debate occurs against a backdrop of evolving global strategies. Several nations are exploring or have implemented Bitcoin holdings as part of their economic policy. The table below outlines a simplified comparison of different national approaches: Country/Entity Bitcoin Strategy Reported Holdings (Est.) United States (Government) Seizure and periodic liquidation via USMS auctions. Varies based on seizures; not officially held as reserves. El Salvador Legal tender; daily dollar-cost-average purchases. Over 5,700 BTC (as of early 2025). MicroStrategy (Corporate) Primary treasury reserve asset. Over 200,000 BTC. This global context underscores Senator Lummis’s argument. If peer nations and major corporations are accumulating Bitcoin, a routine sale by the U.S. could be viewed as a strategic misstep. It potentially forfeits future appreciation and influence in the digital asset ecosystem. Legal and Operational Implications of the Sale The sale by the U.S. Marshals Service was likely a standard execution of existing forfeiture protocol. The agency has a mandate to efficiently convert seized property into cash for victims and the Treasury. From an operational standpoint, selling volatile assets quickly mitigates the government’s price risk. However, this practical approach now clashes with emerging high-level policy discussions about Bitcoin’s role. The incident exposes a potential disconnect between operational agencies following old rules and political leaders envisioning new ones. Key legal and procedural questions arise from this event: Authority: Does the USMS have the discretion to hold assets, or is it mandated to liquidate? Policy Gap: Is there a formal, unified federal policy on treating seized cryptocurrency as a strategic asset? Precedent: Could this sale set a precedent that undermines future efforts to create a national Bitcoin reserve? These questions lack simple answers. They suggest that the incident may catalyze legislative efforts to formalize the government’s approach to digital asset forfeitures. Senator Lummis, who co-sponsored the bipartisan Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, is positioned to lead such efforts. Expert Perspectives on Strategic Asset Management Financial analysts and blockchain policy experts often highlight the unique nature of Bitcoin. Unlike seized physical goods like cars or art, Bitcoin is a globally traded, borderless, and digitally scarce asset. Some experts analogize selling seized Bitcoin to selling seized gold bars immediately without considering gold’s role as a monetary hedge. They argue that a strategic treasury might hold such an asset, especially as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) develop. This perspective adds weight to the criticism that automatic liquidation may be a short-sighted policy in a long-term digital transformation. Conclusion The sale of seized Samourai Wallet Bitcoin by the U.S. Marshals Service has transcended a routine administrative act. It has become a focal point in a critical debate about America’s strategic posture in the digital age. Senator Cynthia Lummis’s criticism underscores a growing tension between traditional asset forfeiture processes and a forward-looking vision of Bitcoin as a national strategic asset. As other nations actively accumulate cryptocurrency, the United States faces a pivotal choice: continue liquidating seized digital assets or develop a cohesive strategy to harness their potential. The outcome of this policy debate will significantly influence the nation’s role in the future of global finance and digital sovereignty. FAQs Q1: What Bitcoin did the U.S. Marshals Service sell? The USMS sold 57.55 Bitcoin, worth about $6.36 million, that was seized from the operators of Samourai Wallet, a cryptocurrency mixing service, in 2024. Q2: Why is Senator Lummis criticizing this sale? Senator Lummis criticizes the sale because it contradicts the idea of the U.S. government holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. She argues that while other nations are accumulating Bitcoin, the U.S. should not waste potentially valuable assets through liquidation. Q3: What is the connection to former President Donald Trump? Senator Lummis cited reports that former President Trump has directed that Bitcoin be stockpiled as a strategic asset. Her criticism positions the USMS sale as being at odds with this suggested policy direction. Q4: What is a Bitcoin mixer or tumbler like Samourai Wallet? A Bitcoin mixer is a service that pools and scrambles cryptocurrencies from multiple users to obscure the transaction trail on the blockchain. Law enforcement agencies often target them for potentially facilitating money laundering, which was the allegation against Samourai Wallet. Q5: Does the U.S. government still hold other Bitcoin? Yes, the U.S. government, primarily through the U.S. Marshals Service and other agencies, continues to hold significant amounts of Bitcoin seized from various criminal cases. The debate is about whether to continue selling it or to hold it long-term.

Daily volume is over $5.5 billion. Despite the recent bounce, the asset remains below a key resistance level, which analysts say could decide whether the trend continues or stalls. $146 Marks a Key Level Analyst Man of Bitcoin views the recent rise as corrective. He noted that as long as SOL stays under $146, there’s a chance the downtrend resumes. His chart shows a wave structure where the current move fits within a wave-4 correction. If that’s accurate, a fifth wave lower could still play out. He marked possible downside targets near $118 and $107. The $146–$149 area is being watched. A close above this zone would weaken the bearish view. Until then, the structure remains vulnerable to reversal. Elsewhere, CryptoCurb pointed to a MACD buy signal on the 3-day chart, the first since April 2025 when SOL traded near $95. At the time, that signal preceded a strong rally. With SOL now around $138, they wrote, “ $200+ with haste ,” suggesting that momentum is building again. $SOL buy signal confirmed on the 3-Day MACD momentum indicator for the 1st time since the $95 april lows $200+ with haste. #SOLANA pic.twitter.com/rqpRNtB62m — curb.sol (@CryptoCurb) January 6, 2026 The MACD crossover adds weight to the bullish side, but confirmation would need a break of near-term resistance. Until that happens, traders are treating the move with caution. Whale Activity and Network Flows Large wallet holders have increased exposure, according to on-chain data. CW said , “Whales are increasing their long positions in expecting $SOL rise.” Stablecoin supply on Solana has also grown, now totaling more than $15 billion, based on DefiLlama data. This often reflects increased usage and capital flow into the ecosystem. Reports from CryptoPotato show steady accumulation by larger accounts. These wallets have been active since early January, suggesting a shift in sentiment among long-term holders. Meanwhile, institutional demand for SOL continues to grow. CryptoBusy reported that ETFs and other structured products now hold over 28 million SOL, worth $3.81 billion. This demand has remained steady through recent price swings.

56903679,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259112,1767727510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum Double Bottom Pattern Sparks Crucial Recovery Signal: Potential $3,900 Target in Sight",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-double-bottom-pattern-recovery/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Double Bottom Pattern Sparks Crucial Recovery Signal: Potential $3,900 Target in Sight In a significant development for cryptocurrency markets, the Ethereum daily chart now displays a compelling double bottom pattern, potentially signaling a major recovery toward the $3,900 level. This technical formation, emerging from analysis of market data, suggests a pivotal moment for ETH as it navigates critical resistance levels. Market analysts globally are closely monitoring this pattern, which has developed since late last year, for confirmation of a sustained bullish reversal. Understanding the Ethereum Double Bottom Pattern A double bottom pattern represents a classic technical analysis formation indicating potential trend reversal. This pattern manifests when an asset’s price touches a support level twice, forming two distinct troughs, before initiating an upward movement. For Ethereum, this pattern began developing in the fourth quarter of last year, demonstrating consistent demand at a specific price zone. Consequently, each successful defense of this support level strengthens the pattern’s validity. Technical analysts emphasize that completion of this formation requires a decisive break above the resistance level connecting the peaks between the two troughs. Historically, double bottom patterns have preceded significant price recoveries across various asset classes. In cryptocurrency markets, these patterns gain particular importance due to their relative rarity on daily timeframes. The current ETH pattern’s projected target of $3,900 represents approximately a 20% increase from recent price levels. This target derives from measuring the distance between the pattern’s neckline and its troughs, then projecting that distance upward from the breakout point. Market participants should note that pattern completion requires specific confirmation criteria beyond mere visual appearance. Technical Hurdles and the 200-Day EMA Challenge The primary obstacle for Ethereum’s bullish scenario involves reclaiming the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). This long-term indicator has acted as formidable resistance since November of last year. Specifically, ETH has failed twice to sustain momentum above this critical level, with each rejection accelerating subsequent downward movements. A daily candle closing decisively above the 200-day EMA would therefore represent a crucial technical victory. Such an event could enable Ethereum to break above its long-term trend resistance line, potentially validating the double bottom pattern. Technical analysts monitor several key indicators alongside the 200-day EMA: Volume Confirmation: Breakouts require increasing trading volume for validation Relative Strength Index (RSI): Momentum indicators must support upward movement Support/Resistance Levels: Historical price zones that influence future movements Market Structure: Overall trend alignment across multiple timeframes The 200-day EMA’s significance stems from its widespread use among institutional and retail traders alike. Many algorithmic trading systems incorporate this indicator into their decision-making processes. Therefore, a sustained break above this level could trigger automated buying pressure across multiple trading platforms. Market data from previous cycles shows that reclaiming the 200-day EMA often precedes extended bullish periods for major cryptocurrencies. Historical Context and Market Psychology Ethereum’s current technical setup occurs within a broader market context that includes regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and network upgrades. The pattern’s development since Q4 2024 aligns with several fundamental events affecting cryptocurrency markets globally. Market psychology plays a crucial role in pattern formation, as trader behavior around key support and resistance levels creates the technical formations analysts observe. The repeated defense of the support zone indicates persistent buyer interest at specific price points, suggesting accumulation by longer-term investors. Comparative analysis with previous market cycles reveals interesting parallels. During the 2020-2021 bull market, Ethereum displayed similar technical patterns before significant upward movements. However, each market cycle possesses unique characteristics influenced by macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environments, and technological developments. The current pattern’s potential completion would represent Ethereum’s recovery from a prolonged consolidation phase, possibly initiating a new market structure. Analysts caution that technical patterns provide probability-based guidance rather than certainty, requiring confirmation through price action and volume analysis. Broader Market Implications and Risk Considerations Ethereum’s potential recovery carries implications beyond its individual price action. As the leading smart contract platform, ETH often influences broader altcoin market sentiment. A sustained recovery could signal improved conditions for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) markets, and layer-2 scaling solutions built on the Ethereum network. Market correlations between Ethereum and Bitcoin remain significant, though decreasing slightly as Ethereum establishes more independent fundamental drivers. Risk management considerations for traders and investors include: Risk Factor Description Mitigation Strategy False Breakout Price briefly breaks pattern then reverses Wait for confirmation with volume and closing prices Market-Wide Downturn Broader cryptocurrency decline Monitor Bitcoin dominance and total market cap Regulatory Developments Policy changes affecting crypto markets Stay informed about global regulatory trends Network Issues Technical problems or security concerns Follow Ethereum developer communications Professional traders emphasize that technical patterns function best within comprehensive trading strategies incorporating fundamental analysis, risk management, and portfolio diversification. The cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility means that even high-probability setups can fail if unexpected market events occur. Therefore, position sizing and stop-loss placement remain essential components of any trading approach based on technical analysis. Conclusion The emerging Ethereum double bottom pattern presents a technically significant development for cryptocurrency markets, potentially signaling recovery toward the $3,900 level. This formation’s completion requires Ethereum to overcome the crucial 200-day EMA resistance, a level that has repelled previous recovery attempts. Market participants should monitor volume confirmation and broader market conditions alongside this technical setup. While patterns provide valuable insights, prudent investors combine technical analysis with fundamental research and risk management practices. The coming weeks will determine whether this Ethereum double bottom pattern validates as a genuine trend reversal or represents another false signal in volatile cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a double bottom pattern in technical analysis? A double bottom pattern is a chart formation that resembles the letter “W,” indicating potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. It forms when price touches a support level twice before breaking above the resistance level between the two troughs. Q2: How reliable are double bottom patterns for predicting price movements? While no technical pattern guarantees future price movements, double bottom formations have historically shown reasonable reliability when confirmed with strong volume and supporting indicators. Their effectiveness improves when they align with broader market trends and fundamental factors. Q3: Why is the 200-day EMA so important for Ethereum’s price analysis? The 200-day exponential moving average represents a long-term trend indicator widely monitored by traders and institutions. It often acts as dynamic support in bull markets and resistance in bear markets, making breakouts above this level technically significant events. Q4: What time frame should traders use to identify double bottom patterns? Double bottom patterns can appear on various time frames, but daily and weekly charts generally provide more reliable signals than shorter time frames. The current Ethereum pattern appears on the daily chart, suggesting intermediate-term significance. Q5: How does Ethereum’s technical pattern relate to broader cryptocurrency market conditions? Ethereum often leads or reflects broader altcoin market sentiment. A confirmed recovery pattern for ETH could signal improving conditions for other smart contract platforms and decentralized applications, though Bitcoin’s influence remains substantial for overall market direction.

56903807,654293,1767727845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56903807.jpeg,Ethereum Founder Returns With Fix For Major Network Problems Amid Price Rebound,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-major-network-problems/,bitcoinist,"Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum (ETH) , has announced new improvements to address persistent challenges in the decentralized network. The announcement comes as the Ethereum price surges more than 8% from the beginning of the year, signaling a strong rebound from previous bearish trends. Ethereum Founder Introduces Solutions To Network Issues Buterin has returned with solutions to long-standing network issues as ETH rebounds, pushing its price above $3,220 . The Ethereum founder disclosed that Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) have reached an alpha stage, offering product-quality performance, while final safety audits are still ongoing. At the same time, Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) is already live on the mainnet, delivering a critical piece of Ethereum’s next-generational infrastructure. According to Buterin, these upgrades aren’t just minor improvements. They fundamentally transform Ethereum into a more powerful and resilient decentralized network . He compared Ethereum’s evolution to earlier peer-to-peer networks such as BitTorrent and Bitcoin. While BitTorrent offered massive bandwidth and decentralization, it lacked consensus. Conversely, Bitcoin ensured decentralization and consensus but at the expense of bandwidth . With the introduction of PeerDAS and zkEVMs , Buterin says that ETH has officially achieved complete decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth. He describes this milestone as solving the blockchain “trilemma” with live, functioning code. He also emphasized that these developments represent a decade-long effort, tracing back to the earliest commits on data availability sampling and the initiation of zkEVM development around 2020. Looking ahead, the Ethereum founder expects the network’s full vision to unfold over the next four years. He disclosed that in 2026, gas limits will increase thanks to Block-Level Access Lists (BALs) and Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS), while zkEVM nodes will begin operating on segments of the network. Between 2026 and 2028, Buterin says, Ethereum will adjust gas pricing , restructure state, and integrate execution payloads into blobs to safely accommodate higher limits. Finally, by 2027-2030, zkEVMs are expected to become the primary method of block validation, enabling further large-scale increases in the gas limit. Buterin suggests that these upcoming advancements will solve the long-standing problem in decentralized networks, where only two of three key properties, decentralization, security, and speed, can co-exist. Thanks to its new upgrades, ETH now has all three. Buterin Outlines Plans For Distributed Block Building In his post, Buterin unveiled further network upgrades focused on distributed block building . He envisions a long-term goal in which no full block is ever assembled in a single location. While this is not an immediate need, the founder believes it’s important to start developing this capability to prepare for the blockchain network’s future. In the meantime, he emphasized that block-building authority should remain as widely distributed as possible. This can be done in two ways: either within the protocol itself by expanding Fork Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) to handle transactions, or externally through distributed builder marketplaces. According to Buterin, these initiatives aim to reduce the risk of centralized interference in transaction inclusion. At the same time, they promote greater geographical fairness across the Ethereum network.",Ethereum|BALs|Block-Level Access Lists|Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation|ePBS|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Mainnet|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|FOCIL|Fork Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists|Peer Data Availability Sampling|Peerdas|vitalik buterin|Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines|zkEVMs,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56905114,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259118,1767730511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Drop: The $100M Profit-Taking Sell-Off That Shook Crypto Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-drop-profit-taking-sell-off/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: The $100M Profit-Taking Sell-Off That Shook Crypto Markets Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant volatility on January 6, 2025, as Bitcoin’s price dropped to $91,000 following a massive $100 million profit-taking sell-off that revealed critical market dynamics. This Bitcoin price drop represents more than a simple correction—it exposes the complex interplay between investor psychology, technical resistance levels, and market liquidity that shapes cryptocurrency valuation patterns. Analyzing the Bitcoin Price Drop Mechanics Market analysts identified approximately $100 million in concentrated sell orders as the primary catalyst for Bitcoin’s recent decline. According to comprehensive order book data from major exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, these sell orders clustered specifically between the $94,000 and $95,000 price range. This liquidity concentration created what technical analysts describe as a “ceiling effect,” effectively halting Bitcoin’s upward momentum and triggering cascading sell orders. The cryptocurrency initially recovered to $94,000 on January 6 before retreating sharply. This pattern demonstrates a classic failed breakout attempt, where buying pressure proved insufficient to overcome concentrated selling at a key psychological resistance level. Market participants responded to this technical failure with accelerated profit-taking, creating the downward pressure that pushed Bitcoin to its $91,000 low. Technical Resistance and Market Psychology The $94,000-$95,000 resistance zone represents more than just a price point—it embodies significant psychological and technical barriers that have developed over months of trading activity. Historical data shows this range previously served as both support and resistance throughout late 2024, creating what analysts call a “memory level” where past trading decisions influence current market behavior. Several factors contributed to this resistance zone’s strength: Previous All-Time High Proximity: The $95,000 level approached Bitcoin’s previous all-time high from November 2024 Options Expiry Concentration: Significant options contracts expired near this price range Institutional Profit Targets: Many institutional investors established take-profit orders in this zone Technical Indicator Convergence: Multiple moving averages and Fibonacci retracement levels converged around $94,500 This convergence of technical factors created what market technicians describe as a “perfect storm” for resistance, where multiple independent indicators aligned to create substantial selling pressure. Order Book Dynamics and Liquidity Analysis Advanced order book analysis reveals sophisticated market structure behind the $100 million sell-off. The distribution followed a specific pattern: Price Range Sell Order Volume Percentage of Total Order Type Distribution $94,000-$94,300 $35 million 35% 60% Limit, 40% Market $94,300-$94,700 $42 million 42% 70% Limit, 30% Market $94,700-$95,000 $23 million 23% 55% Limit, 45% Market This distribution indicates strategic placement rather than panic selling, with the majority of orders positioned as limit orders at specific price points. The concentration around $94,300-$94,700 suggests institutional rather than retail activity, as retail traders typically distribute orders more evenly across wider ranges. Historical Context and Market Comparisons The current Bitcoin price drop follows historical patterns observed during previous bull market corrections. Similar profit-taking events occurred in 2017 at the $19,000 resistance and in 2021 at the $64,000 level, both preceding significant consolidation periods before eventual breakthroughs. Comparatively, the $100 million sell volume represents approximately 0.5% of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume, which averaged $20 billion throughout January 2025. This percentage aligns with typical profit-taking events during sustained uptrends, where 0.3%-0.7% of daily volume often triggers short-term corrections. Market analysts note several distinguishing factors about this particular event: Speed of Recovery Attempt: Bitcoin’s rapid rebound to $94,000 indicates underlying buying strength Volume Concentration: The highly concentrated sell orders suggest coordinated rather than dispersed selling Derivatives Market Impact: Futures open interest decreased by 15% during the decline, indicating deleveraging Options Market Reaction: Put/Call ratio increased from 0.65 to 0.82, reflecting heightened hedging activity Institutional vs. Retail Behavior Patterns Analysis of wallet movements and exchange flows reveals distinct behavioral patterns between institutional and retail participants during this Bitcoin price drop. Institutional entities, identified as wallets holding 100+ BTC, demonstrated net accumulation during the decline, increasing their holdings by approximately 8,000 BTC in the 24 hours following the drop. Conversely, retail wallets (holding Market Structure Implications and Future Outlook The $100 million profit-taking event provides valuable insights into current market structure and potential future developments. The concentrated resistance at $94,000-$95,000 suggests this level will require substantial buying pressure to overcome, potentially necessitating consolidation or retest of lower support levels before successful breakthrough. Technical analysts identify several key levels to monitor: Immediate Support: $90,000-$91,000 (recent consolidation zone) Primary Support: $87,500 (200-day moving average convergence) Secondary Resistance: $94,000-$95,000 (recent failure zone) Primary Resistance: $98,000 (psychological round number) Market participants should note that successful consolidation above $92,000 could establish a new support base for future upward movements, while failure to hold $90,000 might indicate deeper correction potential. Conclusion The Bitcoin price drop to $91,000, driven by $100 million in profit-taking sell orders, represents a normal market correction within an ongoing uptrend rather than a trend reversal. This event highlights the importance of technical resistance levels, order book analysis, and investor psychology in cryptocurrency markets. As Bitcoin continues trading at $92,123.08 with a 2.25% decline, market structure suggests potential consolidation before renewed attempts to overcome the $94,000-$95,000 resistance zone. The Bitcoin price drop ultimately serves as a reminder of market dynamics where profit-taking at key levels creates both short-term volatility and long-term opportunities. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to drop to $91,000? Approximately $100 million in concentrated sell orders between $94,000 and $95,000 triggered profit-taking that pushed Bitcoin to $91,000. This liquidity cluster created technical resistance that halted upward momentum. Q2: Is this Bitcoin price drop a sign of market weakness? Not necessarily. The drop represents normal profit-taking at a key resistance level within an ongoing trend. Institutional accumulation during the decline suggests underlying strength rather than fundamental weakness. Q3: How does this compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? This correction aligns with historical patterns where 0.3%-0.7% of daily volume triggers short-term pullbacks during bull markets. Similar events occurred at $19,000 in 2017 and $64,000 in 2021. Q4: What price levels should traders watch now? Key levels include support at $90,000-$91,000 and $87,500, with resistance at $94,000-$95,000 and $98,000. Successful consolidation above $92,000 could support future upward movements. Q5: Did institutional or retail investors cause the sell-off? Analysis suggests coordinated institutional selling created the initial resistance, while retail investors contributed to subsequent downward momentum through reactive selling during the decline.

Maine Bitcoin Depot ATM victims will be settled According to an update shared to the official website of Maine’s BCCP, Bitcoin Depot, with assistance from the Maine Attorney General, has resolved its concerns with Bitcoin Depot’s practices. The update claims that the BCCP’s agreement with Bitcoin Depot will see the company pay $1.9 million dollars which will be used to pay Mainers who lost money in scams perpetrated at Bitcoin Depot kiosks throughout the state by a third party. The consent agreement also granted Bitcoin Depot a money transmitter license, allowing it to operate legally in the state, although Maine is not listed among active locations on the company’s website. The agreement comes after a two-year-long investigation, and only people who were taken advantage of by a third party while using a Bitcoin Depot kiosk may be eligible for a refund. Such people must have been Maine residents between 2022 and 2025 and must have used a Bitcoin Depot kiosk in Maine during the same period to convert cash to cryptocurrency. They must also have deposited the cryptocurrency into an “unhosted wallet” provided by a scammer or other third-party fraudster . An “unhosted wallet” is a type of digital wallet hosted and controlled by a user, rather than a financial institution, money transmitter, exchange or other virtual asset service provider. The deadline for filing a claim on the Bureau’s website is April 1, 2026, and claims that come after that day will reportedly be dismissed. Those who tick all the boxes and file a claim within the time limit are expected to receive their refunds sometime in May after processing. As for how much the refunds will be, the Bureau has claimed it will not know until it has received and reviewed all of the claims. This is because it is unclear how many Mainers lost funds to scams via Bitcoin Depot kiosks, exactly where they were located, or how much money each victim might receive. Maine’s Governor praised the Bureau for consent agreement The governor of Maine, Janet Mills, praised the Bureau for the consent agreement with Bitcoin Depot, claiming it “will put money back into the pockets of Maine people who were defrauded by predatory third-party scammers.” Mills is very particular about consumer protection and has urged all Mainers “to talk with their loved ones about the threats of scammers and precautions to take to avoid these cruel and often sophisticated schemes.” In response to the increased rate of financial losses linked to scams, Maine has adopted laws that protect consumers from third-party scammers, including the Maine Money Transmission Modernization Act, which was signed in 2024. Last June, Mills also signed an emergency law, “An Act to Regulate Virtual Currency Kiosks,” that put a cap on daily transmission amounts from virtual currency kiosks , and limited fees and exchange rates, while providing redress for consumers. Superintendent of the BCCP, Linda Conti, has praised the new consumer protection laws as the foundation that enabled the consent agreement to happen. The laws include an unhosted wallet provision, which requires money transmitters to employ new technologies to ensure that Maine consumers own and control their virtual wallets.

This surge represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, marking its highest valuation in the current market cycle and igniting discussions about its underlying drivers and future trajectory. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Psychological Barrier The ascent past $93,000 is not merely a numerical achievement. Consequently, it represents a critical breach of a major psychological resistance level that analysts had closely monitored. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure throughout the trading session. Furthermore, trading volume spiked by approximately 35% compared to the weekly average, indicating strong institutional and retail participation. This price action follows a consolidation period between $88,000 and $92,500, suggesting a buildup of momentum that finally found an outlet. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a pattern of testing and eventually surpassing round-number thresholds before establishing new support levels. The $93,000 level now becomes a focal point for technical analysts. Key indicators supporting the move include: On-Chain Activity: A notable increase in the number of new unique addresses. Exchange Outflows: Net movements of BTC from exchanges to private wallets, signaling a holding mentality. Futures Market: Open interest rose, but funding rates remained relatively neutral, avoiding excessive leverage. Analyzing the Catalysts Behind the Rally Several fundamental and macroeconomic factors converge to explain Bitcoin’s impressive performance. Primarily, evolving regulatory clarity in major economies has provided a more stable framework for institutional investment. Simultaneously, continued adoption by traditional finance (TradFi) entities, including new spot Bitcoin ETF products, has created a sustained source of demand. Moreover, broader macroeconomic conditions, characterized by concerns over currency devaluation and search for inflation-resistant assets, continue to drive capital toward scarce digital assets. The current rally also aligns with Bitcoin’s historical halving cycle theory. The most recent block reward halving occurred in April 2024, an event that historically precedes a period of price appreciation in the following 12-18 months as new supply issuance is cut in half. While past performance never guarantees future results, this cyclical pattern provides a contextual backdrop that many long-term investors consider. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the difference between speculative spikes and sustainable growth. “The move above $93,000 appears structurally different from past parabolic rallies,” notes a market strategist from a leading crypto research firm. “We are observing a more diversified buyer base, including corporate treasuries and long-only funds, which suggests a deeper market foundation.” This sentiment is echoed by on-chain analysts who point to the rising ‘realized price’—the average price at which all circulating BTC was last moved—as a sign of increasing overall investor cost basis and potential market health. Comparative data with traditional assets further contextualizes the move. Over the same period, major stock indices showed modest gains, while gold traded sideways. This divergence highlights Bitcoin’s increasingly unique role as a non-correlated, high-growth potential asset class within a diversified portfolio, a thesis gaining traction among mainstream allocators. Historical Context and Future Trajectory To understand the significance of the $93,000 level, a brief historical review is essential. Bitcoin first reached $1,000 in 2013, $10,000 in 2017, and $60,000 in 2021. Each milestone followed periods of intense network development and growing public awareness. The path to the current price involved recovering from a significant bear market in 2022, followed by a steady climb characterized by reduced volatility compared to previous cycles, according to volatility index data. Looking forward, key levels to watch include the previous all-time high near $98,000 and the symbolic $100,000 mark. Market participants will monitor several metrics for signs of continuation or consolidation: Metric Current Status Bullish Signal MVRV Z-Score Elevated but not extreme Suggests room for growth before overvaluation Network Hash Rate At all-time high Indicates strong security and miner commitment HODLer Net Position Change Positive Long-term holders are accumulating, not distributing Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $93,000 marks a definitive chapter in its financial evolution. This achievement stems from a complex interplay of institutional adoption, macroeconomic trends, and Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity model. While market movements are inherently unpredictable, the current landscape demonstrates a maturation in market structure and participant sophistication. The Bitcoin price milestone serves as a powerful reminder of the asset’s resilience and its growing integration into the global financial system. Observers will now watch to see if this level consolidates into a new support zone, paving the way for the next phase of the market cycle. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price when it crossed $93,000? According to real-time data from Bitcoin World on the Binance USDT market, BTC was trading at $93,020.55 when it surpassed the $93,000 threshold. Q2: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The previous all-time high for Bitcoin was approximately $98,000, reached in late 2024. The current price of ~$93,020 represents a recovery of over 95% of that peak value. Q3: What are common factors that cause Bitcoin’s price to increase? Major drivers include increased institutional adoption (like ETF inflows), positive regulatory developments, macroeconomic instability driving demand for alternative assets, Bitcoin’s programmed scarcity (halving events), and broader technological adoption of its blockchain network. Q4: Is now a good time to invest in Bitcoin? This article provides factual market analysis, not financial advice. All investments carry risk. Potential investors should conduct their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and understand that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Consulting a qualified financial advisor is recommended. Q5: Where can I check the live Bitcoin price? Live prices are available on major cryptocurrency data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, as well as on the trading interfaces of licensed and regulated exchanges. Always verify you are using official websites to avoid scams.

This strategic delay, confirmed in early 2025, effectively maintains the status quo for prominent firms like MicroStrategy and alleviates immediate fears of a massive, forced sell-off in digital asset markets. The move follows extensive industry consultation and reflects the complex integration of crypto assets into traditional corporate finance. MSCI Crypto Exclusion Delay: Analyzing the 2026 Timeline MSCI initiated formal market consultations on this critical issue in October 2024. The proposal considered removing companies whose balance sheets held predominantly crypto assets from its influential global indexes. Consequently, the decision to delay provides a two-year window for observation and adaptation. This period allows for further maturation of cryptocurrency accounting standards and regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, it gives institutional investors more time to develop coherent policies regarding crypto exposure within indexed funds. The consultation process revealed significant concerns from asset managers and publicly listed companies. Many argued that a blanket exclusion would be premature. They emphasized that corporate Bitcoin strategies represent a legitimate, albeit novel, treasury management approach. Therefore, MSCI’s pause demonstrates a cautious, evidence-based methodology. The provider will likely use the intervening years to gather more data on volatility, liquidity, and correlation effects. Understanding the Multi-Billion Dollar Market Impact The potential financial ramifications of an immediate exclusion were substantial. Industry analysts, including those cited in the AggrNews report, projected that such a move could trigger up to $15 billion in selling pressure. This figure, equivalent to approximately 22 trillion South Korean won, underscores the scale of capital now tied to corporate crypto strategies. The selling would originate from index-tracking funds mandated to replicate MSCI’s compositions precisely. Passive Fund Liquidation: Billions in assets under management (AUM) within ETFs and mutual funds that track MSCI indexes would be forced to sell holdings in affected companies. Price Discovery Disruption: A concentrated sell-off could distort the share price of companies like MicroStrategy, decoupling it from business fundamentals. Broader Crypto Market Correlation: Significant selling of corporate Bitcoin reserves could create downward pressure on the underlying cryptocurrency markets. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at investment manager VanEck, provided crucial context. He confirmed that MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) will not face immediate exclusion. This news provides stability for the company and its shareholders. MicroStrategy has pioneered the corporate Bitcoin reserve strategy, amassing holdings worth billions of dollars. Expert Insight: The Rationale Behind the Pause Financial experts point to several logical reasons for the delay. First, the accounting treatment of digital assets remains in flux under both U.S. GAAP and IFRS standards. Second, regulatory clarity from bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still evolving. Third, the performance of companies with large crypto reserves through different market cycles needs longer assessment. MSCI, therefore, opts for a prudent ‘wait-and-see’ approach. This approach prioritizes index stability and investor predictability over rapid, disruptive change. The timeline below outlines key events leading to this decision: Date Event Significance Q4 2023 – 2024 Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block Inc. allocate significant capital to Bitcoin. October 2024 MSCI Launches Market Consultation Formally proposes potential exclusion criteria for crypto-heavy firms, seeking industry feedback. Q1 2025 Consultation Period Concludes Widespread concern from asset managers and companies is formally recorded. Early 2025 MSCI Announces Delay to 2026 Review Decision to maintain current index composition, providing a two-year reprieve. The MicroStrategy Precedent and Corporate Strategy MicroStrategy, under executive chairman Michael Saylor, has become the canonical example of this corporate trend. The company’s market valuation now closely correlates with Bitcoin’s price movements. Its inclusion in major indexes like the MSCI USA Index grants it access to a vast pool of passive capital. An exclusion would sever that access and potentially increase its cost of capital. The delay allows MicroStrategy and similar firms to continue their strategy without the overhang of imminent index removal. Other public companies with notable crypto holdings are monitoring this situation closely. These include technology firms and traditional corporations diversifying their treasury assets. The MSCI decision sets a precedent for other index providers like S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell. Their policies will now be scrutinized in light of MSCI’s cautious stance. The next two years will serve as a critical live case study for the financial community. Conclusion The MSCI crypto exclusion delay until 2026 represents a significant moment of stability for the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. By postponing a definitive decision, MSCI acknowledges the complexity and evolving nature of corporate cryptocurrency adoption. This pause mitigates the risk of a disruptive $15 billion sell-off. It also provides essential breathing room for companies, regulators, and accountants to establish clearer frameworks. The 2026 review will be a landmark event, shaping how global indexes treat innovative asset classes for years to come. FAQs Q1: What did MSCI decide regarding companies with crypto reserves? MSCI decided to delay any potential exclusion of companies with significant cryptocurrency reserves from its indexes until its next major review in 2026. This maintains the current index composition for now. Q2: Why was there concern about a $15 billion sell-off? Analysts projected that if MSCI excluded these companies, passive index funds tracking MSCI would be forced to sell their holdings. This could have created up to $15 billion in coordinated selling pressure on both the companies’ shares and their underlying crypto assets. Q3: How does this affect MicroStrategy (MSTR)? MicroStrategy, which holds a large Bitcoin reserve, will remain in MSCI’s indexes until at least the 2026 review. This provides stability for its shareholder base and continued access to capital from index-tracking funds. Q4: What happens during the delay until 2026? The two-year period allows for further observation of market trends, evolution of accounting standards for crypto assets, and development of clearer regulatory guidance. MSCI will likely use this time to gather more data. Q5: Does this mean MSCI will never exclude crypto-heavy companies? No, the delay is not a final decision. MSCI has simply postponed its ruling. The 2026 review will re-evaluate the issue based on market conditions, regulatory developments, and corporate performance data available at that time.

As sentiment turns, capital is flowing selectively into top altcoins rather than the leading cryptocurrency, with Solana at the center of that rotation. The first week of the year has pushed SOL up 10%, while Bitcoin lags at 6%, outperformance that could define investor positioning for the months ahead. A trend that continues from 2025, with Solana leading the top altcoin cohort with a 1000% increase in inflows from the year prior, while Bitcoin lapsed 35%. Solana outperforms in year-over-year inflows. Source: Coinshares . Although Bitcoin dominance rose during the long 2025 consolidation, investor appetite for altcoins never disappeared. With sentiment now shifting, conditions are forming for a potential altcoin season, and Solana is positioning itself as the frontrunner. Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Overtake BTC? The 2025 consolidation materialized as a descending triangle structure, which could now be on the breakout path as sentiment drives fresh inflows. Momentum indicators reflect the shift. SOL / USD 1-day chart, year-long descending channel. Source: TradingView . The RSI has made a decisive cross above the 50 neutral line, at levels unseen since September at 57, before geopolitical uncertainty plunged the market into extreme fear conditions. The MACD reads much the same with a wide lead above the signal line, suggesting bulls are back in control of the prevailing trend. This bullish backdrop affirms the lower boundary of the triangle as a launchpad yet again, and with it, a breakout push may be underway. The key breakout threshold is strong December resistance at $210. If flipped back into support, it could act as a firmer and higher footing for a confirmed 265% breakout push to $500. And as the bull market matures and bullish sentiment grows, fundamental catalysts like the Alpenglow upgrade could push a bigger 625% move to $1000. Still, while it is credible that Solana could go on to outperform Bitcoin again this year, flipping it in market cap is a distant goal. Bitcoin Hyper: Bitcoin Could Still Beat Out Solana Those who chose Solana as an alternative to the leading cryptocurrency may need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Whatever Solana does, Bitcoin will soon be able to do too. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale, and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish. Investors appear to be shifting capital toward select altcoins and high-conviction opportunities, while remaining cautious with Bitcoin .

Notably, Gautam Chhugani from Bernstein has declared that the bottom for Bitcoin has already been reached at $80,000, signaling a promising outlook for the digital asset. New Bull Run Expected In a recent note , Chhugani and his team expressed “reasonable confidence” that both Bitcoin and the broader digital asset markets have found their bottom. Concerns that the recent October peak, which surpassed $126,000, represented the absolute height of a historical four-year cycle for BTC are viewed as exaggerated by Bernstein. The firm underscores an ongoing “digital assets revolution” that is likely to prolong the current bull market. “We believe the market’s apprehension towards the four-year cycle pattern is unfounded given the current market context,” the analysts noted, highlighting that institutional demand is a significant driver of adoption in the digital asset space. Considering the momentum, Bernstein has revised its forecasts, projecting that Bitcoin will achieve $150,000 by 2026 and reach $200,000 by 2027. Is Bitcoin Preparing For A ‘Post-Bear Market Surge’? Market expert MartyParty has echoed these predictions, asserting that Bitcoin and other blue-chip cryptocurrencies are influenced heavily by liquidity, which is controlled by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Treasury. MartyParty noted that every BTC peak has historically coincided with quantitative easing (QE), while each bottom aligns with quantitative tightening (QT). With the Fed ending its QT phase on December 1 after starting it in the wake of COVID-19 in 2022, and with QE kicking off on January 1, 2026, he believes that a new bull market has commenced.

56909223,654263,1767733256,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56909223.jpeg,US DOJ Bitcoin Sales Spark Concern From US Senator,https://bitcoinist.com/us-doj-bitcoin-sales-spark-concern-from-us-senator/,bitcoinist,"US Senator Cynthia Lummis on Tuesday pushed back after reports that the US Department of Justice moved and likely sold seized Bitcoin that some lawmakers expected to be held as a national asset. According to on-chain tracking and multiple news outlets, about 57.55 BTC, roughly $6.3 million , was sent to a Coinbase Prime account and the receiving wallet later showed a zero balance, a sign the coins were probably liquidated. Senator Lummis Raises Alarm Based on reports, Senator Cynthia Lummis said she was “deeply concerned” that the transfer ran counter to a presidential directive issued earlier. The directive, Executive Order 14233 signed in March 2025, sets out a plan to create a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and calls for seized Bitcoin to be held rather than sold. Lummis, who chairs a Senate subcommittee on digital assets, questioned why seized coins were moved to an exchange custody account instead of being placed in reserve. Why is the U.S. gov still liquidating bitcoin when @POTUS explicitly directed these assets be preserved for our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? We can’t afford to squander these strategic assets while other nations are accumulating bitcoin. I’m deeply concerned about this report. https://t.co/XW5WxsfliA — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 6, 2026 On-Chain Moves Point To Sale Blockchain analysts flagged the movement after addresses tied to the seizure were traced to Coinbase Prime. Reports show the Coinbase address ended with a zero balance shortly after the transfer, which many observers read as an on-chain signal that the assets were sold. Based on reports, the transfer involved digital assets seized from defendants linked to a recent criminal case, and the US Marshals Service executed the order from the Justice Department to move the coins. Market Reaction And Numbers The market showed a small reaction around the time of the reported sale. Bitcoin’s price dipped slightly from about $94,760 to near $93,600 at one point, according to price snapshots cited by news sites. The said number of BTC is a small fraction of total circulating supply, but the trade drew attention because of the policy questions it raised and the political backdrop of a national reserve plan. Questions About Policy And The Reserve Lawmakers and crypto policy watchers now want clearer answers about when and how seized crypto is converted to cash. Reports have called for the Justice Department to explain its decision-making and to clarify whether current administration guidance requires holding seized Bitcoin for the Strategic Reserve. Senator Lummis has pushed for formal rules and possible legislation that would prevent similar sales in the future. So far, public statements from the Justice Department and the US Marshals Service have been limited in the public record, while Lummis and other proponents of the reserve have pressed for transparency. Based on reports, some legal experts argue the government has discretion over forfeited property, while others say the new executive directive should reshape that practice.

Analysts at TD Cowen warn that political dynamics in Congress, including concerns about conflicts of interest, are slowing progress, leaving crypto firms in regulatory uncertainty. Political Roadblocks Delay Crypto Regulation The crypto market structure bill, which aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S., had been expected to advance this year. However, TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group , led by managing director Jaret Seiberg, says the bill’s approval timeline is now uncertain. Political calculations tied to the 2026 midterm elections have reduced the urgency among Democrats to push the bill quickly, especially if they anticipate regaining control of the House of Representatives. Seiberg notes that the Democratic Party’s insistence on strict conflict-of-interest rules, particularly those that would prevent senior government officials and their families from operating or owning cryptocurrency businesses, is a major sticking point. This provision directly affects President Donald Trump and his family, who have reported significant crypto-related investments, including ventures in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and bitcoin mining firms. The proposed solution is to delay enforcement of these conflict-of-interest rules for three years after the bill’s enactment. This compromise would push the effective date beyond the next presidential term, potentially avoiding immediate impact on the Trump family’s crypto interests. Impact on the Crypto Industry and Market Oversight The delayed timeline means crypto firms will face ongoing regulatory uncertainty during a critical period of market growth. The bill, known as the CLARITY Act , aims to divide oversight responsibilities between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), clarifying the regulation of different digital assets. The legislation also includes provisions that could exempt certain cryptocurrencies from specific registration requirements, aiming to strike a balance between investor protection and innovation. However, the path forward remains complicated. Senate committees are scheduled to revisit the bill later this year, but overcoming procedural hurdles, such as filibusters, will require bipartisan support, which remains uncertain. Investors are advised to prepare for a protracted period of unclear regulatory conditions, which could influence where companies choose to invest and innovate. Preparing for a Shifting Regulatory Landscape Despite the delays, the crypto market remains active, with Bitcoin’s price hovering near $94,000 as of early January 2026. Still, the absence of clear rules risks slowing institutional adoption and long-term infrastructure development in the U.S. Meanwhile, the international regulatory environment continues to evolve, with regions such as the European Union and Singapore advancing their own frameworks. Industry groups like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center continue to engage with lawmakers, advocating for practical regulations that support growth and protect consumers. The upcoming January 15 congressional hearing is seen as a critical moment for clarifying legislative intent, but the overall trajectory suggests that U.S. crypto firms will face extended uncertainty before comprehensive rules take effect.

Bitcoin ($BTC) is currently trading under $94,000 after spending much of Q4 moving sideways, hinting at renewed upside momentum. Another key development has been Bitcoin’s gradual drop in market dominance since the summer . Historically, this shift often precedes capital rotation into altcoins. If the pattern repeats, assets like XRP, Dogecoin Pepe could be among the strongest performers over the next 12 months. XRP (XRP): Bringing Global Payments On Chain Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to sit at the center of blockchain-powered cross-border payments thanks to its rapid transaction speeds and low fees. Built for modern finance, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) offers a faster and more cost-efficient alternative to SWIFT. XRP’s use case has appeared in publications from institutions including the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. Backed by Ripple’s expanding fintech partnerships, XRP has become the third-largest cryptocurrency outside of stablecoins, with its market cap now above $143 billion. After resolving its long-running legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission early last year, XRP surged to a seven-year high of $3.65. It has since corrected around 35% and currently trades near $2.37. Over the past week, XRP jumped a staggering 27%, fueled by momentum from the debut of five U.S. spot XRP ETFs that have opened the door for institutional inflows. Additional approvals and clearer regulation in early 2026 could provide further upside, with some analysts targeting $10 by the end of Q1. Dogecoin (DOGE): The World’s Favourite Meme Coin Is No Longer a Laughing Matter Dogecoin ($DOGE) , launched in 2013, remains the original meme cryptocurrency and still thrives thanks to the loyalty of its “Doge Army.” Despite its playful origins, DOGE continues to maintain a market cap of over $25 billion, proof of its staying power. Its breakout run in 2021, amplified by cultural figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, turned Dogecoin into one of crypto’s most recognizable brands. Although created as a joke, Dogecoin’s large market capitalization has helped stabilize its price action, which often moves in line with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The coin briefly reached $0.30 in mid-September before cooling to around $0.15. The community’s long-standing motto, “Dogecoin to $1,” is still very much alive, though achieving that milestone in 2025 may be unrealistic without major U.S. regulatory developments. Should the Trump administration deliver on Project Crypto this month, it could catalyze a run from Dogecoin’s current price of $0.15 to $1 by Spring. Mainstream usage continues to grow. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise purchases, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut support DOGE transactions. Dogecoin’s 2021 all-time high of $0.7316 remains a distant target, with the token having depreciated by 79.4% since. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Coin Momentum Since launching in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly grown into the third-largest meme coin, powered by the enduring appeal of Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog. With a market cap approaching $3 billion, PEPE has carved out a strong cultural footprint. Interest intensified when Elon Musk briefly used a Pepe meme as his profile picture on X, fueling speculation about his connection to meme tokens. Currently trading near $0.000006848, PEPE remains about 75% below its late-2024 peak of $0.00002803, following a quieter summer and slower Q4. The token’s RSI reading near 76 suggests overbought conditions after a 69% rally in the past week. This surge lifted PEPE above key support at $0.000006. While some short-term profit-taking appears likely, the coin has consolidated well around current levels. If 2026 shapes up to be a bullish year for crypto, it could have a catalytic effect on Pepe, potentially paving the way for a fresh all-time high by the end of the quarter. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 One project gaining significant attention for 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 platform masquerading as a meme-coin. Behind the humor is a serious objective: delivering high throughput, ultra-low fees, and smart contract capability to Bitcoin. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER also features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge designed to streamline Bitcoin transfers across multiple blockchains. The presale has already generated more than $30 million, with some analysts suggesting the token could potentially post 100× gains once listed on exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed no contract vulnerabilities, greenlighting $HYPER for security-conscious investors. HYPER tokens fuel network fees, governance voting, and staking. Presale contributors can reportedly earn up to 39% APY. With the full platform set to launch in 2026, both experienced Bitcoin users and newcomers have an early-stage opportunity to engage with a project aiming to extend Bitcoin’s real-world utility.

Related Reading: Here’s Why The Shiba Inu Price Jumped Over 13% The jump coincided with a strong influx of capital into XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), technical breakout patterns, and a sharp reduction in short positions. These aspects combined to drive one of the most notable rallies in the crypto market’s early 2026 recovery phase. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP ETF Inflows and Institutional Interest Fuel Gains Spot XRP ETFs recorded $48 million in net inflows on January 5 and 6, marking the largest daily inflows since their launch in November 2024. Over the past eight weeks, these ETFs have experienced a consistent inflow of approximately $1.23 billion, reflecting a growing institutional appetite for XRP exposure. The increased buying pressure from these funds is helping absorb selling pressure and reduce the available supply on exchanges. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, noted that ETF inflows combined with XRP breaking key resistance levels on strong volume have heightened traders’ risk appetite. This institutional interest is supported by regulatory clarity following 2025’s Ripple’s settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which removed a major obstacle to adoption. Technical Breakout and Short Squeeze Accelerate Price Movement Technical analysts point to a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, with XRP maintaining levels above its 50-day moving average, a positive indicator for momentum traders. During the price surge, over $250 million in short positions were liquidated within a single hour, adding fuel to the rally by forcing short sellers to cover their bets. Renowned trader John Bollinger, inventor of the Bollinger Bands, commented that XRP is following a similar bullish pattern to Bitcoin and Ethereum but with slightly weaker momentum. Nonetheless, he suggested that XRP’s price could track Bitcoin’s upward trend, with analysts projecting a potential target near $3.50 if current support levels hold. Broader Market Context and Future Outlook XRP’s rally comes amid a broader crypto market recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum rising 7.4% and 9.3% respectively over the past week. On-chain data indicate a decline in XRP balances on centralized exchanges, suggesting reduced selling pressure. Institutional backing continues to grow, with PwC recently endorsing Ripple as a core player in blockchain-based financial services. Major banks such as Standard Chartered have projected XRP prices as high as $8 by the end of 2026, based on Ripple’s increasing integration in cross-border payments and settlement solutions. Related Reading: John Bollinger: Bitcoin BB Squeeze Breakout Targets $107,000 As market sentiment improves and regulatory uncertainties ease, XRP appears positioned to benefit from both technical momentum and growing institutional demand.

This announcement, made via social media platform X on October 26, 2024, follows a significant policy reversal by index provider MSCI Inc. The financial giant suspended its earlier proposal to exclude companies holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries from its influential global indexes. This decision marks a crucial moment for institutional adoption and validates a corporate strategy that has drawn both intense scrutiny and admiration. Michael Saylor’s MSCI Strategy and the Corporate Bitcoin Thesis Michael Saylor, the executive chairman and former CEO of MicroStrategy, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. His public statement on X served as both confirmation and commentary on a broader financial trend. Consequently, it underscores the evolving relationship between established market infrastructures and emerging asset classes. MicroStrategy, a business intelligence company, now holds a treasury reserve of over 214,000 BTC, acquired as a primary treasury asset. This bold strategy fundamentally redefined the company’s market position and investor profile. MSCI’s initial contemplation of exclusion posed a substantial risk. Index inclusion provides companies with enhanced visibility, liquidity, and access to a vast pool of passive investment capital. Therefore, removal could have triggered significant sell pressure from index-tracking funds. However, MSCI’s suspension of these plans indicates a recalibration. The firm is now acknowledging the growing institutionalization and regulatory maturation of digital assets. This shift provides critical validation for Saylor’s high-conviction approach. The MSCI Index Reversal and Its Market Impact Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) operates some of the world’s most tracked equity indexes. Funds managing trillions of dollars benchmark their performance against these indexes. The firm’s earlier proposal sent shockwaves through markets connected to public companies with crypto holdings. Its subsequent suspension, therefore, carries immense weight. This decision likely stems from several observable factors in the financial landscape. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024 established a regulated framework for institutional exposure. Accounting Standards: Improved guidance from bodies like the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on fair value accounting for crypto assets reduced reporting uncertainty. Institutional Demand: Sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs demonstrated clear, regulated demand from major financial entities. Corporate Trend: Other public companies, though none as aggressive as MicroStrategy, began exploring digital assets for treasury diversification. This context transforms MSCI’s pause from a simple policy update into a signal of mainstream financial acceptance. The impact is immediate and tangible for MicroStrategy shareholders. Continued inclusion ensures stable demand from index funds and reduces a key overhang on the stock’s valuation. Furthermore, it sets a precedent for other firms considering similar treasury strategies, lowering a perceived barrier to entry. Expert Analysis on Treasury Diversification Financial analysts and treasury management experts have long debated the merits of MicroStrategy’s strategy. Critics highlighted volatility and regulatory risk, while proponents pointed to Bitcoin’s non-correlation with traditional assets and its potential as a hedge against currency debasement. MSCI’s decision lends credence to the latter view within an institutional framework. It suggests that leading index providers now view a significant Bitcoin holding not as an automatic disqualifier, but as a strategic decision to be evaluated alongside other corporate actions. Data from MicroStrategy’s financial reports shows the strategy’s dramatic effect. The company’s market valuation now exhibits a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s price, creating a publicly-traded proxy for the digital asset. This unique position has attracted a specific investor base seeking Bitcoin exposure through equity markets. MSCI’s endorsement via continued inclusion legitimizes this hybrid investment thesis for a broader audience of traditional portfolio managers. The Road Ahead for Digital Assets in Traditional Finance The synergy between Michael Saylor’s confirmation and MSCI’s policy shift is not an endpoint. Instead, it represents a milestone in a longer integration process. The financial industry will now watch for several subsequent developments. Other major index providers like S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell may issue updated guidance. Credit rating agencies might refine their methodologies for assessing companies with crypto holdings. Finally, corporate governance standards will evolve to provide clearer frameworks for board oversight of digital asset treasuries. For MicroStrategy, the path forward involves maintaining its strategic discipline. The company must continue to navigate accounting standards, secure its digital assets, and communicate transparently with shareholders. Its success or struggle will serve as a high-profile case study for the entire corporate sector. Michael Saylor’s leadership has undoubtedly forced a conversation within traditional finance, and MSCI’s latest move shows the industry is beginning to formulate answers. Conclusion Michael Saylor’s announcement regarding MicroStrategy’s place in the MSCI index concludes a period of uncertainty for the company and its investors. More importantly, it highlights a significant inflection point for digital asset integration into global finance. MSCI’s decision to suspend exclusion plans reflects a maturing market environment with better-defined rules and growing institutional participation. This development validates the core premise of Saylor’s controversial strategy. It also provides a clearer roadmap for other corporations considering digital assets. The continued inclusion of MicroStrategy in the MSCI index signals that, for mainstream finance, Bitcoin and similar assets are transitioning from speculative outliers to components of a legitimate, if novel, corporate treasury strategy. FAQs Q1: What did Michael Saylor announce regarding the MSCI index? Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy (MSTR) will remain in the MSCI index. This statement followed an official update from MSCI Inc. suspending its earlier plans to exclude companies holding digital assets like Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. Q2: Why is inclusion in the MSCI index important for MicroStrategy? Inclusion in major indexes like MSCI is crucial because it ensures the company’s stock is held by numerous passive index funds and ETFs. This provides consistent buying pressure, enhances liquidity, and broadens the investor base, which can support the stock’s valuation. Q3: What was MSCI’s original proposal that caused concern? MSCI had previously proposed potentially excluding from its indexes any companies that held significant amounts of digital assets, such as Bitcoin, on their balance sheets. This raised the risk of forced selling by index funds if a company like MicroStrategy were removed. Q4: What factors likely influenced MSCI’s decision to suspend its exclusion plans? Key factors include the regulatory approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, improved accounting standards for crypto assets, demonstrated institutional demand, and the growing trend of corporations exploring digital assets for treasury management. Q5: What does this mean for other companies considering holding Bitcoin? MSCI’s decision lowers a significant perceived barrier. It signals to other public companies that holding Bitcoin may not automatically jeopardize their standing in major financial indexes, making the strategy more viable for a broader range of corporations.

A breakout above the $2.13 level and out of a key high-probability pattern supports a bullish XRP price prediction in the short term. Trading volumes soared by 130% in just one day, with $7.8 billion in XRP changing hands, a figure that represents 5.5% of the token’s circulating market cap. This spike signals aggressive buying interest and points to the possibility of a short squeeze unfolding. According to CoinGlass, $438 million in XRP short positions were liquidated yesterday as crypto markets roared back to life. Meanwhile, XRP’s climb pushed short liquidations to $24 million, the highest level on record since November 16 and the 6th highest short squeeze of the past 6 months. Interestingly, XRP’s gains exceeded by a long shot those of other altcoins during this same period. At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and BNB Coin (BNB) have booked 1.7%, 1.7%, and 0.9% price increases, respectively. XRP Price Prediction: Positive Momentum Accelerates as XRP Books 6-Day Winning Streak Strong inflows toward XRP-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may have played a key role in shaping the token’s latest price action. Source: TradingView Data from SoSoValue shows that the total assets managed by these vehicles have surged from $861 million to $1.2 million in just a month, while XRP ETFs have not yet booked their first day of positive net outflows since the first fund was launched in the United States. The daily chart shows that XRP has been rising for 6 days in a row now and has broken out of a bullish falling wedge pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already entering overbought territory after this strong spike, reflecting growing positive momentum. A move to $3 seems highly likely as long as the price can stay above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). As altcoins begin to recover, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will benefit from this trend. This project leverages the power of the Solana blockchain to launch the first real Bitcoin L2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises Over $30M to Kickstart a New Era for BTCFi Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings Solana’s low fees and fast transaction settlement speeds to the Bitcoin ecosystem through its highly efficient layer-2 scaling solution. BTC holders will now be able to access top DeFi applications to earn yield, stake, and lend their tokens safely and cheaply. Developers can easily deploy these dApps and no longer have to force investors to move their BTC tokens out of the Bitcoin OG blockchains to access them. As top wallets and exchanges embrace the solution, the price of its native asset, $HYPER, should rise rapidly. With $30 million in its war chest already, the Hyper L2 is rapidly moving forward with its ambitious roadmap. To buy $HYPER, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

56911737,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259167,1767743712,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"MSCI Decision: A Cautious Victory for MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy, Not a Full Policy Reversal",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/msci-decision-microstrategy-bitcoin-strategy/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld MSCI Decision: A Cautious Victory for MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy, Not a Full Policy Reversal NEW YORK, March 2025 – A recent decision by global index provider MSCI has sent ripples through the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets, offering a nuanced signal for companies like MicroStrategy. While Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer views the move as a positive development for MicroStrategy’s corporate strategy, he simultaneously cautions that it represents a temporary reprieve rather than a fundamental policy reversal. This development underscores the ongoing tension between established financial frameworks and the evolving nature of corporate Bitcoin holdings. MSCI Decision: A Positive Signal for MicroStrategy’s Strategy MSCI’s decision, as reported by CoinDesk, addresses a critical debate within institutional investing. The core issue revolves around whether companies holding significant digital assets on their balance sheets, without operating core blockchain businesses, should remain eligible for inclusion in major stock indices. For MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm that has pivoted to become a corporate Bitcoin treasury, this eligibility is paramount. Consequently, the decision to not immediately exclude such entities validates, at least temporarily, the company’s strategic argument. Analysts interpret this as MSCI acknowledging the complex financial landscape where digital assets like Bitcoin function as a novel form of corporate reserve asset. Furthermore, this development provides crucial breathing room for investors. Many institutional funds and ETFs passively track MSCI indices. An exclusion would have forced significant forced selling of MicroStrategy stock by these funds, potentially creating substantial downward pressure on its share price. Therefore, the decision maintains current index weightings and avoids immediate market disruption. However, the permanence of this status remains uncertain, casting a shadow over long-term strategic planning for similar firms. The Limits of the Move: A Temporary Reprieve, Not a Reversal Despite the positive short-term interpretation, Benchmark’s Mark Palmer provided essential context that tempers optimism. He emphasized that MSCI has explicitly stated its intention to re-evaluate the inclusion criteria for what it terms “non-operating holding companies.” This category potentially includes entities established primarily to hold Bitcoin without engaging in substantive blockchain-related operations. The distinction between an operating company with a Bitcoin treasury and a passive holding vehicle is central to MSCI’s future deliberations. This creates a significant caveat for MicroStrategy and its peers. The company must continue to demonstrate that its software business remains a viable, operational concern alongside its digital asset strategy. The timeline for MSCI’s re-evaluation remains unspecified, introducing an element of regulatory uncertainty. Market participants must now weigh the immediate benefit against the future risk of a policy shift. This scenario highlights the broader challenge for index providers in categorizing hybrid business models emerging from the digital asset revolution. Expert Analysis and Market Impact Financial analysts are scrutinizing the precedent this sets for the entire sector. The decision establishes a temporary framework but leaves the door open for future exclusion based on evolving definitions. For the market, the immediate impact is stability. MicroStrategy’s stock often trades as a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin’s price. A forced index exit would have decoupled it further, increasing volatility. Now, the correlation is likely to remain intact in the near term. Looking forward, the situation prompts several key questions. How will MSCI define “blockchain business operations” versus “digital asset holdings”? Will companies need to generate a specific percentage of revenue from blockchain services to qualify? These unanswered questions mean that while the signal is positive, the underlying strategic risk for pure-play Bitcoin holding companies has not been eliminated. The episode serves as a reminder that traditional financial infrastructure is still adapting to cryptocurrency integration, and corporate strategies must remain agile. Historical Context and the Evolution of Index Criteria Index providers like MSCI, S&P Dow Jones, and FTSE Russell periodically update their inclusion rules to reflect market evolution. Historically, similar debates occurred around companies holding large portfolios of traditional assets or operating through complex holding structures. The rise of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, pioneered by MicroStrategy starting in 2020, presents a new frontier. Initially, index providers took a cautious, observational stance. The current decision reflects a middle-ground approach. Instead of a blanket ban, MSCI is opting for a review process. This allows more time to gather data on how these corporate Bitcoin strategies perform through full market cycles and under different regulatory environments. It also lets them observe if a standardized accounting and disclosure framework emerges for digital assets. This deliberative pace is typical for large institutions managing trillions in benchmarked assets, where stability and clarity are prized above rapid innovation. The Role of Disclosure and Transparency A critical factor in MSCI’s eventual decision will likely be corporate transparency. Companies like MicroStrategy provide detailed reports on their Bitcoin purchases, holdings, and impairment charges under accounting rules. This level of disclosure may work in their favor during re-evaluation. Conversely, opaque holding structures or companies that do not provide clear audited reports on their digital assets may face greater scrutiny. The market may therefore see a divergence where transparent operators are rewarded with continued inclusion, while less clear entities are excluded, promoting better practices across the sector. Conclusion In conclusion, the MSCI decision represents a cautious, temporary victory for MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused corporate strategy. It validates the company’s argument in the short term and prevents immediate disruptive selling from index funds. However, as Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer notes, it is not a full policy reversal. The announced future re-evaluation of non-operating holding companies leaves a significant question mark over the long-term index eligibility of firms with substantial digital asset holdings. The ultimate outcome will depend on evolving definitions, market practices, and the demonstrated ability of companies to balance operational business with digital asset treasury management. For now, the market enjoys a reprieve, but the conversation about the place of Bitcoin in traditional indices is far from over. FAQs Q1: What was the key point of MSCI’s recent decision regarding companies like MicroStrategy? MSCI decided against immediately excluding companies that hold digital assets like Bitcoin from its indices, which is a positive short-term signal for MicroStrategy. However, it plans to re-evaluate the inclusion criteria for “non-operating holding companies” in the future. Q2: Why is index inclusion so important for a company like MicroStrategy? Inclusion in major indices like those from MSCI means that countless institutional funds and ETFs that passively track these indices are required to buy and hold the stock. Exclusion would force these funds to sell, potentially causing significant downward pressure on the share price. Q3: What is a “non-operating holding company” in this context? In MSCI’s context, this likely refers to a corporate entity established primarily to hold an asset like Bitcoin without engaging in substantive, revenue-generating business operations related to blockchain technology or other core services. Q4: How might MicroStrategy prove it is not just a Bitcoin holding company? MicroStrategy can point to its ongoing enterprise software business, generate audited financials separating its software operations from its Bitcoin holdings, and demonstrate how its digital asset strategy supports its overall corporate treasury and technology vision. Q5: Does this decision affect other companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet? Yes, while MicroStrategy is the largest example, this decision sets a precedent for any publicly traded company with significant Bitcoin holdings. All such firms will be subject to the same future re-evaluation by MSCI regarding their index eligibility.

56911900,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259166,1767744011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Mining Pool Foundry USA Secures Dominant 30% Market Share, Cementing Network Leadership",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/foundry-usa-bitcoin-mining-dominance/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining Pool Foundry USA Secures Dominant 30% Market Share, Cementing Network Leadership In a definitive shift for global cryptocurrency infrastructure, Foundry USA has solidified its position as the world’s premier Bitcoin mining pool, commanding a formidable 30% share of the global hashrate market. This milestone, reported by Unfolded and verified with data from The Block, underscores a rapid consolidation of mining power within the North American sector and highlights the strategic influence of institutional investment in blockchain security. The pool’s ascent to this dominant position within just five years of operation marks one of the most significant developments in Bitcoin’s recent history, fundamentally altering the geographic and economic landscape of network validation. Foundry USA’s Meteoric Rise in Bitcoin Mining Foundry USA’s journey from inception to industry leader represents a calculated expansion within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Established in 2020 as a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), one of the largest and most established investment firms in the digital asset space, Foundry was strategically positioned to leverage significant capital and industry expertise. Consequently, the pool quickly addressed a critical need for reliable, institutional-grade mining services in North America, especially following regulatory shifts in other global regions. Its growth trajectory has been remarkably steep, consistently capturing market share through strategic partnerships and large-scale hardware procurement. This expansion directly impacts Bitcoin’s network security and decentralization metrics. A mining pool aggregates the computational power of individual miners, coordinating their efforts to solve complex mathematical problems and validate transaction blocks. When a pool successfully mines a block, it distributes the block reward—newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees—among its participants based on their contributed hashrate. Foundry’s 30% share means it coordinates nearly one-third of the entire network’s processing power dedicated to this task. This concentration brings both stability and scrutiny, as the community vigilantly monitors for any single entity approaching a theoretical 51% majority, which could compromise network trust. The Strategic Backing of Digital Currency Group The role of Digital Currency Group as a parent company cannot be overstated. DCG’s portfolio includes foundational crypto enterprises like Grayscale Investments, Genesis Trading, and the news outlet CoinDesk. This ecosystem provides Foundry USA with unparalleled advantages: Capital Access: Significant financial resources for purchasing the latest ASIC mining hardware at scale. Industry Synergy: Direct connections to institutional investors, trading desks, and market intelligence. Strategic Vision: A long-term focus on building sustainable crypto infrastructure rather than short-term profit extraction. This backing enabled Foundry to launch during a pivotal moment. Following China’s 2021 crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, which saw a massive exodus of hashrate, North America emerged as a new hub. Foundry aggressively filled this vacuum, providing a reliable and compliant home for displaced miners and new entrants alike. Its growth, therefore, is intertwined with a broader geographic redistribution of Bitcoin mining towards jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks and stable energy grids. Implications for Bitcoin Network Security and Decentralization The concentration of hashrate is a perennial topic of analysis within the Bitcoin community. A highly decentralized distribution of mining power is considered ideal for maximizing network resilience against coercion or attack. Foundry USA’s current market share, while significant, sits below the critical threshold that would raise immediate security concerns. However, its dominance does influence network dynamics in several tangible ways. Firstly, it enhances the predictability and stability of block discovery times. Large, professionally managed pools contribute to a consistent hashrate, which helps keep the average time between blocks close to Bitcoin’s target of 10 minutes. Secondly, Foundry’s operations are subject to public scrutiny and regulatory oversight in the United States, potentially increasing transparency compared to pools operating in less regulated environments. This can be viewed as a net positive for institutional adoption, as it aligns with compliance expectations. Nevertheless, analysts continuously monitor the distribution of power. The health of the mining ecosystem is often measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a common gauge of market concentration. The following table illustrates the recent competitive landscape among top pools: Mining Pool Estimated Global Hashrate Share Primary Jurisdiction Foundry USA 30% United States AntPool ~22% Global F2Pool ~13% Global ViaBTC ~11% Global Binance Pool ~6% Global This data shows that while Foundry leads, competition remains robust. The presence of several other major pools helps maintain a balanced and competitive market. Furthermore, miners can and do switch pools relatively easily based on fee structures, payout reliability, and personal preference, which acts as a natural check on any single pool’s influence. The Economic and Environmental Context of Modern Mining Foundry’s dominance coincides with the industry’s increasing focus on sustainable energy and economic efficiency. The pool has been actively involved in initiatives supporting the use of stranded energy, such as flared natural gas, and has invested in operations tied to renewable sources. This focus addresses one of the most common external critiques of Bitcoin mining—its energy consumption—by pushing the industry towards a greener profile. From an economic standpoint, controlling 30% of the network hashrate translates to significant influence over the procurement and development of mining hardware. Foundry’s bulk purchasing power can affect global supply chains for ASIC chips and even influence the R&D priorities of manufacturers like Bitmain and MicroBT. The Future Landscape of Global Hashrate Distribution Looking ahead, the trajectory of Foundry USA and the broader mining sector will be shaped by several key factors. Regulatory developments in the United States and other major jurisdictions will play a crucial role. Clear, fair regulation can provide stability that favors large, compliant operators like Foundry. Conversely, overly restrictive policies could push hashrate to other regions. Secondly, the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price and the impending halving events—which periodically reduce the block reward—will test the economic model of all mining operations. Pools with strong financial backing and efficient operations are best positioned to weather these cycles. Technological innovation will also be a driver. Advances in chip efficiency, cooling solutions, and energy management directly impact profitability. As a leader, Foundry is likely to be at the forefront of adopting these technologies, potentially widening its efficiency advantage. Finally, the ongoing geographic diversification of mining is a positive trend for network resilience. While North America, led by pools like Foundry, is now a central hub, growing sectors in regions like the Middle East, Central Asia, and Latin America will contribute to a more globally distributed and robust network in the long term. Conclusion Foundry USA’s achievement of a 30% global share of the Bitcoin mining pool market is a landmark event that reflects the maturation and institutionalization of cryptocurrency infrastructure. Backed by Digital Currency Group, its rise was strategically timed to capitalize on a shifting global landscape, providing essential stability and services to the network. While its market share warrants ongoing observation to ensure the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin is preserved, its current dominance also brings professional management, regulatory alignment, and a focus on sustainable growth. The evolution of this leading Bitcoin mining pool will remain a critical narrative for network security, energy usage, and the broader adoption of digital assets worldwide. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Foundry USA has a 30% market share? It means that Foundry USA coordinates approximately 30% of the total computational power (hashrate) used to secure the Bitcoin network and validate transactions. Miners connected to Foundry contribute their hardware to the pool, and the pool distributes rewards when it successfully mines a new block. Q2: Is a 30% share a risk to Bitcoin’s decentralization? While 30% is a significant concentration, it is below the 51% threshold that would theoretically enable a double-spend attack. The Bitcoin community monitors such metrics closely. The presence of other large competing pools and the ease with which miners can switch pools help mitigate centralization risks. Q3: How did Foundry USA grow so quickly? Its rapid growth is attributed to strong capital backing from its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), strategic timing after China’s mining ban, a focus on the North American market, and providing reliable, institutional-grade services to miners during a period of high demand. Q4: How does Foundry USA’s dominance affect individual Bitcoin miners? For individual miners, joining a large pool like Foundry USA typically means more frequent, smaller payouts, reducing the variance of solo mining. However, it also means miners are subject to the pool’s fee structure and operational policies. Competition among large pools generally keeps fees low and services competitive. Q5: What is the difference between a mining pool and a mining company? A mining pool is a service that aggregates the hashrate of many participants (who may be individuals or companies) to increase the chance of earning block rewards. A mining company, like some of Foundry’s clients, owns and operates its own mining hardware. That company may choose to point its hardware at Foundry’s pool to participate in their collective effort.

Interestingly, this recent push is more than just a bounce, especially as a longer-term chart structure shows comparisons with XRP’s behavior ahead of its 2017 breakout. How The 2017 Structure Unfolded Before The Surge Technical analysis of XRP’s current price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency is currently tracing out a similar price action to what it went through back in 2017 on the 3-day chart. In that earlier period, price action unfolded through a well-defined five-wave sequence, characterized by alternating phases of decline and recovery. Waves one, three, and five each pushed the price lower with corrective pressure, while waves two and four produced temporary rebounds that relieved selling pressure but failed to establish a lasting trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Parabola: What’s Different Between The Last Bull Cycle And This One? The final stage of that sequence was particularly important. During the fifth wave, XRP’s decline slowed and compressed into a falling wedge formation. XRP’s price slipped below the $0.005 level and eventually stabilized around $0.00485, where downside follow-through became increasingly limited. From here, the downside pressure gradually weakened, volatility contracted, and selling momentum faded. When XRP finally broke out of that compression, it quickly reclaimed the $0.008 zone and broke through $0.02, resulting in the start of a rally that ultimately delivered gains well in excess of 1,000%. XRP Price Chart. Source: @Steph_iscrypto According to Steph’s analysis, XRP’s recent price action is following a remarkably similar rhythm. After topping out around $3.40 in mid-2025, the cryptocurrency entered a corrective phase that pushed the price steadily lower to create a falling wedge structure. That decline found support at $1.74, where selling pressure slowed and price action stopped making aggressive new lows. Now, it seems XRP is breaking out of the falling wedge and back to solidifying its price action above $2. XRP Price Action In Focus Now that XRP is back to trading above $2 and above the falling wedge, the next course of action is to look at how the price behaves from here. Of course, the most bullish course of action is for XRP to repeat a 1,000% rally, which would place it at a price target around $22. Related Reading: Popular Crypto Founder Dumps Millions In Ethereum, Here’s What He’s Buying In terms of how this plays out, there are resistance levels to watch out for. The $2.30 area is an early test, followed by $2.50 and $2.80, which are prior consolidation levels where XRP slowed down during its push to all-time highs in 2025. After that, the $3.10 price level and the previous 2018 high at $3.40 are the major resistances that would need to be reclaimed. On the downside, sustained weakness below $1.90, and especially a move back toward $1.74, would challenge the idea that the corrective phase has fully played out.

56911921,654337,1767744036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56911921.jpeg,Ethereum Ready To Breakout Against Bitcoin – Analyst Reveals When To Sell,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-ready-to-breakout/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing renewed momentum after recovering and rising by more than 7% in the past week. As bearish trends slowly reverse, a crypto analyst has shared a detailed analysis of the ETH/BTC chart , predicting the trading pair’s next moves. The analysis highlights key upside targets and identifies a specific sell zone, signaling when traders may consider taking profits. Ethereum Approaches Key Sell Zone Against Bitcoin Crypto market technician John Carter has illustrated a bullish setup for the ETH/BTC pair in one of his latest chart analyses on X. According to Carter, Ethereum is reaching a critical decision point against Bitcoin, with price hovering near an important technical level within a Broadening Wedge pattern. The setup points to a potential breakout, highlighting a clearly defined resistance zone where selling pressure is expected to emerge. Notably, Carter has stated that Ethereum is currently approaching the upper boundary of the long-term Broadening Wedge on the weekly chart. This structure has guided Ethereum’s performance relative to BTC for several years, with prices expanding between widening trendlines. Recently, ETH/BTC bounced from the lower support zone of the Broadening Wedge, confirming that buyers are defending that level. The rebound from support was sharp and well defined, and after touching the lower boundary of the wedge, the pair launched a strong recovery leg . This upward move pushed the price back into the upper half of the wedge, setting ETH/BTC on a direct path toward resistance. According to Carter, ETH/BTC is now completing its final phase of consolidation within the wedge. As a result, breakout signals are emerging as price tightens near resistance, and the trading pair holds higher lows. If ETH/BTC confirms a breakout above the wedge’s upper boundary, Carter predicts that it will climb to an initial target of $0.041, aligning with a previous consolidation area. Beyond that, price could advance upward $0.051 and $0.060. The final upside target has been set at $0.081, which overlaps with the broader resistance zone on the chart. The analyst marks this resistance as a sell zone , showing when traders can begin taking profit. Analyst Outlines Critical Support Levels For ETH/BTC In his analysis, Carter also identified several support zones that could act as key defense levels if Ethereum faces a pullback against Bitcoin. The first major support zone lies near the upper boundary of the Broadening Wedge pattern, around $0.031. Below that, the analyst has pinpointed another support level at $0.026. If the price falls below $0.026, the next notable support is around $0.022, representing a roughly 35% decline from current levels above $0.034. In the event of an even deeper correction, Carter forecasts that ETH/BTC could drop to $0.0185, a level marked on the chart as the Broadening Wedge’s “support zone.” Any move below this support would likely push ETH/BTC toward the lower boundary of the wedge, which extends down to $0.010.",Ethereum|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This move eased significant market uncertainty for the Bitcoin-heavy company and others in the sector. Following the announcement, Strategy’s stock climbed approximately 5%–6% in after-hours trading, according to market data — a roughly 5.7% increase, as referenced by analysts tracking the reaction. MSCI shared a note dated Tuesday, highlighting that digital asset treasury companies (DATCOs) will participate in an extensive discussion that will enable them to effectively distinguish between investment firms and businesses that hold digital assets as a crucial part of their operation. The American finance company further stated that, “This broader review aims to maintain consistency and ensure alignment with the overall goals of the MSCI Indexes, which focus on measuring the performance of operating companies while excluding entities whose main activities are investment-related.” MSCI embraces and adopts a massive plan in its operation After several considerations, reports revealed that MSCI decided to classify DATCOs as firms where digital assets comprise around 50% or more of their total assets. Notably, the inclusion of DATs in this situation assures the companies continue to qualify for passive index funds . These funds are essential for their operations, as they help companies maintain stable demand and liquidity while increasing institutional ownership of digital assets. On the other hand, sources claimed that if, by any chance, DATs are excluded from this broader picture, then Strategy and other DATs could face substantial losses worth billions, especially in passive capital inflows. Following this announcement, data from Google Finance indicated that the largest crypto treasury company, Strategy, which holds approximately $63 billion in Bitcoin, experienced a considerable rise of around 5.7% in its shares after-hours trading. Analysts also weighed in on the topic of discussion. They acknowledged that the development of DATs was established as a worldwide trend, specifically among institutions in 2024 and 2025. However, many individuals revealed facing sharp declines in the price of their shares in the second half of 2025. This scenario sparked concerns in the ecosystem as many began questioning the sustainability of such strategies. Morgan Stanley decided to explore the crypto market As uncertainties surrounding the crypto industry continue to escalate, recent reports have disclosed that US investment bank Morgan Stanley has successfully submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting permission from the agency to develop two cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Sources close to the situation, who wished to remain anonymous, pointed out that one fund is intended to concentrate on Bitcoin, while the other will primarily focus on Solana. Interestingly, apart from the growing uncertainties in the crypto industry, analysts discovered that this significant milestone comes at a time when Wall Street companies are considering alternatives in regulated digital asset products. Meanwhile, documents filed with the SEC on Tuesday, January 6, highlighted that the planned Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and Morgan Stanley Solana Trust will function as passive investment tools that can effectively hold and closely track the value of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the documents revealed that these two funds aim to ensure their shares are listed on public exchanges, which are typically detailed in later 19b-4 filings rather than the initial S-1 forms.

Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Drop to 23 The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market health indicator. Consequently, its recent decline from 26 to 23 provides a clear signal. This metric operates on a simple yet powerful premise. Specifically, an altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets, outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day rolling window. Therefore, a score of 23 sits far from the 100-point threshold, firmly indicating a Bitcoin season. This measurement offers investors an objective, data-driven view of market rotation. Understanding Cryptocurrency Market Cycles Cryptocurrency markets historically move in distinct cycles. Typically, Bitcoin leads major bull runs, attracting institutional and macroeconomic capital. Subsequently, capital and investor sentiment often rotate into alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, which can experience exponential gains. This phase is popularly termed ‘altcoin season.’ The current index reading of 23, however, suggests this rotation has not materialized. Instead, capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin, a phenomenon often linked to macroeconomic uncertainty or anticipation of Bitcoin-specific catalysts like ETF inflows or regulatory clarity. Historical Context and Expert Analysis Market analysts frequently examine past index behavior for context. For instance, during the 2021 bull market, the index repeatedly breached the 75 level. Conversely, prolonged periods below 25 have often coincided with Bitcoin dominance climbing above 55%. This pattern suggests that the current low index is not an anomaly but part of a recognizable market structure. Experts from firms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant often correlate these phases with on-chain data, noting that low altcoin index readings frequently align with reduced exchange inflows for altcoins and increased Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders. The Mechanics and Calculation Behind the Index The index’s methodology is transparent and rules-based. It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, it filters out stablecoins like USDT and USDC, as well as wrapped assets like WBTC, which simply mirror Bitcoin’s price. This ensures the metric reflects genuine altcoin performance. The calculation involves a direct 90-day performance comparison against Bitcoin for each asset. The percentage of assets outperforming Bitcoin is then translated into the index score. This process eliminates subjective bias, providing a pure momentum indicator. Key components of the index include: Timeframe: A rolling 90-day window ensures the data captures medium-term trends, not short-term volatility. Asset Selection: Focus on the top 100 excludes micro-cap projects, focusing on established altcoins with significant liquidity. Exclusion Criteria: Removing stablecoins and wrapped tokens prevents skewing the data with non-volatile or derivative assets. Implications for Investors and Traders in 2025 A low Altcoin Season Index carries direct implications for market participants. Primarily, it suggests that diversification into altcoins may currently underperform a Bitcoin-focused strategy. For long-term investors, this phase might represent an accumulation period for select altcoins at lower valuations relative to Bitcoin. For active traders, momentum strategies favoring Bitcoin over altcoins are likely more effective. Furthermore, this environment often sees sector-specific rotations, where capital flows into Bitcoin-related projects or infrastructure rather than broad-based altcoin rallies. Comparative Market Data Table The following table contrasts key metrics during different Altcoin Season Index phases, based on historical aggregated data: Index Phase Typical Bitcoin Dominance Average Altcoin ROI (90-day) Common Market Sentiment > 75 (Altcoin Season) Below 45% +150% to +400% High risk appetite, speculative 40 – 75 (Transition) 45% – 55% +20% to +80% Cautious optimism, selective Above 55% -20% to +30% Risk-off, defensive, macro-focused Broader Market Impact and Ecosystem Effects The prevailing Bitcoin season impacts the entire blockchain ecosystem. Notably, developer activity and venture funding in non-Bitcoin sectors may experience slower growth during these periods. Conversely, Bitcoin layer-2 networks, ordinals, and other Bitcoin-centric innovations often gain heightened attention. Network metrics, such as Ethereum gas fees or Solana transaction volumes, may see subdued activity compared to periods of altcoin strength. This dynamic underscores Bitcoin’s role as the market’s foundational reserve asset, especially during times of broader financial uncertainty. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index reading of 23 delivers a unambiguous message about current market structure. It confirms a dominant Bitcoin season where capital preservation and core asset accumulation take precedence over altcoin speculation. This phase, while challenging for altcoin portfolios, forms a natural part of cryptocurrency market cycles. Monitoring this index, alongside on-chain data and macroeconomic indicators, remains essential for navigating the 2025 landscape. Ultimately, the index provides a vital, neutral framework for assessing when the next significant rotation toward altcoins may begin. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 23 mean? An index score of 23 means only a small fraction of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It strongly indicates a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where Bitcoin is the dominant market performer. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The index calculates the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) that have outperformed Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. This percentage becomes the index score. Q3: What is the threshold for an official ‘altcoin season’? An official altcoin season is declared when the index reaches or exceeds 75. This signifies that at least 75% of the qualifying altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the preceding quarter. Q4: Does a low index mean altcoins are a bad investment? Not necessarily. A low index suggests relative underperformance compared to Bitcoin in the short-to-medium term. It can sometimes present accumulation opportunities for long-term investors, but it indicates weaker current momentum. Q5: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates daily, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling performance data. This allows investors to track the gradual strengthening or weakening of altcoin momentum relative to Bitcoin.

This substantial transfer, reported by Onchain Lens, immediately captures market attention due to its potential implications for Bitcoin’s liquidity and price trajectory. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the flow for signals about institutional sentiment and potential selling pressure in the digital asset markets. Analyzing the MARA Holdings Bitcoin Deposit to FalconX The core transaction involves a precise movement of 519.46 BTC. Blockchain analytics firms like Onchain Lens track these movements by monitoring wallet addresses associated with major entities. Deposits to exchanges like FalconX often precede selling activity because traders typically move assets to trading platforms to execute sell orders. However, alternative explanations exist, including collateralization for loans or preparations for over-the-counter (OTC) trades. The sheer size of this deposit, equivalent to $48.3 million, underscores its potential market impact. Furthermore, understanding this event requires context about the involved parties. MARA Holdings is a known entity within the cryptocurrency mining and investment sector. FalconX, conversely, operates as a prime brokerage and trading platform catering primarily to institutional clients. This context suggests the transaction likely represents strategic institutional activity rather than retail investor behavior. The market now watches for subsequent on-chain movements or official statements from either party. The Critical Role of On-Chain Data in Crypto Markets Transactions like this highlight the growing importance of on-chain analytics. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrency transactions are publicly recorded on blockchains. This transparency allows firms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Onchain Lens to provide real-time insights into holder behavior. Key metrics derived from such data include: Exchange Net Flow: The net difference between assets moving onto and off of exchanges. Entity-Adjusted Metrics: Data clustered by known wallets to filter out internal exchange movements. Whale Transaction Count: The number of large-value transactions exceeding a certain threshold. For instance, a sustained trend of positive exchange inflow (more deposits than withdrawals) can signal increasing selling intent. The MARA Holdings deposit contributes directly to this metric for FalconX and the broader market. Analysts will now cross-reference this single event with aggregate data to assess whether it is an outlier or part of a larger trend. Institutional Strategy and Market Impact Scenarios Interpreting a large deposit requires examining possible strategic motives. Institutional players like MARA Holdings do not act on whims; their moves are calculated. Several plausible scenarios exist for this $48.3 million transfer. First, the entity may intend to sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to secure fiat currency for operational expenses, such as expanding mining infrastructure or covering energy costs. Second, the Bitcoin could serve as collateral for a dollar-denominated loan through FalconX’s credit services, a common practice for unlocking liquidity without triggering a taxable sale. A third scenario involves preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) desk trade. OTC trades facilitate large transactions without immediately impacting the public order book on spot exchanges. If this deposit precedes an OTC deal, the market impact would be more muted than a direct market sell order. The timeline of subsequent wallet activity will be crucial. If the Bitcoin moves from the FalconX deposit wallet to a known cold storage address quickly, it may negate the selling hypothesis. The table below outlines these potential scenarios and their likely market effects. Scenario Description Potential Market Impact Direct Market Sale BTC is sold via limit/market orders on FalconX’s exchange. High. Adds immediate sell-side pressure, potentially lowering price. Collateral for Loan BTC is used as backing for a fiat loan facility. Low/Neutral. BTC is locked as collateral, not sold. OTC Trade Preparation BTC is positioned for a private, bilateral trade. Moderate. Large sale occurs off-exchange, with indirect price effects. Internal Rebalancing Transfer between accounts or sub-entities within the same firm. Negligible. No net change in market supply. Historical precedent offers guidance. For example, similar large exchange deposits by mining companies in Q2 2022 often preceded periods of increased volatility and price declines. However, in Q4 2023, some large deposits were later revealed to be for collateral purposes ahead of bullish positioning. Therefore, while the deposit is a notable signal, it is not a definitive predictor without corroborating evidence from order book depth, derivatives market funding rates, and broader macroeconomic conditions. Broader Context: Bitcoin Mining Economics and Holder Behavior MARA Holdings operates within the competitive Bitcoin mining industry. Mining economics directly influence holder behavior. Miners face constant operational costs, primarily electricity. They often must sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin to cover these expenses. The decision to sell is influenced by Bitcoin’s price, network difficulty, and the company’s treasury management strategy. A $48.3 million deposit could represent the accumulation of several months’ worth of mined rewards, now being deployed strategically. Moreover, public mining companies face quarterly reporting requirements and shareholder expectations. Managing their Bitcoin treasury is a critical part of their financial strategy. Selling during perceived market strength can bolster balance sheets. Conversely, holding through volatility demonstrates long-term conviction. This specific action by MARA Holdings will be compared to recent activity from other public miners like Riot Platforms and CleanSpark to identify sector-wide trends. Are miners collectively becoming net sellers, or is this an isolated corporate decision? Expert Perspectives on Exchange Flow Interpretation Leading on-chain analysts consistently advise against overreacting to single transactions. “While large deposits are a necessary condition for selling, they are not sufficient proof,” notes a pseudonymous analyst from CryptoQuant. “We always look for confirmation in other metrics, such as the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and the behavior of long-term holders.” The SOPR indicates whether coins moved are being sold at a profit or loss, adding emotional context to the transaction. Additionally, the destination matters. FalconX’s clientele is institutional. A deposit there carries different connotations than a deposit to a retail-focused exchange like Binance or Coinbase. Institutional flows can be more methodical and less reactive to short-term price swings. Therefore, this event may reflect a planned treasury reallocation rather than a panic-driven decision. The coming weeks will provide more data points, such as whether the Bitcoin remains in FalconX’s hot wallet or is distributed to other addresses. Conclusion The deposit of 519.46 BTC by MARA Holdings to FalconX represents a significant on-chain event worthy of market attention. This $48.3 million Bitcoin transfer serves as a key data point for analysts interpreting institutional sentiment and potential selling pressure. However, definitive conclusions require patience and analysis of follow-on activity. The move underscores the critical importance of sophisticated on-chain analytics in the modern cryptocurrency landscape. Market participants should monitor exchange net flows, miner wallet activity, and broader macroeconomic indicators to properly contextualize this single transaction within the complex tapestry of digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: What does a large Bitcoin deposit to an exchange typically mean? Typically, it signals potential selling intent, as users move assets to trading platforms to execute sell orders. However, it can also indicate preparations for using Bitcoin as loan collateral or for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Q2: Who is MARA Holdings? MARA Holdings is an entity involved in cryptocurrency mining and investment. It is known for its significant Bitcoin treasury holdings and operations within the digital asset ecosystem. Q3: What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime brokerage and trading platform that serves institutional clients, offering exchange services, credit, and OTC trading desks. Q4: How do analysts track these transactions? Analysts use on-chain data platforms like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, and CryptoQuant. These tools cluster wallet addresses by entity and track the flow of funds to and from known exchange wallets. Q5: Does this deposit guarantee the Bitcoin will be sold? No, it does not guarantee a sale. While it increases the possibility, the Bitcoin could be used for other purposes like collateralization. The key is to watch if the coins are subsequently moved to a known cold storage wallet or if sell-side pressure materializes on the order book. Q6: What other data should I watch after this news? Monitor overall Bitcoin exchange net flow, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), funding rates in perpetual futures markets, and public statements or SEC filings from MARA Holdings for further context.

The recovery comes after a prolonged period of selling pressure and uncertainty, and it has reignited bullish expectations among a segment of investors who now believe XRP could challenge or even surpass its all-time high later this year. While skepticism remains across the broader market, price action suggests that XRP is no longer purely defensive. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows According to a recent CryptoQuant report, early January brought visible improvement across the crypto sector, with Bitcoin pushing toward $93,000 and XRP moving decisively above $2.30. That synchronized strength helped shift sentiment, as XRP broke out of its prior consolidation range and began showing signs of renewed trend formation. Significantly, the move has not been driven by price alone. On-chain data points to a deeper structural change within the XRP ecosystem. Activity on the XRP Ledger has accelerated sharply, with network growth reaching levels not seen during the previous consolidation phase. This expansion suggests that rising prices are being supported by genuine usage and participation rather than short-term speculation. XRPL Liquidity Surge Signals Structural Shift Behind Breakout The CryptoQuant report indicates a decisive change in XRP’s market structure, driven not only by price appreciation but also by deep shifts in liquidity and participation. One of the most striking developments is the explosion in liquidity on the XRPL decentralized exchange, which has climbed to roughly $173 billion. Rather than thinning out during periods of weakness, liquidity has expanded sharply, suggesting that large players are actively positioning rather than exiting. This behavior is typically associated with preparation for heightened volatility or a more durable trend change. The timing of this expansion is also important. Since mid-December, liquidity spikes have become both more frequent and larger in size, a pattern that aligns with the entry of more sophisticated market makers. This effectively transforms the trading environment, making it easier for whales and institutional participants to deploy size without causing disruptive price swings. In practical terms, XRP is becoming a more efficient market for large-scale capital. Crucially, this liquidity is not idle. Transaction activity on the XRPL DEX has surged, indicating that deeper order books are supporting real usage rather than passive positioning. At the same time, market behavior has shifted toward buyer dominance. Aggressive buying has taken control, while bearish pressure has faded, allowing the price to break out of its prior compression. Forced short covering further reinforced that move and helped propel XRP through key resistance near $2.30. Together, these dynamics suggest that structural improvements, not just speculative momentum, underpin XRP’s recent strength. Related Reading: Memecoin Strength Returns After Historic Market Decline: A Setup For A Comeback? XRP Faces Heavy Overhead Resistance XRP’s daily chart shows a notable shift in short-term momentum after a prolonged period of downside pressure. Price has surged from the December lows near the $1.85–$1.90 zone and is now trading around $2.35, marking a sharp recovery that has caught sellers off guard. Following months of lower highs and lower lows, analysts view this rebound as an early trend reversal attempt instead of a confirmed bullish continuation The breakout above the short-term moving average (blue line) is a constructive development. This level had previously acted as dynamic resistance throughout November and December, consistently rejecting upside attempts. Reclaiming it signals improving momentum and a potential shift in market structure. However, XRP is now approaching a dense resistance cluster between $2.45 and $2.65, where both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages converge. Historically, this zone has attracted strong selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K While the recent rally shows increased participation compared to late December, it remains well below the levels seen during prior impulsive advances. This suggests that although buyers are regaining control, conviction is still developing. A period of consolidation above $2.20 would help solidify this move. If XRP can hold above the $2.30–$2.35 area, the probability of a broader recovery toward $2.70 increases. Failure to do so would likely result in a pullback, keeping XRP range-bound and vulnerable to renewed selling pressure.

56915426,654297,1767751241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56915426.jpeg,Binance Liquidity Structure Mirrors Bitcoin Market Conditions Seen Before Previous Rallies – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-liquidity-mirrors-previous-bitcoin-rallies/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin is trading comfortably above the $90,000 level and is now attempting to reclaim the $94,000 zone, offering the market a sense of relief after weeks of tight consolidation and persistent sell-side pressure. While broader sentiment remains cautious, recent price stability suggests that downside momentum has slowed, allowing buyers to re-enter with more confidence. According to a recent analysis by Darkfost, one of the most relevant indicators to track in this environment is the Bitcoin-to-stablecoin ratio on Binance. This metric provides a direct view into the amount of potential buying power sitting on the exchange, which continues to host a dominant share of centralized exchange liquidity. When stablecoins represent a larger portion of the ratio, it implies that capital is sidelined and ready to be deployed if conditions improve. Current readings point to a constructive setup. Despite recent price gains, stablecoin balances remain elevated relative to Bitcoin holdings, suggesting that the rally has not been driven by exhaustion of buying power. Instead, it indicates that liquidity is still available to support further moves if confidence continues to build. While this does not guarantee an immediate breakout, it reduces the risk of a sharp reversal. As long as Bitcoin holds above key psychological levels, the presence of undeployed capital may act as a stabilizing force in the near term. Stablecoin Reserves Suggest Latent Buying Power Darkfost’s analysis highlights an important nuance behind Bitcoin’s recent rebound. Although BTC has rallied roughly $8,000 over the past week—supported by a near $4 billion expansion in open interest—the Bitcoin-to-stablecoin ratio on Binance continues to send a notably constructive signal. In previous cycles, sharp price recoveries were often accompanied by an immediate drawdown in stablecoin reserves. That is not what is happening now.’ A similar setup last appeared during the March 2025 correction, when Bitcoin fell from $109,000 to $74,000. At that time, the ratio remained compressed before reversing higher, a move that preceded a strong expansion phase and a push toward new all-time highs near $126,000. The current structure closely resembles that period. At present, the ratio is still hovering around the 1 level following a pronounced contraction. This implies that stablecoins account for a relatively large share of exchange balances. Data shows that stablecoin reserves grew by roughly $1 billion as prices fell, either through defensive positioning or fresh capital entering the platform. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s USD value declined, mechanically increasing the purchasing power of those reserves. What stands out now is the early turn higher in the ratio. If sustained, this shift may signal the gradual deployment of sidelined liquidity rather than speculative exhaustion. In practical terms, it suggests that the market may be transitioning from capital preservation to selective risk re-engagement, a dynamic that often supports further upside if price structure confirms. Bitcoin Attempts Recovery Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin is currently trading near the $93,800 level after bouncing from December lows around the mid-$80,000s, signaling a short-term relief phase following weeks of heavy selling pressure. The chart shows a clear rebound from the local bottom, with price reclaiming horizontal support near $92,000–$93,000, an area that previously acted as resistance during the breakdown. This level now represents a critical pivot for market structure in the near term. Despite the recovery, Bitcoin remains below its declining short-term and mid-term moving averages. The blue moving average (short-term) is still sloping downward and acting as immediate dynamic resistance, while the green and red longer-term averages remain overhead, reinforcing a broader corrective structure. Until price can reclaim and hold above these levels—particularly the zone between $97,000 and $100,000—the move should be viewed as corrective rather than trend-confirming. While selling pressure has eased compared to the capitulation phase seen in late November and early December, the rebound has not been accompanied by a decisive surge in volume. This suggests that buyers are selective rather than aggressive, consistent with a market in stabilization rather than expansion. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming a short-term higher low, which reduces immediate downside risk. However, the broader trend remains vulnerable. A failure to hold above $92,000 could reopen the path toward range continuation, while a clean break above the descending moving averages would be required to shift momentum decisively back in favor of the bulls.

XRP has been among the beneficiaries of this rebound , recording a steady climb since the start of the year. After opening 2026 near the $1.84 level, the token has since advanced to highs around $2.41, reflecting improving sentiment and stronger short-term momentum. Within this context, well-known market commentator Mario Nawfal has shared his outlook on where XRP and other large-cap cryptocurrencies could realistically trade if current conditions persist. Unlike speculative forecasts that rely on extreme assumptions, Nawfal framed his projections as achievable outcomes rather than aspirational scenarios. Nawfal’s Price Expectations for XRP and Major Cryptocurrencies In a recent post, Nawfal identified $4 as a reasonable price objective for XRP. Alongside this, he outlined expectations for other leading assets, including Bitcoin at $145,000, Ethereum at $7,000, and Solana at $500. Realistic numbers I’d like to see: Bitcoin → $145k Ethereum → $7k Solana → $500 XRP → $4 Am I crazy, or does this look achievable? — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) January 5, 2026 He emphasized that these figures represent what he considers attainable levels within the current market cycle, assuming continued participation from institutional and retail investors. For XRP, the $4 level holds historical relevance. The token reached a peak of $3.84 during the 2018 bull market and came close to revisiting that range in July 2025, when it surged to $3.65 before losing momentum. That rally ultimately stalled as broader market conditions weakened, leading to a notable correction. However, XRP’s renewed strength in early 2026 has prompted analysts like Nawfal to revisit the possibility of a return to that zone. From its recent trading price near $2.35 , XRP would need to rise by approximately two-thirds to reach $4. Achieving that level would also push its market capitalization to roughly $240 billion, placing it firmly among the largest digital assets globally. Historical Performance and Market Constraints Supporters of Nawfal’s outlook point to XRP’s history of sharp price expansions as evidence that a move of this scale is not unprecedented. In late 2024, the token recorded a rally exceeding 400% within a relatively short period. Against that backdrop, a move under 70% appears comparatively moderate. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That said, analysts also acknowledge that XRP faces meaningful technical barriers. Price zones around $3 have repeatedly acted as resistance, and sustained buying pressure would be required to overcome these levels. As a result, while the $4 target is viewed by some as achievable, it may not be reached without periods of consolidation or temporary pullbacks. Mixed Reactions From the Analyst Community Nawfal’s projections have generated varied responses. Some market observers, including figures such as Zach Rector, have suggested XRP could revisit its mid-2025 highs if favourable conditions continue. Others remain more cautious, arguing that XRP’s volatility and past reversals warrant tempered expectations, even as they agree with Nawfal’s outlook for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP’s Current Market Position In the short term, XRP has distinguished itself as one of the strongest performers among large-cap cryptocurrencies. Recent data shows it leading the top ten assets in daily gains, with double-digit advances that exceed those of most peers. Weekly performance has also remained robust, reinforcing the perception that XRP is benefiting from renewed accumulation and broader market recovery. Some investors attribute this strength to tightening supply conditions, as XRP continues to be absorbed through exchange-traded products and corporate treasury strategies. While these factors do not guarantee sustained appreciation, they contribute to the growing belief that XRP’s current rally could have room to extend. Overall, Nawfal’s $4 projection reflects a cautious optimism grounded in market history, current momentum, and realistic growth assumptions rather than speculative extremes.

According to fresh on-chain analysis, the flagship digital asset’s failure to close above $94,000 could trigger significant liquidations and a sharp correction toward $85,000. This Bitcoin price analysis comes amid unprecedented institutional flows and whale activity that suggests heightened market volatility ahead. Bitcoin Price Analysis Reveals Critical Juncture Bitcoin currently trades within a narrow resistance zone between $92,000 and $94,000, creating tension among traders and analysts. The market’s inability to decisively break through this barrier reflects underlying selling pressure despite favorable technical indicators. CryptoOnchain, a prominent contributor to the analytics platform CryptoQuant, recently published detailed findings about this market situation. Their Bitcoin price analysis incorporates multiple data streams to provide comprehensive market intelligence. Technical indicators present a mixed picture for Bitcoin’s immediate future. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator measuring price movement speed and change, currently favors buyers. However, this bullish signal conflicts with concerning on-chain data. Specifically, substantial cryptocurrency inflows to major exchanges suggest potential selling pressure. This divergence between technical and on-chain signals creates uncertainty for market participants. Whale Movements Signal Potential Market Shift Recent blockchain data reveals significant whale activity that could impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Over the past seven days, approximately $4.75 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum flowed into Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This substantial movement typically indicates two possible scenarios: whales preparing to sell their holdings or establishing short positions against current prices. Both possibilities suggest bearish sentiment among large investors despite Bitcoin’s recent price appreciation. The concentration of cryptocurrency on exchanges increases selling pressure for several reasons. First, exchange-held assets become immediately available for sale, unlike those stored in cold wallets. Second, large exchange balances often precede coordinated selling events. Third, exchange inflows frequently correlate with increased volatility as whales execute substantial trades. Market analysts monitor these movements closely because they often signal impending price shifts. Understanding On-Chain Indicators On-chain analysis examines blockchain data to understand investor behavior and market dynamics. Unlike technical analysis, which focuses primarily on price charts, on-chain analysis considers transaction volumes, wallet movements, exchange flows, and network activity. These metrics provide insights into market sentiment that price charts alone cannot reveal. The current Bitcoin price analysis utilizes several key on-chain metrics: Exchange Net Flow: Measures the difference between cryptocurrency entering and leaving exchanges Whale Transaction Count: Tracks large transactions (typically over $100,000) Realized Profit/Loss: Calculates profit-taking behavior among investors MVRV Ratio: Compares market value to realized value to identify over/undervaluation Current data shows elevated exchange inflows coinciding with Bitcoin’s approach to the $94,000 resistance level. This pattern historically precedes price corrections when combined with other bearish signals. The concentration of selling pressure at specific price levels creates resistance zones that require substantial buying volume to overcome. Historical Context of Bitcoin Resistance Levels Bitcoin’s current price action mirrors historical patterns observed during previous market cycles. Resistance levels around psychologically significant price points often require multiple attempts to breach successfully. The $94,000 level represents more than just a round number—it aligns with Fibonacci extension levels from previous market movements and represents a key psychological barrier for traders. Previous Bitcoin cycles demonstrate similar resistance battles. During the 2021 bull run, Bitcoin struggled for weeks to break through the $60,000 resistance before eventually surging to all-time highs. The current market structure shows parallels to that period, though with different fundamental drivers. Institutional adoption has increased substantially since 2021, potentially altering traditional market dynamics. Recent Bitcoin Resistance and Support Levels Price Level Significance Date Tested Outcome $94,000 Current Resistance Present Testing $92,000 Lower Resistance Boundary Present Holding $85,000 Major Support Previous Month Held Strongly $78,000 Secondary Support Two Months Ago Tested Once The $85,000 support level represents a critical floor for Bitcoin’s current price structure. This level previously acted as resistance during Bitcoin’s initial ascent and transformed into support after being decisively breached. Technical analysts consider such role reversals significant because they demonstrate changing market psychology. A retest of this support would provide valuable information about market strength and potential buying interest at lower price levels. Liquidation Dynamics in Derivatives Markets Bitcoin’s potential movement toward $85,000 carries substantial implications for derivatives markets. Current data from derivatives platforms shows significant liquidity clustering around both the $94,000 and $85,000 price levels. These liquidity concentrations represent potential liquidation events that could amplify price movements in either direction. A failure to close above $94,000 could trigger cascading long liquidations as leveraged positions become unprofitable. Conversely, a drop to $85,000 would likely liquidate over-leveraged short positions if the support holds. This dynamic creates a feedback loop where liquidations beget further price movement, which triggers additional liquidations. Risk management becomes crucial during such volatile periods. Market Structure and Institutional Influence The current cryptocurrency market structure differs substantially from previous cycles due to increased institutional participation. Traditional financial institutions, hedge funds, and publicly traded companies now hold significant Bitcoin positions. Their trading behavior often differs from retail investors, potentially altering traditional market patterns. Institutional investors typically employ more sophisticated risk management strategies and longer time horizons. Despite institutional involvement, Bitcoin remains susceptible to psychological price levels and technical patterns. The $94,000 resistance demonstrates this continued relevance of traditional market analysis. However, institutional flows may provide unexpected support during corrections, potentially cushioning downward movements that would have been more severe in previous market environments. Several factors contribute to the current market uncertainty: Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rate policies and inflation concerns Regulatory Developments: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations globally Technological Advancements: Bitcoin network upgrades and Layer 2 solutions Market Sentiment: Shifting investor psychology and risk appetite These interconnected factors create a complex market environment where multiple variables influence price simultaneously. Successful Bitcoin price analysis must consider this multidimensional context rather than focusing solely on technical patterns or on-chain metrics. Conclusion Bitcoin stands at a critical technical juncture with the $94,000 resistance level determining its near-term trajectory. This Bitcoin price analysis reveals conflicting signals between technical indicators favoring buyers and on-chain data suggesting whale selling pressure. The potential retest of $85,000 support represents a significant market event that would test investor conviction and market structure resilience. Market participants should monitor exchange flows, liquidation levels, and macroeconomic developments closely during this volatile period. Regardless of short-term price movements, Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition remains intact, though traders must navigate current volatility with appropriate risk management strategies. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin failing to secure $94,000 mean for investors? Failure to close above $94,000 suggests continued selling pressure at higher price levels. This could indicate that Bitcoin needs more time to consolidate before attempting another breakout or that a correction toward lower support levels is imminent. Q2: Why is $85,000 considered important support for Bitcoin? The $85,000 level previously acted as resistance during Bitcoin’s ascent and transformed into support after being breached. This role reversal makes it psychologically and technically significant, with substantial buying interest likely concentrated around this price point. Q3: How do whale movements affect Bitcoin’s price? Whale transactions involving large Bitcoin amounts can significantly impact market liquidity and price discovery. When whales move cryptocurrency to exchanges, it often signals potential selling, while withdrawals typically indicate long-term holding intentions. Q4: What is the difference between technical and on-chain analysis? Technical analysis focuses on price charts, patterns, and indicators, while on-chain analysis examines blockchain data including transaction volumes, wallet movements, and network activity. Both approaches provide valuable but different market insights. Q5: How might institutional investors respond to a Bitcoin price correction? Institutional responses vary but often include dollar-cost averaging during dips, hedging through derivatives, or rebalancing portfolio allocations. Some institutions view corrections as buying opportunities, while others may reduce exposure depending on their investment mandates.

Japan set the tone for the pause. The Nikkei slipped in early trade and helped drag the MSCI Asia Pacific Index lower after four straight days of gains, while the yen stayed steady against the dollar. Tension between Asia’s two biggest economies gave investors an extra reason to take some risk off. China imposed new controls on exports to Japan with potential military uses, and the Ministry of Commerce said all dual-use items were banned from being exported to Japan for military use effective immediately, with the export control list spanning more than 800 items. In crypto, the price action stayed contained even as the macro headlines kept coming.

Brent and WTI extended losses after President Donald Trump said Venezuela would turn over as many as 50M barrels of crude to the US, adding another twist to supply expectations. Wall Street had delivered the handoff overnight. US stocks ended higher on Monday, with financials lifting the Dow to a record close and energy shares jumping after the US military strike that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, as investors bet the move could open access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. FTSE Hits New High As Tech And AI Themes Stay Strong The broader risk bid has also travelled into Europe. London’s FTSE 100 climbed to a record this week, helped by energy and defence stocks as markets digested the Venezuela shock. Tech remained the market’s favourite story, especially after CES updates kept the AI trade in motion. Nvidia said the upbeat revenue outlook it delivered in October has only grown more bullish, and it reiterated its view tied to roughly $500B of data center chip revenue by the end of 2026. The next catalyst sits on the calendar. Investors are lining up for US business activity updates and Friday’s jobs report, since a softer run of data has kept rate cut expectations alive and helped markets keep their footing.

The broader pattern still resembles a descending wedge, with higher lows forming above the December bottom near $80,500. However, upside momentum has cooled. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview RSI has rolled over toward the 50 zone, signaling consolidation rather than trend acceleration. Candlesticks have also shifted, with smaller bodies and upper wicks replacing the strong bullish closes seen earlier this month, highlighting hesitation near resistance. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Key Levels That Could Decide the Next Move Technically, Bitcoin is at a crossroads. A confirmed break and close above $94,500 would invalidate the triple-top risk and open a path toward $97,300, followed by $100,700, where long-term structure converges. Failure to reclaim that zone keeps downside risks alive toward $90,900, with stronger demand expected near $87,000–$88,000. From a trading perspective, patience remains the edge. Breakout traders will want confirmation above $95,000, while dip buyers may look for stability above $90,000 with defined risk. As volatility compresses and technical structure tightens, Bitcoin appears to be coiling, not breaking, keeping the longer-term bullish narrative intact as the next catalyst approaches. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category.

This move, originating from a substantial $15 million withdrawal from the Aave lending protocol, highlights a calculated shift in asset allocation within the rapidly evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. The transaction provides a clear window into the sophisticated treasury management strategies now employed by major financial entities operating in the digital asset space. Analyzing the World Liberty Financial WBTC to ETH Transaction Blockchain analytics provider Onchainlens first reported the activity. According to their data, an address associated with World Liberty Financial initiated a withdrawal of 162.69 WBTC from Aave. Subsequently, the entity swapped 13.56 WBTC, valued at roughly $1.25 million, for Ethereum. This represents a deliberate reallocation of a portion of its crypto holdings. Importantly, the transaction was executed on-chain, providing full transparency and verifiable proof of the asset movement. Such visibility is a hallmark of DeFi activity, contrasting with the opaque nature of traditional finance. This action is not merely a simple trade. It reflects a deeper, strategic decision-making process. Portfolio rebalancing is a core tenet of professional asset management. Institutions periodically adjust their holdings to maintain target allocations, manage risk exposure, and capitalize on perceived market opportunities. The conversion from a Bitcoin-pegged asset to Ethereum suggests a nuanced view on the relative value or utility prospects of the two leading cryptocurrency networks. The Broader Context of Institutional DeFi Activity The transaction occurs against a backdrop of increasing institutional engagement with decentralized protocols. Aave, as a leading liquidity market protocol, has become a cornerstone for institutional DeFi strategies. Entities use it not only for borrowing and lending but also as a secure, non-custodial vault for holding assets while earning yield. The initial $15 million WBTC withdrawal from Aave itself is a noteworthy event, potentially signaling a change in yield-seeking strategy or a need for liquid assets for other purposes. To understand the scale, consider the typical behavior of large holders, often called “whales.” Their movements can influence market sentiment and liquidity. The table below contrasts common motivations for such swaps: Potential Motivation Description Yield Optimization Moving assets to protocols or chains offering higher returns on Ethereum-based assets. Strategic Reallocation Adjusting portfolio weight based on long-term thesis for Ethereum’s ecosystem growth versus Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Operational Needs Acquiring ETH to pay for transaction fees (gas) on the Ethereum network for future deployments or interactions. Risk Management Diversifying away from a single asset exposure (Bitcoin-correlated) into the broader application ecosystem of Ethereum. Furthermore, the choice between holding native Bitcoin and WBTC is itself strategic. WBTC brings Bitcoin’s value onto the Ethereum blockchain, enabling its use across countless DeFi applications. This interoperability is a key driver for institutional adoption. Expert Perspective on Treasury Management Trends Financial analysts observing crypto treasury trends note that such moves are becoming more methodical. “We are past the phase of indiscriminate accumulation,” notes a report from a digital asset research firm. “Sophisticated entities like World Liberty Financial are now actively managing their crypto treasuries with the same rigor applied to traditional portfolios. Asset swaps for rebalancing, preparing for network-specific investments, or hedging are standard operating procedure.” The timing of such a swap can also be informative. While the report does not speculate on short-term market calls, the action demonstrates proactive management. It shows a willingness to transact based on an internal strategy rather than passive holding. This activity contributes to the maturation and liquidity of the underlying markets, as large, deliberate trades provide price discovery and depth. Implications for the DeFi and Broader Crypto Ecosystem The implications of this transaction extend beyond a single entity’s balance sheet. First, it reinforces the legitimacy of DeFi protocols like Aave as infrastructure capable of handling significant institutional capital flows. Second, it underscores the growing importance of cross-chain and cross-asset strategies. The seamless conversion from a Bitcoin-representative asset to Ethereum exemplifies the composability that defines DeFi. Key impacts include: Validation of DeFi Infrastructure: Large-scale withdrawals and swaps test network capacity and protocol security, ultimately strengthening the ecosystem. Liquidity Signal: Moving $1.3 million between major assets affects pool depths on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), influencing slippage models and liquidity provider returns. Sentiment Indicator: While not a direct market signal, institutional rebalancing towards Ethereum can be interpreted by the market as a vote of confidence in its utility and future roadmap, including its transition to proof-of-stake and scaling solutions. This activity also highlights the critical role of blockchain analytics firms like Onchainlens. Their reporting transforms raw, anonymous blockchain data into actionable intelligence, providing the market with transparency. This transparency, in turn, builds trust—a essential component for further institutional adoption. Conclusion The $1.3 million WBTC to ETH conversion by World Liberty Financial is a microcosm of a larger trend: the professionalization of cryptocurrency asset management. This is not speculative trading but a calculated portfolio rebalance executed within the transparent framework of decentralized finance. The move from a Bitcoin-pegged asset to Ethereum reflects strategic considerations around ecosystem utility, yield opportunities, and long-term portfolio composition. As institutions continue to engage with protocols like Aave and manage on-chain treasuries, such transparent, strategic transactions will become increasingly commonplace, further cementing the integration of traditional finance and decentralized technology. FAQs Q1: What is WBTC and why would an institution use it? WBTC, or Wrapped Bitcoin, is a tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Institutions use it to bring Bitcoin’s value into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem to earn yield, use as collateral, or trade for other assets without leaving the blockchain. Q2: Why use Aave for holding such large amounts of WBTC? Aave is a leading, audited, and secure DeFi lending protocol. By depositing WBTC into Aave, institutions can earn interest (yield) on their otherwise idle assets while maintaining custody, a key non-custodial advantage over traditional finance. Q3: Does swapping WBTC for ETH mean the institution is bearish on Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Portfolio rebalancing is a normal practice. They may believe Ethereum’s growth prospects are currently more favorable, need ETH for operational purposes (like paying gas fees), or simply be adjusting to a pre-defined asset allocation target. It reflects a tactical adjustment, not always a long-term bearish view. Q4: How can we be sure this address belongs to World Liberty Financial? Blockchain analytics firms use sophisticated methods including pattern analysis, known interaction with labeled addresses (like exchange deposits/withdrawals), and sometimes public statements or disclosures to attribute large wallets to specific entities. While not 100% infallible, firms like Onchainlens have established credibility in accurate attribution. Q5: What does this mean for the average cryptocurrency investor? For average investors, it demonstrates the growing sophistication of the market. It highlights the importance of understanding DeFi tools for asset management and serves as a case study in strategic thinking. However, it should not be taken as direct investment advice, as institutional strategies are based on specific risk profiles and goals that differ from those of individual retail investors.

Hughes noted that the XRP/BTC trading pair is approaching the monthly Ichimoku Cloud, a resistance level it has not surpassed since 2018. A confirmed move above this level may indicate the start of a sustained period in which XRP outperforms Bitcoin. Currently, XRP trades against BTC at 0.00002501, positioning it just below the Ichimoku Cloud. This cloud has acted as a strong barrier for nearly eight years, repeatedly limiting upward momentum. According to Hughes, breaking above this structure would be a decisive long-term signal, potentially ending XRP’s extended period of underperformance relative to BTC. Something incredibly bullish is developing on the $XRP / $BTC chart that has not happened in a very long time. Its about to break above the monthly Ichimoku cloud for the first time since 2018 which means $XRP is about to massively outperform $BTC pic.twitter.com/rArWcauvjM — The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) January 5, 2026 Historical Significance of the Ichimoku Cloud The Ichimoku Cloud has historically served as a reliable indicator of XRP’s relative strength. Between 2015 and early 2017, XRP traded below the cloud, displaying little directional momentum against BTC. That changed in early 2017, when XRP broke decisively above the cloud, initiating a significant rally. The pair surged from approximately 0.00002 BTC to a peak near 0.00023 BTC by January 2018, a period during which XRP outperformed Bitcoin significantly. Following the 2018 peak, the trend reversed. XRP/BTC fell back into the cloud and eventually dropped below it, signaling a long-term shift in momentum. From 2018 through 2020, XRP underperformed Bitcoin consistently, moving from above 0.0002 BTC to as low as 0.0000065 BTC. Attempts to recover during this period were repeatedly rejected by resistance levels within the cloud, reinforcing Bitcoin’s dominance. Between 2021 and 2023, XRP/BTC remained largely sideways beneath the cloud. Even amid the 2021 bull market, XRP failed to reclaim this resistance, reflecting persistent pressure from regulatory uncertainty and the ongoing SEC lawsuit. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Setup and Potential Breakout The latter half of 2024 brought some improvement. After a prolonged downturn from August 2023 to June 2024, XRP began forming higher lows, and the Ichimoku Cloud started to flatten. The price began to press against the cloud instead of retreating, suggesting diminishing downward momentum. Although bearish conditions in Q4 2025 temporarily halted XRP’s advance, the altcoin has posted a 27% gain in 2026, outperforming the broader market. The XRP/BTC pair now trades at the lower edge of the monthly Ichimoku Cloud near 0.000025 BTC. Hughes emphasized that the current cloud structure appears weaker than in previous years, resembling conditions before the 2017 breakout. A monthly close above the Ichimoku Cloud would indicate a meaningful trend reversal, ending seven years of underperformance against Bitcoin. Such a development would not require Bitcoin to decline but would suggest that XRP could begin appreciating at a faster rate than BTC. If XRP were to reach the 2018 peak of 0.00023 BTC while Bitcoin trades around $93,000, the implied XRP price could approach $21. Hughes notes that while momentum is building, other indicators, such as Bollinger Bands, suggest XRP’s trend is still somewhat weaker than Bitcoin’s. Overall, analysts highlight this as a key technical juncture for altcoin, with a breakout above the Ichimoku Cloud representing a potential shift in its long-term trajectory versus Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Rose Over 41% The Last Time Institutions Turned Into Net Buyers As pointed out by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards in an X post, institutions have once again turned into net buyers of Bitcoin. Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the trend in institutional behavior over the last few years. From the graph, it’s visible that institutional investors switched their behavior to selling back in October as Bitcoin observed a bearish shift following its price top above $126,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Ends: Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal The distribution calmed down as the cryptocurrency stabilized into a phase of consolidation in December, with a turn to positive levels starting to appear. The metric has now grown further in the new year, a potential sign that institutional behavior may really be changing to one of net accumulation. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the price moves that followed shifts to net buying from these humongous traders in the past. It would appear that, on average, Bitcoin rose 109% after this signal appeared. Though the individual outcomes have seen high variance, ranging from a rally of 390% after the 2020 signal to a drop of 13% in 2024. The last time that the signal appeared was in the first half of 2025 and what followed was a price surge of 41%. It now remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency’s price will be affected this time around. A notable pillar of institutional buying in the sector today is represented by the treasury companies. Like the wider institutional behavior, these entities were also net sellers of Bitcoin late last year, as Edwards has highlighted in another X post. The above chart shows the trend in the 30-day rate of change in the Buy-Sell Ratio associated with BTC treasuries, a metric that compares their cumulative USD buying against selling. It would appear that the indicator has just flipped positive in 2026. “Bitcoin treasury companies just flipped to net buying again,” noted the analyst.

This substantial liquidation event highlights the ongoing volatility in digital asset markets and underscores the risks associated with leveraged trading positions across major exchanges. Market analysts immediately began examining the cascading effects across Ethereum and Solana derivatives markets, revealing distinct patterns in trader positioning and risk management strategies. BTC Liquidations Reveal Market Stress Points The $144 million Bitcoin liquidation figure represents one of the most significant forced position closures in recent months. Consequently, market participants faced substantial losses as leveraged long positions became unsustainable during the price decline. Typically, such liquidations occur when traders’ margin requirements fail during rapid price movements. Furthermore, exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent systemic risk. The dominance of long position liquidations at 77.65% clearly indicates that most traders anticipated upward price movement. However, market conditions instead moved against their expectations, triggering a cascade of automated sell orders. Historical data from previous liquidation events shows similar patterns during market corrections. For instance, the May 2021 market downturn saw $8.6 billion in liquidations over three days. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse triggered $3.5 billion in liquidations. Comparatively, the current event appears more contained but still significant for short-term market structure. Market analysts monitor these events closely because they often precede periods of reduced volatility as overleveraged positions clear from the system. Understanding Forced Liquidation Mechanics Cryptocurrency perpetual futures contracts allow traders to use leverage, amplifying both potential gains and losses. When positions move against traders, exchanges issue margin calls requiring additional collateral. If traders fail to meet these requirements, exchanges automatically liquidate positions. This process creates selling pressure that can accelerate price declines. Major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX typically handle the majority of these liquidations. Their risk management systems automatically trigger these events to protect overall market stability. Comparative Analysis Across Major Cryptocurrencies The liquidation data reveals divergent patterns across different digital assets. While Bitcoin experienced predominantly long position liquidations, Ethereum and Solana presented more mixed scenarios. This divergence suggests varying trader sentiment and positioning strategies across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Cryptocurrency Total Liquidations Long Position % Short Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $144 million 77.65% 22.35% Ethereum (ETH) $97.03 million 51.55% 48.45% Solana (SOL) $35.85 million 39.26% 60.74% Ethereum’s nearly balanced liquidation ratio at 51.55% long versus 48.45% short indicates relatively neutral market positioning. This balance suggests Ethereum traders maintained more diversified exposure. Conversely, Solana’s 60.74% short position liquidations reveal that many traders bet against SOL’s price appreciation. These traders faced losses when Solana’s price moved contrary to their expectations. Such divergent patterns across assets demonstrate the complexity of cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Market Context and Contributing Factors Several macroeconomic and cryptocurrency-specific factors contributed to the liquidation event. First, traditional financial markets showed weakness, with major indices declining. Second, regulatory developments created uncertainty about digital asset classification. Third, exchange reserves data indicated some institutional outflow from cryptocurrency products. Additionally, technical analysis showed Bitcoin approaching key support levels that often trigger automated trading responses. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions influenced broader market sentiment. Rising interest rates typically reduce risk appetite across all speculative assets. Cryptocurrency markets often amplify these effects due to their 24/7 trading nature and global participation. Geopolitical tensions also contributed to risk-off sentiment among institutional investors. These investors frequently reduce exposure to volatile assets during uncertain periods. Expert Analysis of Market Implications Seasoned market analysts emphasize that liquidation events serve important market functions. They remove excessive leverage from the system, potentially creating healthier foundations for future price movements. However, large-scale liquidations can also create temporary market dislocations. These dislocations sometimes present buying opportunities for patient investors. Historical patterns suggest markets often stabilize after major liquidation events as weak hands exit positions. Derivatives data provides crucial insights into market sentiment extremes. When long positions dominate liquidations, it often signals excessive bullishness preceding the event. Conversely, short-dominated liquidations suggest pervasive bearish sentiment. Monitoring these metrics helps traders identify potential turning points. The current data suggests Bitcoin traders were overly optimistic while Solana traders were excessively pessimistic before the price movements. Risk Management Lessons for Traders The liquidation event underscores several important risk management principles for cryptocurrency traders: Position sizing : Using appropriate position sizes relative to account balance Leverage moderation : Avoiding excessive leverage that increases liquidation risk Stop-loss orders : Implementing stop-losses to manage downside risk Portfolio diversification : Spreading exposure across different assets and strategies Market monitoring : Watching funding rates and open interest for warning signs Experienced traders often reduce leverage during periods of expected volatility. They also monitor exchange metrics like estimated liquidation prices. These prices indicate where forced selling might occur. Advanced traders sometimes use these levels to plan entry and exit strategies. The current event demonstrates how quickly conditions can change in cryptocurrency markets. Historical Perspective on Liquidation Events Cryptocurrency markets have experienced numerous liquidation events throughout their development. Each event provides valuable data about market structure and participant behavior. The 2018 bear market featured extended periods of liquidations as prices declined steadily. The 2020 COVID crash triggered massive liquidations across all risk assets. More recently, the 2022 bear market saw repeated liquidation waves as leverage unwound throughout the year. Comparing current events to historical precedents helps contextualize their significance. The $144 million Bitcoin liquidation represents a substantial single-day event but remains below extreme historical levels. This suggests markets have matured with better risk management practices. However, the concentration in long positions indicates specific sentiment extremes that warrant attention. Market participants should study these patterns to improve future decision-making. Conclusion The $144 million BTC liquidation event highlights ongoing volatility in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Long positions dominated these forced closures at 77.65%, revealing previously excessive bullish sentiment. Comparative analysis shows divergent patterns across Ethereum and Solana markets. These events serve important market functions by removing excessive leverage and resetting sentiment extremes. Traders should incorporate risk management lessons from such events into their strategies. Monitoring liquidation data provides valuable insights into market positioning and potential turning points. As cryptocurrency markets continue maturing, understanding these dynamics becomes increasingly important for all participants. FAQs Q1: What causes cryptocurrency futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when traders’ positions lose enough value that their remaining collateral cannot cover potential losses. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent negative balances that could affect other users. Q2: Why did long positions dominate Bitcoin liquidations? Most Bitcoin traders used leverage to bet on price increases. When prices declined instead, their positions became underwater, triggering margin calls and subsequent liquidations from exchanges. Q3: How do liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Forced liquidations create additional selling pressure as exchanges automatically close positions. This can accelerate price declines during downturns or amplify rallies during short squeezes. Q4: What’s the difference between long and short position liquidations? Long position liquidations occur when traders betting on price increases get forced out. Short position liquidations happen when traders betting on price decreases face the same forced exits. Q5: How can traders avoid liquidation? Traders can use proper position sizing, moderate leverage, stop-loss orders, and maintain adequate collateral buffers. Monitoring market conditions and reducing exposure during high volatility also helps.

ETH is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $3,300. Ethereum started a fresh increase above $3,150 and $3,200. The price is trading above $3,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $3,265 zone. Ethereum Price Holds Gains Ethereum price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $3,120 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $3,200 and $3,220 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price toward $3,300. A high was formed at $3,299, and the price is now consolidating gains. It declined a few points to test the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $3,181 swing low to the $3,299 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If the bulls are able to protect more losses below $3,200, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $3,265 level. The first key resistance is near the $3,280 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,300 level. A clear move above the $3,300 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,265 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,220 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $3,181 swing low to the $3,299 high. The first major support sits near the $3,200 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,200 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support.

Bitcoin is often characterized by its high degree of security, mainly due to its underlying blockchain technology. However, experts caution that a new threat powered by quantum computing could pose significant risks to cryptography through cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs). Quantum computing threatens Bitcoin’s cryptographic security David Duong, the head of global investment research at Coinbase, cautioned that advances in quantum computing are raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin. The Coinbase executive cited a previous concern highlighted by BlackRock in its amended prospectus for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), filed with the SEC on May 9, 2025. BlackRock highlighted in the filings that the cryptographic infrastructure supporting Bitcoin could become “flawed or ineffective” due to the development of quantum computing technology. The investment fund explained that quantum computing is still in its early stages of development and, therefore, difficult to project its ultimate impact on the broader blockchain infrastructure. The report also noted that quantum computing applications could advance to the point where they possess the ability to compromise Bitcoin’s security by allowing malicious attackers to infiltrate its security and compromise wallets with Bitcoin holdings. According to Duong, quantum computing will necessitate upgrades to many of the cryptographic systems currently in use. He also explained that traditional finance may be among the most affected sectors due to its overreliance on closed systems. Duong said open protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum are also preparing for the effect of quantum computing. Duong said that cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) could gain the capability to run Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms, which may destabilize Bitcoin’s cryptographic infrastructure. He emphasized that the new technology brings two types of risks into scope, which are likely to compromise Bitcoin’s SHA-256 for the proof-of-work mining processes and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) that powers transaction signatures. The Coinbase researcher stated that cryptographically relevant quantum computers could potentially break the “cryptographic security of private keys” and allow malicious actors to steal crypto assets from vulnerable addresses. He added that other attacks could infiltrate Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure by mining blocks more efficiently. 32.7% of BTC’s supply is at risk of long-range attacks Duong added that quantum mining is a lower-priority concern for now, but signature migration carries immediate risks. He said that initial threats span “into two dimensions: long-range attacks against outputs whose public keys are already exposed onchain, and short-range attacks that could front-run spends as public keys appear in the mempool.” Source: David Duong , CFA, Coinbase BTC at risk of quantum attacks due to vulnerable addresses According to the researcher, approximately 32.7% of Bitcoin’s supply, or roughly 6.51 million BTC, is vulnerable to long-range attacks due to the reuse of addresses and script types that reveal public keys onchain. He highlighted such scripts, including Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK), bare multisig (P2MS), and Taproot (P2TR). He also mentioned that every output is vulnerable to short-range attacks at the time of spending, which prompts the need to migrate to quantum-resistant signatures, despite the low possibility of an attack. The warning comes as scientists continue to advance the development of quantum computers. Quantum computers utilize quantum mechanics to process data in more advanced ways than traditional computers. Pierre-Luc Dallaire-Demers, a quantum computing scientist at Google, stated in October 2025 that these advanced computers will be able to break Bitcoin’s cryptography in under five years. Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, a recent report from Cryptopolitan noted that Google claimed a breakthrough in AI and quantum computing. The technology conglomerate stated that it had developed a computer algorithm that suggests potential directions for practical applications of quantum computing. According to the report, Google said the algorithm will generate unique data for use with AI.

While price action alone still falls short of confirming a renewed uptrend, on-chain data suggests that underlying market conditions may be stabilizing beneath the surface. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows According to top analyst Axel Adler, the On-Chain Pressure Oscillator is offering an important lens into current market dynamics. The indicator, which aggregates exchange netflows, short-term holder realized profit and loss, and long-term coin spending into a single percentile-based signal, is currently sitting around the 46 level. Historically, this zone has been associated with accumulation phases rather than distribution. What stands out in the current reading is the absence of aggressive sellers. Exchange inflows remain muted, indicating that investors are not rushing to move coins to trading venues. At the same time, older coins are largely dormant, suggesting that long-term holders are not capitulating despite recent volatility. Short-term holders remain under pressure, but their losses appear contained, limiting forced selling. Together, these factors point to a market that is deleveraged and relatively balanced, with sell-side pressure constrained more by a lack of supply than by surging demand. Short-Term Holder Stress Keeps Sell-Side Pressure Contained Adler adds that recent movements in the On-Chain Pressure Oscillator reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is still locked in a consolidation regime. While the daily readings of the oscillator have softened over the past few sessions, the smoothed trend remains broadly stable. Historically, similar configurations have tended to appear during pause phases, when the market digests prior moves before committing to a new direction. Importantly, this stability suggests that sell-side pressure from key cohorts remains muted, even as demand has yet to show a decisive expansion. The main risk to this structure would be a sustained breakdown in the smoothed oscillator below neutral levels. Such a move would indicate a shift away from accumulation toward distribution, signaling that sellers are regaining control. This dynamic is closely linked to Bitcoin’s position relative to the Short-Term Holder (STH) realized price. With BTC trading below the average cost basis of holders who entered within the last five months, most short-term participants are currently underwater. This limits their ability to take profits and reduces immediate selling incentives. As a result, sell pressure remains constrained despite recent price weakness. However, this balance may change if Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 area. A return to breakeven for short-term holders could unlock supply and create resistance. A healthier signal would be price reclaiming the STH realized level while the oscillator strengthens, confirming renewed demand rather than mere absence of selling.

Bitcoin Rebounds From December Lows but Faces Heavy Overhead Resistance Bitcoin is trading near the $94,000 area after rebounding sharply from the December lows around $82,000–$84,000. The chart shows a clear recovery leg following a steep corrective phase that unfolded after the October peak near $125,000. While the bounce has restored short-term momentum, the broader structure remains technically constrained. Price is currently reclaiming the short-term moving average, which has started to curl upward and act as dynamic support. This is a constructive development, suggesting that downside momentum has eased and buyers are regaining some control. However, Bitcoin remains below the mid- and long-term moving averages, which are still sloping downward. These levels, clustered between roughly $100,000 and $105,000, represent a significant overhead resistance zone that bulls must clear to reestablish a bullish trend. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Setup Advances: CEX Volume Hits Cycle Highs Despite Price Weakness Selling pressure peaked during the November–December breakdown, while the current rebound has occurred on more moderate volume, indicating stabilization rather than aggressive accumulation. Structurally, the market appears to be transitioning from a sharp sell-off into a consolidation and recovery phase. Holding above the $90,000–$92,000 region is critical to maintain this constructive setup. A failure to defend this zone would expose Bitcoin to renewed downside risk, while a sustained move above the declining moving averages would signal a more durable shift in market direction.

56918933,654347,1767758444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56918933.jpeg,"3,200 Bitcoin In Motion: Galaxy Digital Activity Adds Sell-Side Pressure Risk",https://bitcoinist.com/3200-bitcoin-galaxy-digital-activity-adds-sell-side/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin opened the year trading above the $93,000 level, offering bulls a brief sense of relief after weeks of heavy consolidation and persistent selling pressure. The move higher suggests that buyers are still active at key demand zones and willing to defend prices above the psychological $90,000 mark. Short-term momentum has improved, and price action is stabilizing after the sharp drawdown seen late last year. However, despite this early show of strength, the broader market structure remains fragile. Many analysts continue to warn that the dominant trend is still tilted to the downside. Bitcoin remains below several critical structural levels, and upside attempts have yet to invalidate the broader corrective phase. In this context, renewed volatility should not be ruled out, especially as liquidity conditions and on-chain behavior remain mixed. Adding to this cautious outlook, top analyst Darkfost highlights a notable on-chain development: Galaxy Digital has moved more than 3,200 BTC in recent transactions. Large transfers from institutional entities often attract close scrutiny, as they can signal portfolio rebalancing, liquidity management, or preparation for market activity. While such movements do not automatically imply imminent selling, they tend to increase short-term uncertainty when the market is already sensitive. Institutional Exchange Inflows Raise Short-Term Supply Risk According to Darkfost’s analysis , a portion of the Bitcoin recently moved by Galaxy Digital has already reached major centralized exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase. Notably, roughly 560 BTC—worth close to $50 million—were transferred to exchanges in a single day. In on-chain terms, this type of movement is significant because transfers to exchanges typically increase the probability that coins are being prepared for sale, hedging, or liquidity provision. In the current market context, these flows carry added weight. Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize above key psychological levels, but overall sentiment remains cautious, and liquidity conditions are still tight. When large holders send coins to exchanges during such phases, it often introduces short-term supply risk, as even partial selling can weigh on price if spot demand is not strong enough to absorb it. However, it is important to avoid overinterpreting a single data point. Institutional entities like Galaxy Digital manage large, diversified strategies that can include OTC sales, derivatives hedging, or internal reallocations. Not all exchange inflows result in immediate spot selling. That said, the timing is notable: these transfers are occurring while Bitcoin is still struggling to reclaim major resistance levels. From a market perspective, this behavior reinforces a cautious stance. It suggests that some large players may be taking advantage of the recent rebound to reduce exposure or manage risk, rather than aggressively accumulating. As a result, continued monitoring of exchange inflows and follow-through selling pressure will be critical in assessing whether this rebound can sustain or faces renewed downside pressure. Bitcoin Consolidates As Bulls Test Structural Resistance Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after a sharp corrective phase, with price now consolidating around the $93,000–$94,000 zone. The recent rebound has allowed BTC to reclaim territory above the weekly 50-period moving average, which currently acts as short-term dynamic support. This recovery signals that buyers are still active, particularly after the late-2025 sell-off pushed price toward the $85,000–$88,000 region. However, the structure remains mixed. Bitcoin is still trading below the declining weekly 100-period moving average, a level that has historically acted as a trend-defining resistance during transitional phases. The failure to reclaim this moving average on a weekly close suggests that bullish momentum, while improving, is not yet strong enough to confirm a full trend continuation. The 200-period moving average remains far below the current price, reinforcing that the broader macro uptrend is intact, but near-term conditions remain fragile. Volume has increased modestly during the rebound, indicating participation, though not at levels typically associated with strong breakout phases. This supports the view that the move higher may still be corrective rather than impulsive. Bitcoin appears to be in a consolidation-to-recovery phase. Sustained acceptance above the $95,000–$100,000 zone would be required to shift the structure decisively bullish. Until then, price action suggests cautious optimism rather than confirmation of a renewed uptrend.

This notable withdrawal of capital marks a reversal following two consecutive days of net inflows, presenting a critical data point for investors monitoring the maturation and volatility of these groundbreaking financial products. The movement underscores the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of capital allocation within digital asset vehicles. Bitcoin ETF Outflow Analysis: A Detailed Breakdown The January 6th data reveals a stark divergence in investor sentiment across different fund providers. While the aggregate flow turned negative, the distribution was far from uniform. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerged as the sole exception to the trend, successfully attracting a substantial inflow of $231.89 million. This singular positive flow highlights a potential flight to perceived quality and stability during periods of market uncertainty. Conversely, other major funds witnessed capital departures. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the outflows with a significant $312.24 million withdrawal. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the converted fund with a historically higher fee structure, saw outflows of $83.07 million. Furthermore, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust and funds from Ark Invest (ARKB) and VanEck (HODL) recorded smaller outflows of $32.73 million, $29.47 million, and $14.38 million, respectively. Contextualizing the Capital Movement To fully understand this event, one must consider the broader timeline. Spot Bitcoin ETFs only began trading in the United States in January 2024, following a landmark regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Their first year of operation was characterized by immense volatility, record-breaking inflows, and intense competition on fee structures. The January 2025 outflow occurs within this context of a still-stabilizing market. Analysts often scrutinize such flows for signals about institutional sentiment, Bitcoin’s price correlation, and the competitive landscape among asset managers. This single day’s data, while significant, represents a snapshot within a longer-term narrative of adoption and price discovery. Potential Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency ETF Shift Several interrelated factors could contribute to a day of net outflows. First, macroeconomic conditions heavily influence all risk assets, including Bitcoin. Shifts in interest rate expectations, inflation data, or geopolitical tensions can prompt investors to rebalance portfolios away from perceived higher-risk holdings. Second, profit-taking is a common phenomenon following periods of positive price performance. If Bitcoin’s price appreciated significantly in the preceding days, some investors may have chosen to realize gains through ETF redemptions. Third, internal competition between the ETFs themselves plays a role. Investors may rotate capital from funds with higher expense ratios to those with lower fees, or from newer entrants to more established players with deeper liquidity, as the IBIT inflow might suggest. Key factors influencing ETF flows include: Macroeconomic Indicators: U.S. Treasury yields, dollar strength, and equity market performance. Bitcoin Price Action: Sharp rallies or corrections directly impact ETF demand. Fee Competition: Ongoing pressure on management expense ratios (MERs). Liquidity and Volume: Traders prefer funds with tight bid-ask spreads. Regulatory News: Statements from the SEC or other agencies can affect sentiment. Expert Perspective on Market Mechanics Market structure experts emphasize that daily flows for any ETF, particularly one tracking a volatile asset like Bitcoin, should be interpreted as part of a trend, not in isolation. A single day of outflows does not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish turn. Instead, it reflects the natural ebb and flow of capital as investors react to new information and adjust risk exposures. The critical insight from January 6th may be the demonstrated resilience of BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted capital even as others bled. This could signal a consolidating market where a handful of large, low-cost, highly liquid funds begin to dominate the landscape, mirroring trends in traditional equity ETFs. Comparative Performance and Historical Data Placing the $240 million net outflow in historical context is essential. During their initial launch phase in early 2024, these ETFs saw inflows measured in the billions of dollars over single weeks. Therefore, a $240 million daily outflow, while notable, is not unprecedented in scale. The following table contrasts the flow data from January 6th with a simplified view of the competitive landscape based on key attributes. ETF Ticker Provider Jan 6 Flow Key Attribute IBIT BlackRock +$231.89M Low fee, high liquidity FBTC Fidelity -$312.24M Low fee, direct custody GBTC Grayscale -$83.07M Higher fee, large AUM base ARKB Ark Invest -$29.47M Thematic, active strategy This data snapshot reveals the fierce competition among issuers. The outflow from GBTC continues a longer-term trend often attributed to its 1.5% fee, which is higher than many competitors who launched with fees below 0.3%. The substantial outflow from FBTC, despite its low fee, suggests the movement may be driven by broader market factors rather than just fee arbitrage. Impact on Bitcoin Price and Market Sentiment The relationship between ETF flows and Bitcoin’s spot price is complex and bidirectional. Large net inflows typically create buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin, as authorized participants (APs) purchase BTC to create new ETF shares. Conversely, net outflows force APs to sell Bitcoin to fund redemptions, potentially exerting downward price pressure. On January 6th, the net selling pressure from ETFs equated to roughly 5,000 Bitcoin based on the day’s approximate price. However, the global Bitcoin market’s daily trading volume often exceeds $20 billion, meaning ETF flow impact is one of many price drivers. Nevertheless, sustained periods of outflow can influence broader market sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility or reinforcing negative price trends. The Role of Institutional Adoption Despite daily fluctuations, the enduring narrative for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains their role as a gateway for institutional capital. Financial advisors, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries now have a regulated, familiar vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. Daily flow volatility is expected in this early adoption phase. The true measure of success will be the growth in total assets under management (AUM) over quarters and years, not days. The ability of these products to weather periods of outflow without operational issues also demonstrates the robustness of their underlying creation and redemption mechanisms. Conclusion The $240 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 6, 2025, serves as a potent reminder of the market’s evolving and sometimes turbulent nature. While BlackRock’s IBIT demonstrated notable resilience with a major inflow, the broader trend highlighted shifting short-term capital allocations. This Bitcoin ETF activity must be analyzed within the context of macroeconomic forces, competitive fee structures, and the ongoing process of institutional price discovery. For long-term observers, such data points are less about predicting immediate price moves and more about understanding the maturation of Bitcoin as an asset class within the traditional financial system. The journey of these investment products will undoubtedly feature many more days of both significant inflows and outflows as the market seeks equilibrium. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A1: A net outflow occurs when the total value of shares redeemed by investors exceeds the value of new shares purchased on a given day. This requires the ETF issuer to sell some of the underlying Bitcoin holdings to return cash to those redeeming investors. Q2: Why did only BlackRock’s IBIT see an inflow? A2: While specific investor decisions are private, IBIT’s inflow likely reflects its competitive advantages: extremely low fees, massive issuer scale (BlackRock), and high daily trading liquidity, making it a preferred choice for large institutions during uncertain periods. Q3: Do ETF outflows directly cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? A3: They can contribute to downward pressure, but they are not the sole determinant. Outflows force the sale of Bitcoin by the ETF’s authorized participants, adding sell-side volume. However, the global Bitcoin market is vast, and price is influenced by global demand, futures markets, and macroeconomic factors. Q4: Is this the start of a longer trend of Bitcoin ETF outflows? A4: One day of data cannot confirm a trend. ETF flows are inherently volatile. A trend would require consistent net outflows over several weeks or months, often driven by a sustained negative shift in macroeconomic conditions or Bitcoin price momentum. Q5: How does Grayscale’s GBTC outflow compare to its history? A5: GBTC has experienced consistent outflows since its conversion to an ETF in January 2024, primarily due to its higher management fee compared to new competitors. The $83 million outflow on Jan. 6 is relatively modest within that longer-term context, where outflows have sometimes exceeded $500 million daily.

The price is now trading above $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2.210 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.330. XRP Price Corrects Some Gains XRP price started a major upward move above $2.20 and $2.250, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price gained pace for a clear move above the $2.30 resistance. The bulls even pumped the price above the $2.40 zone. A high was formed at $2.416 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below $2.35 and $2.30. However, the bulls were active near $2.20. A low was formed at $2.206, and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $2.416 swing high to the $2.206 low.

During a segment after the bell last night, MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC’s finance and techn correspondent, pointed out that the Ripple-backed token surged more than 20% in one week, overtook BNB, and became the third-largest crypto by market value, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. MacKenzie said XRP’s rally was not sudden, as the asset had outperformed quietly for months. Even on days when the crypto market was crashing, and it really was, she said it held steady. CNBC is bullish on XRP because it is targeting banks and cross-border payments MacKenzie said the main use case for XRP is payments, specifically cross-border settlement because Ripple designed the token to be a bridge asset. MacKenzie said the XRP pitch differs from Bitcoin’s digital gold story and stablecoins tokenized dollars story. MacKenzie said:- “XRP is trying to be the exchange layer that moves value between currencies. So money is moving into XRP for three big reasons. First, the regulatory overhang has finally cleared as Ripple has fully wrapped up its SEC fight as of August 2nd. It’s a less crowded trade than Bitcoin or Ether. And third, the flows have held up even during the Q4 dip. Investors kept adding to XRP-focused funds while Bitcoin ETF flows fell with the price.” Hosts asked how declines in Bitcoin and Ether fit into the trend, pointing to digital asset treasury companies and the risk of forced selling. But MacKenzie said that concern hangs over those assets. She said it makes sense that investors would look for an alternative inside crypto. MacKenzie also brought up an upcoming decision by MSCI, due in nine days, on whether names like Strategy remain in its indexes. She said that decision could lead to more selling tied to index rules. MacKenzie believes that XRP offers more upside partly because it starts from a lower base, linking that to activity seen late last year when spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows in the fourth quarter and accumulation in XRP instantly picked up. CNBC says Solana is also a top performer aside from XRP MacKenzie then said interest has also grown around Solana, placing it alongside XRP as the two most-watched altcoins. She said Solana draws attention through tokenization, including money market funds, not just stablecoins. Earlier before Wall Street opened, Morgan Stanley announced that it filed an S-1 to launch Bitcoin and Solana ETFs. MacKenzie pointed out that the bank was the first to let advisors suggest spot Bitcoin ETFs and is now expanding product offerings. Since Bitcoin’s size limits percentage gains, faster blockchains allow easier handling of tokenized assets. The panel talked about transaction speed and cost as key factors, saying that Ether can offer cheaper transfers in some cases. They also mentioned that some stablecoin transfers on Coinbase’s Base network currently carry no fees. “For now, many of those stablecoins are transaction free. So the speed is that what’s driving a lot of this, this idea that cost and speed is going to be the 3:11 defining factor for how people gravitate towards certain blockchains,” said MacKenzie. Other blockchains like Tron were mentioned by the panelists as fast options with different pricing. MacKenzie explained that:- “But at different costs, though. Different price points. Solana is a lot more cost‑effective than moving money over the Ethereum blockchain at certain times, which is why you’re seeing people diversify away from the big two.” MacKenzie pointed to Vlad Tenev at Robinhood discussing tokenized equities as well as Brian Armstrong of Coinbase and the company’s push beyond exchange trading. “Brian Armstrong is part of why the Coinbase trade is doing so well. Goldman Sachs upgrading it to a buy has to do with the fact that they’re diversifying away from just being a cryptocurrency exchange, and they’re getting into, like, ultimately more than just trading,” said MacKenzie.

The announcement, made via the company’s official X account on January 6, 2025, validates last year’s ambitious $1.1 billion Bitcoin investment strategy. This strategic shift represents one of Europe’s most significant corporate transitions from traditional retail to digital asset management. Vanadi Bitcoin Strategy: From Coffee Beans to Digital Gold Vanadi Coffee’s corporate transformation began in late 2024 with a formal announcement about its Bitcoin-focused future. The company originally operated as a specialty coffee retailer across Spain. However, management decided to reallocate capital toward Bitcoin reserves. This decision followed extensive market analysis and board approval. Consequently, the company initiated a phased divestment from its coffee operations. The transition involved selling physical assets and inventory. Meanwhile, Vanadi began acquiring Bitcoin through regulated exchanges and over-the-counter desks. The company’s treasury now holds precisely 173 BTC, valued at approximately $11.8 million as of January 6, 2025. This represents the initial phase of their $1.1 billion allocation plan. Corporate Bitcoin adoption has accelerated globally since 2020. Major companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block have established substantial reserves. European corporations, however, have been more cautious in their approach. Vanadi’s announcement therefore signals a potential shift in regional corporate strategy. The move aligns with growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Furthermore, it demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Spanish regulatory frameworks have evolved to accommodate such corporate treasury management strategies. The Bank of Spain has issued guidelines for cryptocurrency holdings. Similarly, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) provides oversight for public companies. Financial Implications and Market Context Vanadi’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy involves dollar-cost averaging over several quarters. The company avoids market timing while accumulating during price corrections. This disciplined approach minimizes volatility impact on their balance sheet. Financial analysts note the accounting treatment differs from traditional assets. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require impairment testing for cryptocurrency holdings. However, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) treat Bitcoin as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Vanadi must therefore navigate complex reporting requirements across jurisdictions. Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Holdings Comparison (2025) Company Bitcoin Holdings Approximate Value Country MicroStrategy 226,331 BTC $15.4 billion United States Tesla 10,500 BTC $715 million United States Block 8,027 BTC $547 million United States Vanadi Coffee 173 BTC $11.8 million Spain Strategic Rationale Behind the Bitcoin Pivot Vanadi’s management team cites multiple factors driving their Bitcoin investment strategy. Primarily, they identify Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. The European Central Bank’s monetary policies have concerned many corporate treasurers. Additionally, Bitcoin’s finite supply contrasts with fiat currency systems. The cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature also appeals to companies seeking asset sovereignty. Vanadi specifically mentioned these advantages in their initial 2024 announcement. The company’s transition required shareholder approval through an extraordinary general meeting. Investors supported the strategy with an 82% majority vote. This demonstrates growing acceptance among traditional business stakeholders. The operational shift involves significant corporate restructuring. Vanadi will maintain minimal coffee operations during the transition period. However, the primary business focus now centers on Bitcoin acquisition and management. The company hired cryptocurrency custody specialists and treasury managers. They also established relationships with regulated custody providers. Security protocols include multi-signature wallets and cold storage solutions. Insurance coverage protects against theft and loss. These measures follow industry best practices for institutional Bitcoin management. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s scarcity provides protection against currency devaluation Portfolio Diversification: Non-correlation with traditional assets reduces overall risk Technological Adoption: Positioning for future financial system evolution Shareholder Value: Potential for substantial capital appreciation over time European Corporate Adoption Trends Vanadi’s announcement coincides with increasing European corporate interest in Bitcoin. German companies have led regional adoption with favorable regulatory conditions. The German Banking Act now recognizes cryptocurrency as financial instruments. Similarly, Swiss corporations benefit from progressive cryptocurrency regulations. Spanish companies, however, have been slower to embrace Bitcoin treasury strategies. Vanadi therefore represents a pioneering example within Iberian business circles. Financial analysts predict other Spanish companies may follow this precedent. The tourism and export sectors show particular interest in cryptocurrency solutions. Regulatory Landscape and Compliance Considerations Spanish cryptocurrency regulations have evolved significantly since 2023. The government implemented the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations ahead of schedule. These frameworks provide clarity for corporate cryptocurrency holdings. Companies must register with the Bank of Spain for anti-money laundering purposes. They must also implement know-your-customer procedures for all transactions. Tax treatment requires careful consideration of capital gains and losses. Vanadi works with specialized legal and accounting firms to ensure full compliance. The company files regular reports with Spanish financial authorities. This transparent approach builds trust with regulators and stakeholders. International standards continue developing for corporate cryptocurrency accounting. The International Accounting Standards Board monitors cryptocurrency reporting practices. Potential changes to accounting standards could affect how companies value Bitcoin holdings. Vanadi’s financial team stays informed about these developments. They participate in industry working groups on cryptocurrency accounting. The company also engages with Spanish banking institutions about cryptocurrency services. Several major Spanish banks now offer cryptocurrency custody for corporate clients. This infrastructure development supports broader corporate adoption. Market Reaction and Industry Analysis Financial markets responded positively to Vanadi’s Bitcoin reserve announcement. The company’s valuation increased approximately 15% following the revelation. Bitcoin’s price showed minimal reaction, indicating the purchase occurred over time. Cryptocurrency analysts note the psychological impact exceeds the financial magnitude. A traditional European company embracing Bitcoin signals mainstream acceptance. Industry observers compare Vanadi’s move to early corporate internet adoption. The strategic pivot demonstrates forward-thinking leadership according to market commentators. Competitor analysis reveals varied responses within the coffee industry. Major global coffee chains continue focusing on traditional expansion. However, some specialty coffee companies monitor cryptocurrency payment integration. Starbucks previously experimented with Bitcoin payments through the Bakkt platform. Other food and beverage companies test blockchain supply chain solutions. Vanadi’s complete business model transformation remains unique within the sector. The company essentially becomes a Bitcoin-focused investment vehicle with coffee heritage. Risk Management and Future Projections Vanadi acknowledges Bitcoin’s volatility presents management challenges. The company employs several risk mitigation strategies. These include gradual accumulation rather than lump-sum purchases. The treasury maintains substantial fiat reserves for operational needs. Hedging strategies using options and futures provide additional protection. The board reviews the Bitcoin strategy quarterly with risk assessment updates. External auditors verify holdings and security protocols annually. This comprehensive approach addresses stakeholder concerns about cryptocurrency risks. Future projections involve completing the $1.1 billion Bitcoin acquisition plan. The timeline extends through 2026 with periodic market updates. Vanadi may explore Bitcoin-related business opportunities beyond treasury management. Potential ventures include mining operations or financial services. The company monitors Bitcoin ecosystem developments for strategic partnerships. European cryptocurrency infrastructure improvements could accelerate their plans. Vanadi’s leadership remains committed to their Bitcoin-focused future despite market fluctuations. Conclusion Vanadi Coffee’s confirmation of 173 Bitcoin holdings validates their strategic pivot toward cryptocurrency. The Spanish company’s transformation from coffee retailer to Bitcoin-focused enterprise represents a significant corporate evolution. Their $1.1 billion investment plan demonstrates substantial commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This development reflects broader trends in corporate cryptocurrency adoption, particularly within European markets. Vanadi’s approach combines disciplined accumulation with rigorous risk management and regulatory compliance. The company’s journey offers valuable insights for other businesses considering Bitcoin treasury strategies. As cryptocurrency integration accelerates globally, Vanadi’s Bitcoin reserve announcement positions them at the forefront of financial innovation. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin does Vanadi Coffee currently hold? Vanadi Coffee holds precisely 173 Bitcoin as confirmed in their January 6, 2025 announcement. This represents the initial phase of their $1.1 billion Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Q2: Why is a coffee company investing in Bitcoin? Vanadi is transitioning from coffee retail to become a Bitcoin-focused enterprise. Management views Bitcoin as a superior treasury reserve asset for inflation protection and potential appreciation. Q3: Is Vanadi completely abandoning its coffee business? The company maintains minimal coffee operations during transition but primarily focuses on Bitcoin acquisition and management as their core business strategy. Q4: How does Spanish regulation affect corporate Bitcoin holdings? Spain implements EU MiCA regulations requiring corporate registration with the Bank of Spain and compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures. Q5: What risks does Vanadi face with its Bitcoin strategy? Primary risks include Bitcoin price volatility, regulatory changes, security threats, and accounting complexities, which the company addresses through phased accumulation and comprehensive risk management.

Matthew Sigel, the head of digital asset research at VanEck, suggested that the proceeds from the BTC sales were just enough to kickstart Riot’s 2026-27 AI build-out. A snapshot report shared on social media by Sigel revealed that the company sold 383 BTC in November 2025 for approximately $37 million and 1,818 BTC in December for roughly $161.6 million, an 8% increase MoM. The total BTC sales over the two months amounted to approximately $198.6 million, which Sigel believes can cover the entire capital expenditure (capex) Riot has set aside for the first 112 MW data center build at Corsicana. Riot expects to complete the project in the first quarter of 2027. Sigel makes raising AI capital look easy The VanEck head of digital asset research made raising capital for AI build-out projects sound easy, teasing that just one winter of BTC sales is enough to fund phase 1 of Riot’s data center. Sigel previously stated that there is a connection between AI and Bitcoin, claiming that Bitcoin miners are among the largest sellers of BTC to fund their AI projects. According to Sigel, companies like Riot need to sell even more BTC to fund rising capex when credit conditions tighten. He noted that the BTC-Nasdaq correlation has increased over the past few months. Meanwhile, Riot produced 428 BTC in November 2025, representing an average of 14.3 BTC per day. The mining company also produced 460 BTC in December 2025 at an average of 14.8 BTC per day, which was an 8% increase MoM, and an 11% decrease YoY. The average net price per BTC sold was $96,560 in November and $88,870 in December. Jason Les, Riot’s CEO, said earlier this year that his company has made a strategic decision to sell its monthly BTC production to fund ongoing AI-focused growth and operations. He added that the move helps reduce Riot’s reliance on equity financing, limiting shareholder dilution. Riot expands deployed hashrate by 5% MoM In line with Riot’s strategic BTC production and sale to fund AI build-outs, the miner increased its deployed hashrate by 5% MoM, jumping slightly from 36.6 E+H/s in November to 38.5 E+H/s in December. The new hashrate also represented a 22% increase from 31.5 E+H/s in December 2024. The average operating hashrate in November was 34.6 E+H/s and 34.9 E+H/s in December 2025, representing a MoM increase of just 1%. Meanwhile, the average operating hashrate had increased by 27% YoY from December 2024’s 27.4 E+H/s. Riot also benefited from the surge in power and demand response credits. Power credits rose from just $1 million in November to $ 4.9 million in December, representing a 381% increase MoM. The power credits increased 549% YoY from December 2024’s $0.8 million. On the other hand, demand response credits remained almost the same MoM at $1.3 million (+2%). However, the YoY increase was a bit significant, rising 64% from $0.8 million in December 2024. Meanwhile, Riot’s total power credits also surged 171% MoM from $2.3 million in November to $6.2 million in December, and 301% YoY from $1.5 million in December 2024. The company’s all-in power cost declined by 1% MoM to 3.9 cents per KW/h (kilowatt hour). The YoY fleet efficiency also showed an improvement at 20.2 J/TH.

This comprehensive Bitcoin price prediction analysis explores the complex interplay of technological developments, regulatory frameworks, and macroeconomic factors that will likely influence BTC’s valuation from 2026 through 2030. Historical data from previous market cycles provides crucial context for understanding potential future movements, while current institutional adoption trends offer additional insight into Bitcoin’s evolving role within global finance. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Professional analysts typically employ multiple methodologies when creating Bitcoin price predictions. These approaches include quantitative models based on historical volatility, network fundamentals analysis examining metrics like hash rate and active addresses, and comparative studies with traditional asset classes. The stock-to-flow model, while controversial, has gained attention for its previous correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements relative to its programmed scarcity. However, most experts emphasize that no single model can perfectly predict cryptocurrency markets, which remain influenced by unpredictable technological breakthroughs and regulatory developments. Historical context proves essential for understanding Bitcoin’s potential future. The cryptocurrency has experienced four-year cycles often correlated with its halving events, where mining rewards decrease by 50%. Previous cycles in 2012, 2016, and 2020 preceded significant price appreciation approximately 12-18 months following each halving. The 2024 halving event provides a reference point for analyzing the 2026-2030 period, though analysts caution that past performance never guarantees future results in such a rapidly evolving asset class. Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin’s 2026-2030 Valuation Several fundamental factors will likely determine Bitcoin’s price trajectory through the latter half of the decade. Institutional adoption represents perhaps the most significant variable, with major financial institutions increasingly integrating Bitcoin into investment products and treasury reserves. Regulatory clarity across major economies will either facilitate or hinder this institutional participation. Meanwhile, technological developments like the Lightning Network’s expansion and potential protocol upgrades could enhance Bitcoin’s utility and transaction efficiency. Macroeconomic Environment and Monetary Policy Impact Global monetary policy decisions will substantially influence Bitcoin’s valuation through 2030. Central bank actions regarding interest rates, quantitative easing programs, and currency debasement concerns often correlate with increased interest in decentralized assets. Historically, expansionary monetary policies have coincided with heightened cryptocurrency investment as investors seek inflation-resistant stores of value. The relationship between traditional financial markets and digital assets continues to evolve, with increasing correlation during periods of market stress potentially affecting Bitcoin’s diversification benefits. Demographic trends also favor long-term Bitcoin adoption. Younger generations show significantly higher cryptocurrency acceptance rates than older cohorts. As wealth transfers to these digitally-native populations accelerate through the decade, Bitcoin could experience sustained demand growth. Furthermore, developing nations with unstable national currencies continue exploring Bitcoin as both a transactional medium and value preservation tool, potentially creating new adoption vectors beyond speculative investment. Expert Analysis and Consensus Forecast Ranges Financial institutions and research firms have published varied Bitcoin price predictions for the 2026-2030 period. These forecasts typically range from conservative estimates of $100,000-$150,000 by 2030 to more optimistic projections exceeding $500,000. Major investment banks increasingly include cryptocurrency analysis in their annual outlook reports, though methodologies and assumptions differ significantly between firms. Independent analysts often emphasize Bitcoin’s network effects and Metcalfe’s Law, which suggests a network’s value increases proportionally to the square of its users. The table below summarizes selected institutional Bitcoin price predictions for 2030: Institution/Analyst 2030 Price Prediction Key Assumptions Standard Chartered $200,000 ETF inflows, reserve asset status ARK Invest $1,000,000+ Institutional allocation reaching 5% Bloomberg Intelligence $100,000-$150,000 Gradual adoption as digital gold Fidelity Digital Assets Not specified Network fundamentals improvement Notably, these predictions assume continued network security, absence of catastrophic regulatory actions in major economies, and no fundamental technological vulnerabilities emerging in Bitcoin’s protocol. Analysts universally emphasize the high volatility and uncertainty inherent in such long-term cryptocurrency forecasts. Technological Developments and Protocol Evolution Bitcoin’s underlying technology continues evolving through community-driven development. Several potential upgrades could significantly impact Bitcoin’s utility and valuation through 2030. The Lightning Network’s expansion enables faster, cheaper transactions, potentially increasing Bitcoin’s use for everyday payments. Taproot improvements enhance privacy and smart contract capabilities, while sidechain developments like Liquid Network facilitate faster settlements for institutional participants. Mining economics will undergo substantial changes through the decade. The 2028 halving event will reduce block rewards to 1.5625 BTC, potentially affecting miner profitability and network security if transaction fees don’t sufficiently compensate. Renewable energy integration in mining operations continues accelerating, potentially addressing environmental concerns that have limited institutional participation. Quantum computing developments represent both a potential threat to cryptographic security and an opportunity for protocol upgrades, with developers already researching quantum-resistant algorithms. Regulatory Landscape and Institutional Integration Regulatory clarity represents perhaps the most significant variable for Bitcoin’s 2026-2030 trajectory. Major economies continue developing comprehensive cryptocurrency frameworks, with outcomes ranging from supportive infrastructure development to restrictive measures. Clear regulations typically reduce uncertainty and facilitate institutional participation, while ambiguous or hostile regulatory environments can limit adoption and innovation. International coordination through organizations like the Financial Stability Board and International Monetary Fund will likely influence national approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. Institutional integration continues progressing across multiple sectors. Traditional finance increasingly offers Bitcoin-related products including: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) providing regulated exposure Custody solutions from major financial institutions Payment integration by fintech companies Corporate treasury allocations as inflation hedges Retirement account options through specialized providers This institutional infrastructure development typically reduces volatility and increases market depth, potentially making Bitcoin more attractive to conservative investors through the latter half of the decade. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Assets Bitcoin’s evolving correlation with traditional assets provides insight into its potential role within diversified portfolios through 2030. Initially exhibiting near-zero correlation with stocks and bonds, Bitcoin has shown increasing correlation during periods of market stress, particularly following increased institutional participation. This changing relationship affects portfolio construction decisions and risk management approaches. Gold often serves as the most frequent comparison, with Bitcoin increasingly described as “digital gold” due to its scarcity characteristics and potential inflation-hedging properties. Market capitalization comparisons offer perspective on Bitcoin’s growth potential. Surpassing $1 trillion in market capitalization during previous bull markets, Bitcoin remains significantly smaller than traditional asset classes like global equities ($100+ trillion) or bonds ($130+ trillion). Even modest allocation shifts from these massive markets could substantially impact Bitcoin’s valuation. However, critics note that valuation metrics for cryptocurrencies differ fundamentally from traditional assets, lacking conventional measures like cash flow or dividend yields that typically anchor traditional asset valuations. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 involve numerous variables including technological developments, regulatory decisions, institutional adoption rates, and macroeconomic conditions. While optimistic projections suggest substantial appreciation potential, investors should approach long-term cryptocurrency forecasts with appropriate caution given the asset class’s volatility and evolving fundamentals. The Bitcoin price prediction landscape continues maturing as more traditional financial analysis frameworks apply to digital assets, yet unique characteristics of decentralized technologies require specialized understanding. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s trajectory through the latter half of the decade will likely depend on its continued evolution from speculative asset toward established financial infrastructure with clear utility and regulatory acceptance. FAQs Q1: What is the most reliable method for Bitcoin price prediction? No single method proves completely reliable for Bitcoin price prediction due to cryptocurrency market complexity. Most analysts combine multiple approaches including historical pattern analysis, network fundamentals examination, and macroeconomic factor assessment while acknowledging substantial uncertainty. Q2: How does Bitcoin’s halving cycle affect long-term price predictions? Bitcoin’s approximately four-year halving cycle reduces new supply issuance by 50%, historically correlating with subsequent price appreciation. However, analysts debate whether this relationship will persist as Bitcoin matures and other factors gain importance. Q3: What regulatory developments could most impact Bitcoin’s 2030 price? Clear regulatory frameworks in major economies like the United States and European Union could facilitate institutional participation, while restrictive measures or outright bans in significant markets could substantially limit adoption and valuation. Q4: How do institutional investments affect Bitcoin price predictions? Institutional participation typically increases market depth, reduces volatility, and establishes stronger price discovery mechanisms. Significant institutional allocation could support higher valuations but might also increase correlation with traditional markets. Q5: What technological risks could affect Bitcoin’s long-term valuation? Potential technological risks include quantum computing breakthroughs compromising cryptographic security, protocol vulnerabilities, scalability limitations, and competition from alternative cryptocurrencies with different technical approaches or governance models.

56922444,654261,1767762007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56922444.jpeg,"Bitcoin ‘Record’ LTH Selling Inflated By Exchange Transfers, CryptoQuant Head Says",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-record-lth-selling-cryptoquant-head-says/,bitcoinist,"CryptoQuant’s head of research has highlighted how the recent high levels of Bitcoin HODLer selling were inflated by internal exchange moves. Recent Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Selling Hasn’t Been At True Record Levels In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research, Julio Moreno, has talked about the recent selloff from the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) . The LTHs refer to investors who have been holding onto their coins for a period longer than 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor keeps their tokens dormant, the less likely they are to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs with their long holding times are considered to include the resolute hands of the market that are unlikely to part with their coins. That said, there are times when these diamond hands do take to selling. One major such selloff occurred in November of this year, as the chart shared by Moreno shows. At the height of the Bitcoin LTH distribution in November, the 30-day sum of spending hit a record high of 1.55 million BTC. The analyst has pointed out, however, that this figure doesn’t tell the entire story. The value of the LTH distribution doesn’t exclude sources that don’t correspond to economic transactions. For example, internal wallet moves . It turns out that such transfers skewed the market picture notably this time around. “A significant portion of LTH spending was due to exchange internal transactions,” explained Moreno. According to CryptoQuant data, at least 0.65 million of the “HODLer selling” actually corresponded to internal wallet shuffling from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase . Thus, the distribution from the group didn’t quite reach the levels that could be considered as new records. This wasn’t the first time that internal exchange transactions exaggerated LTH selling. As is visible in the chart, there was a sharp spike in Coinbase’s internal transfers of LTH-aged coins back in December 2018 as well. While adjusting for internal Coinbase shuffling lessens the scale of the latest diamond hand selloff, it doesn’t quite eliminate it. The monthly LTH spending still hit a notable level of 0.9 million BTC at the peak in November. The only time in the current cycle that the metric exceeded this mark was in December 2024. In fact, as the chart below displays, this selloff was the fifth highest on record. The record for the highest amount of Bitcoin LTH selling is still maintained by August 2017, which witnessed 1.4 million BTC in movements from the cohort. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $93,800, up almost 7% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Internal Exchange Transfers|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin Selling|btc|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56922894,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259239,1767766511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japanese Bond Yields Soar: Unprecedented BTC Volatility Looms in Global Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japanese-bond-yields-btc-volatility/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Japanese Bond Yields Soar: Unprecedented BTC Volatility Looms in Global Markets TOKYO, March 2025 – Global financial markets face mounting pressure as Japanese government bond yields reach multi-year highs, creating potential turbulence for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency valuations worldwide. This significant development follows consecutive interest rate adjustments by the Bank of Japan, marking a historic shift in monetary policy that could fundamentally alter international capital flows. Market analysts now closely monitor how these rising yields might heighten BTC volatility through complex transmission mechanisms affecting global liquidity conditions. Understanding the Japanese Bond Yield Surge The Bank of Japan initiated its first interest rate hike cycle in over two decades during early 2024, fundamentally altering global financial dynamics. Consequently, yields on benchmark 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) have climbed approximately 150 basis points since January, while 30-year bond yields have increased even more dramatically. This upward trajectory represents the most substantial yield movement in Japanese debt markets since the 2013 “Abenomics” volatility period. Several interconnected factors drive this yield surge. First, the Bank of Japan’s policy normalization reflects growing confidence in sustainable inflation after decades of deflationary pressure. Second, global inflationary trends have compelled central banks worldwide to adjust monetary policies. Third, Japan’s aging demographic profile creates structural pressures on government finances, influencing long-term yield expectations. These developments collectively reshape risk perceptions across international investment portfolios. The Yen Carry Trade Mechanism Explained For decades, the yen carry trade has served as a cornerstone of global market liquidity. This strategy involves borrowing Japanese yen at historically low interest rates, converting those funds into other currencies, and investing in higher-yielding assets worldwide. The substantial interest rate differential between Japan and other developed economies made this trade exceptionally profitable, particularly when Japanese rates remained near zero while other central banks maintained higher benchmark rates. The mechanics of this trade involve several key participants: Hedge funds seeking leveraged returns across multiple asset classes Global investment banks facilitating currency swaps and derivatives Institutional investors diversifying portfolios with international exposure Proprietary trading desks exploiting temporary market inefficiencies As Japanese yields rise, the fundamental economics of this trade deteriorate significantly. Higher borrowing costs reduce potential profits, while increased volatility raises risk premiums. Market participants must now reassess their positions, potentially triggering substantial capital reallocation across global markets. Historical Precedents and Market Reactions Financial historians recall similar episodes when Japanese monetary policy shifts created global market turbulence. The 2006-2007 unwinding of yen carry trades contributed to volatility preceding the global financial crisis. More recently, in late 2023, initial signals of Japanese monetary tightening preceded a 15% Bitcoin price correction within two weeks, demonstrating cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to these macroeconomic forces. Analysis of market data reveals consistent patterns. When Japanese yield differentials narrow by 50 basis points or more, cryptocurrency markets typically experience volatility spikes exceeding 30% above their 30-day averages. This correlation has strengthened as institutional cryptocurrency participation has grown, creating stronger linkages between traditional finance and digital asset markets. Transmission to Cryptocurrency Markets Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies increasingly respond to traditional financial market signals as institutional adoption expands. The potential unwinding of yen carry trades could affect cryptocurrency markets through multiple transmission channels. First, reduced global liquidity might decrease available capital for speculative cryptocurrency investments. Second, risk aversion among institutional investors could prompt portfolio rebalancing away from volatile assets. Third, currency market volatility might increase hedging costs for international cryptocurrency traders. Market structure analysis reveals specific vulnerability points: Cryptocurrency Market Exposure to Yen Carry Trade Unwinding Transmission Channel Potential Impact Historical Evidence Liquidity Reduction Decreased trading volumes and increased bid-ask spreads 2018 cryptocurrency bear market correlation with quantitative tightening Risk Repricing Higher volatility premiums and reduced leverage availability March 2020 liquidity crisis affecting cryptocurrency margins Currency Effects Japanese yen strength reducing local cryptocurrency purchasing power 2015 Swiss franc unpegging and Bitcoin price movements Furthermore, cryptocurrency derivatives markets show particular sensitivity to these developments. Open interest in Bitcoin futures and options frequently correlates with global dollar liquidity measures, which themselves connect to yen funding conditions. Options pricing data already indicates rising volatility expectations among sophisticated market participants anticipating further Japanese monetary policy adjustments. Global Financial Market Interconnections The Japanese bond market’s influence extends far beyond Asia, creating ripple effects across multiple asset classes. European government bonds have shown increased correlation with Japanese yields since the policy shift began. Similarly, U.S. Treasury markets experience indirect pressure as international investors reassess relative value across developed market sovereign debt. These interconnected movements create complex feedback loops affecting all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Several key indicators merit close monitoring: USD/JPY exchange rate volatility as a proxy for carry trade dynamics Global dollar funding costs measured through cross-currency basis swaps Risk appetite indicators like the VIX and cryptocurrency fear/greed indexes Japanese investor portfolio flows into international assets Market participants report increasing correlation between these traditional financial indicators and cryptocurrency price movements. This developing relationship suggests cryptocurrency markets now integrate more fully into global capital allocation decisions, rather than operating as isolated speculative arenas. Expert Perspectives on Market Evolution Financial economists emphasize structural changes in market relationships. “The traditional separation between cryptocurrency and traditional finance continues to erode,” notes Dr. Akiko Tanaka, Professor of International Finance at Tokyo University. “Our research shows cryptocurrency volatility now responds to global liquidity conditions with approximately 40% of the sensitivity observed in emerging market equities, representing a significant increase from just two years ago.” Market practitioners observe similar developments. “We’ve adjusted our volatility models to incorporate Japanese yield movements as a secondary input,” explains Michael Chen, Head of Quantitative Strategy at Global Digital Assets Fund. “While the relationship isn’t perfectly linear, the directional impact has become statistically significant since 2023, particularly during periods of rapid monetary policy adjustment.” Potential Scenarios and Market Implications Financial analysts outline several plausible scenarios based on current market conditions. In a gradual adjustment scenario, Japanese yields continue rising moderately while the Bank of Japan provides clear forward guidance, potentially limiting cryptocurrency volatility to 20-30% above recent averages. Alternatively, a rapid unwinding scenario involving sudden capital repatriation could trigger cryptocurrency volatility spikes exceeding 50%, particularly if combined with broader risk-off sentiment in traditional markets. Market participants should consider several risk management strategies: Diversification across cryptocurrency sectors with different sensitivity profiles Dynamic position sizing based on volatility regime indicators Enhanced monitoring of traditional financial market signals Stress testing portfolios against various yield curve scenarios Regulatory developments add additional complexity. Japanese financial authorities continue developing cryptocurrency framework enhancements, potentially influencing market structure and participant behavior. International coordination through organizations like the Financial Stability Board and International Monetary Fund could further shape how cryptocurrency markets interact with traditional finance during periods of monetary policy transition. Conclusion The relationship between Japanese bond yields and BTC volatility represents a significant development in global financial market integration. As monetary policy normalization continues in Japan, cryptocurrency market participants must increasingly consider traditional financial indicators when assessing risk and opportunity. While historical patterns suggest potential volatility increases, the evolving market structure creates both challenges and opportunities for informed investors. Continued monitoring of Japanese monetary policy developments, combined with analysis of transmission mechanisms to cryptocurrency markets, remains essential for navigating this complex financial landscape in 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the yen carry trade and why does it matter for cryptocurrencies? The yen carry trade involves borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets globally. This trade matters for cryptocurrencies because it affects global liquidity conditions. When the trade unwinds due to rising Japanese yields, it reduces available capital that might otherwise flow into speculative assets like Bitcoin, potentially heightening BTC volatility. Q2: How quickly could rising Japanese bond yields affect Bitcoin prices? Market reactions can occur within days or weeks, as demonstrated in late 2023 when Bitcoin experienced a 15% price drop following initial Japanese rate hike signals. The speed depends on how rapidly institutional investors adjust their global portfolios and whether the yield movements trigger broader risk aversion across financial markets. Q3: Are all cryptocurrencies equally affected by these macroeconomic developments? No, different cryptocurrencies show varying sensitivity. Bitcoin and Ethereum typically demonstrate stronger correlations with traditional financial indicators due to greater institutional ownership. Smaller altcoins may show less direct correlation but can experience amplified volatility during broader market stress periods. Q4: What indicators should investors watch to anticipate volatility changes? Key indicators include Japanese Government Bond yield movements, USD/JPY exchange rate volatility, global dollar funding costs through cross-currency basis swaps, and risk appetite measures like the VIX index. Additionally, monitoring Japanese investor portfolio flow data provides insights into capital allocation decisions. Q5: Could this situation create buying opportunities despite increased volatility? Historically, periods of heightened volatility have created both risks and opportunities. Disciplined investors might find attractive entry points during market overreactions, though careful risk management remains essential. The fundamental cryptocurrency adoption trajectory continues alongside these macroeconomic developments, creating potential long-term opportunities despite short-term volatility.

The gradual transfer of wealth from older, more crypto-averse generations to younger, tech-savvy heirs could reshape investment preferences over the coming decades. Speaking on Tuesday during an episode of the Milk Road show, Zac Prince, head of Galaxy Digital’s banking venture Galaxy One, said the eventual redistribution of wealth could benefit the crypto industry. As assets move into the hands of younger generations, he argued, their investment preferences are likely to play a larger role in financial markets. “I see a lot of stuff about how like younger people are getting screwed because older people are holding all the money,” Prince said. He added that a wealth transfer will eventually begin, and when it does, “the preferences of younger folks are going to matter more.” Generational wealth transfer in focus The scale of the potential shift is significant. Investment bank UBS estimated in its 2025 global wealth report that Americans collectively hold around $163 trillion in wealth. Baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964 — account for more than half of that total, with $83.3 trillion in assets. As this wealth is gradually passed on, even a small reallocation toward alternative assets could have an outsized impact on markets such as crypto. While the process is likely to unfold over many years, industry participants see it as a structural tailwind rather than a short-term catalyst. Data suggests that younger investors already show greater willingness to hold crypto and other non-traditional assets. A fourth-quarter State of Crypto report from Coinbase found that about 25% of younger traders said they held assets such as crypto, derivatives, or private investments. That compares with just 8% among older investors. Technology and investment preferences Prince also pointed to younger generations’ familiarity with technology as another factor that could support crypto adoption. He argued that modern trading platforms and financial apps align more closely with how younger investors prefer to manage their money. Newer tools often allow near-instant trading and access to multiple financial products through a single, intuitive interface. Prince contrasted this with more traditional models, where investors might need to call a broker or schedule a meeting with a financial adviser to execute trades. He said these technological trends favor digital-first asset classes such as crypto. This combination of technological comfort and shifting wealth could, over time, make crypto a more mainstream component of investment portfolios, particularly among younger demographics. Older investors show signs of interest While younger investors are more likely to hold crypto, some evidence suggests that older generations may also be warming to the asset class. A survey released in April last year by Australian exchange CoinSpot found that 38.5% of Australians aged over 60 said they were open to investing in crypto in the future. That figure was close to the national average of 37.8%. Additional data from the Australian exchange Independent Reserve also points to growing interest among older investors. Its 2024 survey found that crypto ownership among people aged over 65 tripled to 6% between 2019 and 2024. Taken together, these trends suggest that while generational change may be a key driver of long-term crypto adoption, openness to digital assets is gradually spreading across age groups.

Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported this significant transaction, which originated from three linked addresses just ten hours ago. This move immediately captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, prompting deep scrutiny of its timing and potential implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory as we progress through 2025. Consequently, the market is now evaluating whether this signals a pivotal shift in sentiment among large-scale holders. Analyzing the $280 Million Bitcoin Whale Purchase Lookonchain, a respected on-chain intelligence platform, identified the coordinated activity. The firm’s analysis suggests three separate blockchain addresses, likely controlled by one entity, acquired a total of 3,000 BTC. Notably, the purchase occurred over a short period, indicating a deliberate accumulation strategy rather than gradual buying. Market data confirms the average purchase price hovered around $93,333 per Bitcoin, aligning with the prevailing market rate at the time of the transactions. Furthermore, such concentrated buying pressure from a single source can provide substantial support to the asset’s price floor, especially during periods of consolidation. To understand the scale, consider this comparison of recent notable whale accumulations: Date Entity/Report BTC Purchased Approx. Value (USD) Q4 2024 Institutional Fund A 1,200 BTC $110M January 2025 Corporate Treasury B 800 BTC $75M Today (Reported) Anonymous Whale 3,000 BTC $280M This transaction stands out for its sheer size and execution speed. Typically, whales employ sophisticated methods to mask their activity, but coordinated buys across linked addresses often leave a detectable pattern. Therefore, analysts use these patterns to gauge whale sentiment, a key on-chain metric. The Strategic Context of Major BTC Accumulation Understanding this purchase requires examining the broader market context. Bitcoin has recently experienced a period of relative stability following the heightened volatility associated with the 2024 halving event. Historically, accumulation by large holders often precedes significant price movements. Several strategic reasons could explain this whale’s actions: Long-Term Holding (HODLing): The whale may believe Bitcoin is fundamentally undervalued and is building a position for a multi-year horizon. Institutional Entry: The entity could be a proxy for an institutional investor entering the market discreetly. Portfolio Rebalancing: A large fund might be increasing its crypto allocation as a hedge against traditional market inflation. Market Sentiment Signal: Such a public move can itself influence market psychology, encouraging other investors to buy. Moreover, the purchase occurred without triggering major price spikes, suggesting the whale used over-the-counter (OTC) desks or carefully split orders across exchanges. This method minimizes market impact and demonstrates sophisticated execution. Ultimately, the timing aligns with a period where macroeconomic uncertainty persists, reinforcing Bitcoin’s narrative as ‘digital gold.’ Expert Insights on Whale Behavior and Market Impact Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the importance of whale movements. “Whale accumulation at this scale is a strong confidence indicator,” notes a veteran market strategist from a top blockchain analytics firm. “We monitor these flows closely because they often represent ‘smart money’ positioning ahead of major catalysts. The lack of subsequent selling pressure is equally crucial.” Evidence from past cycles supports this view. For instance, sustained whale accumulation in late 2020 preceded the bull run of 2021. Key metrics analysts now watch include: Exchange Netflow: Whether the BTC moved to private custody (bullish) or to exchanges for potential selling (bearish). Wallet Age Bands: Monitoring if old whales are distributing or new whales are forming. Realized Price: The average price at which the acquired coins last moved, indicating profit/loss thresholds. Initial data suggests this whale moved the purchased BTC into deep cold storage, a strongly bullish signal for long-term holding intent. Consequently, the market often interprets such custody moves as a reduction in immediate sell-side pressure. Potential Implications for the 2025 Cryptocurrency Market This $280 million purchase carries several potential implications for Bitcoin and the broader digital asset market. First, it provides a substantial volume-based support level near the $93,000 price point. If the whale holds, this zone could become a strong defense against downward price movements. Second, it may inspire other large-scale investors to evaluate their own positions, potentially leading to follow-on accumulation. The transaction also highlights the growing maturity of market infrastructure. The ability to execute a trade of this size efficiently points to improved liquidity and advanced trading tools available to major players. However, it also underscores the concentration of Bitcoin wealth, a perennial topic of discussion regarding network decentralization. Regardless, the immediate effect has been a noticeable shift in trader sentiment on social and derivatives platforms, with funding rates and fear/greed indices adjusting positively. Conclusion The stunning $280 million Bitcoin whale purchase of 3,000 BTC represents a significant event in the 2025 cryptocurrency landscape. This transaction, meticulously tracked by on-chain analysts, demonstrates profound confidence from a major market participant at a critical juncture. While the identity of the whale remains unknown, the action’s scale, timing, and execution speak volumes. It reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset for large portfolios and provides a tangible data point for bullish market thesis. Moving forward, the market will closely watch for any distribution from this address, as its holding behavior will remain a key barometer of high-net-worth investor sentiment toward Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘Bitcoin whale’? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of Bitcoin to potentially influence the market’s price through their trades. There is no official threshold, but addresses holding over 1,000 BTC are generally considered whales. Q2: How do analysts know the three addresses belong to the same whale? Blockchain analysts use heuristic clustering. They examine patterns like funding sources (common input ownership), simultaneous transaction timing, and behavioral fingerprints. If multiple addresses receive funds from the same source or act in unison repeatedly, they are likely controlled by a single entity. Q3: Does a large whale purchase guarantee the Bitcoin price will rise? Not necessarily. While it indicates strong buying pressure and confidence, price is influenced by many factors including broader macroeconomics, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. However, large accumulations historically correlate with stronger long-term price foundations. Q4: What is the difference between an OTC trade and an exchange trade for a whale? An over-the-counter (OTC) trade is a private, bilateral agreement to buy/sell large amounts directly, often at a negotiated price. It avoids moving the public market price. An exchange trade executes orders on a public order book, which can cause significant price slippage and visibility for large orders. Q5: Why is moving BTC to ‘cold storage’ considered a bullish signal? Moving BTC to a cold storage wallet (an offline device) signals an intent to hold the asset long-term, removing it from immediate circulation on exchanges where it could be sold. This reduces the readily available supply on the market, which is a fundamentally bullish dynamic if demand remains constant or increases.

Several altcoins have posted some gains over the past day, including ETH, which has risen to $3,250, and BNB, which has tapped $920. BTC Goes Up and Down and Up The start of the year brought some gains for the bulls as the primary cryptocurrency quickly erased some of the late December 2025 losses and reclaimed the $90,000 level on Friday. It reaffirmed its position above that line during the weekend, as even the attacks from the United States against Venezuela couldn’t shake it up for long. The business week began with another rally that pushed bitcoin to $93,000 by late Monday. Hours later, the cryptocurrency tapped a multi-week peak of almost $95,000 as the bulls seemed in complete control. However, that changed throughout the trading day, and BTC slumped below $91,500 at one point after another rejection at $94,500. More volatility ensued, with bitcoin jumping to $93,800, where it was stopped and now sits just inches below $93,000. Its market capitalization, though, has returned to $1.850 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins has declined by over 1% in the past few weeks to 56.5% on CG. BTCUSD Jan 7. Source: TradingView XRP Rejected, RAIN Pumps Ripple’s cross-border token was among the top performers yesterday, having surged by double digits to a multi-month peak at just over $2.40 at one point. However, it was also stopped there and slipped to $2.20 before it found some relief at $2.28 as of now. ZEC, XLM, and SIU are also slightly in the red from the other larger-cap alts. In contrast, ETH has jumped to $2,500 after a 1% daily increase, while BNB is close to $920. SOL has tapped $140, while XMR is above $455. RAIN and M have marked the biggest gains over the past 24 hours. The total crypto market cap has lost around $25 billion since this time yesterday and is down to $3.275 trillion on CG.

Bitcoin Perps Funding Rates Have Surged In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Funding Rates for the major perpetual futures markets. The “Funding Rate” is an indicator that measures the amount of periodic fees that traders on the futures market are exchanging between each other on a given derivatives platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation: Data Shows Institutions Are Net Buyers Again When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long holders are paying a premium to the shorts in order to hold onto their position. Such a trend implies a bullish mentality is dominant in the market. On the other hand, the indicator being below the zero mark suggests the shorts outweigh the longs and a bearish sentiment is shared by the majority of traders on the exchange. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Funding Rate for major exchanges over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Funding Rate has witnessed an increase across these platforms recently, indicating that investors have been setting up fresh bullish positions. The mean Funding Rate for these exchanges dropped to the 0% mark back in November as the cryptocurrency’s price went through a crash. As the asset settled into its consolidation phase, investors gradually set up longs, culminating in the indicator recovering to 0.005%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Ends: Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal In the last 24 hours, however, the mean Funding Rate has retraced back to 0.003%, implying some investors have closed up their long positions after the latest recovery rally and/or others have set up shorts to bet against the bullish price action. In the past, major rallies have tended to occur alongside notable positive Funding Rates on the different exchanges. According to Glassnode, the threshold has generally lied at 0.001%. Since the mean Funding Rate is still below this level, the analytics firm has noted, “current conditions remain supportive but not yet decisive.” BTC Broke Above $94,000 Before Retracing Down Bitcoin has seen the renewal of bullish momentum recently, with its price recovering as high as $94,700, but the past day has seen a setback for the digital asset as it’s now back at $92,100. Other cryptocurrencies have also been volatile to varying degrees in the past day, which has resulted in liquidations of over $500 million on the derivatives exchanges, as data from CoinGlass shows. Out of these $503 million in liquidations, about $146 million of the positions involved were Bitcoin-related ones.

According to Jacobs, the pioneering cryptocurrency remains firmly in its early stages despite nearly sixteen years of market existence. This assessment from one of the world’s largest asset managers provides crucial context for understanding Bitcoin’s evolving role in global finance. Bitcoin’s Early Stage Development Analysis Jay Jacobs’ characterization of Bitcoin as an early-stage asset carries substantial weight within financial circles. BlackRock manages approximately $10 trillion in assets globally, giving their executives’ perspectives particular authority. Furthermore, Jacobs oversees active exchange-traded funds, positioning him uniquely to assess emerging asset classes. His comments emerged during a broader discussion about digital asset integration within traditional portfolios. Market analysts immediately noted the significance of this timing. Bitcoin recently surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching approximately $95,000 in February 2025. Despite this milestone, Jacobs emphasized that adoption metrics suggest considerable room for growth. He specifically referenced institutional participation rates, which currently hover around 15% among major financial institutions according to recent Fidelity research. Several key indicators support Jacobs’ early-stage assessment: Global Adoption Rates: Only 4% of the world’s population holds Bitcoin directly Institutional Holdings: Traditional institutions control less than 8% of Bitcoin’s total supply Regulatory Clarity: Comprehensive regulatory frameworks remain incomplete in most jurisdictions Infrastructure Development: Custodial and trading infrastructure continues evolving rapidly Historical Context and Market Evolution Understanding Bitcoin’s current position requires examining its developmental trajectory. Launched anonymously in 2009, Bitcoin initially functioned as a technological experiment. The cryptocurrency gradually transitioned through several distinct phases, each marked by increasing sophistication. Early adopters primarily consisted of technologists and cryptography enthusiasts during the first five years. The market witnessed its first major institutional interest around 2017 when Bitcoin approached $20,000. However, this period represented speculative retail trading rather than genuine institutional adoption. Subsequent years brought improved infrastructure, including regulated futures markets and custody solutions. These developments enabled more traditional investors to participate securely. BlackRock’s own journey with Bitcoin provides telling context. The firm launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in January 2024, following regulatory approval. This product quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches in history, accumulating over $25 billion in assets within twelve months. This rapid adoption demonstrates accelerating institutional interest while simultaneously highlighting how recently this participation began. Bitcoin Adoption Timeline: Key Milestones Year Milestone Significance 2009 Bitcoin Genesis Block Network launch and first transaction 2013 First Major Price Rally Initial mainstream media attention 2017 CME Bitcoin Futures First regulated derivatives product 2020 Corporate Treasury Adoption MicroStrategy and Tesla allocations 2024 Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Major regulatory milestone for accessibility Institutional Adoption Patterns and Metrics Jacobs specifically referenced adoption patterns when discussing Bitcoin’s early-stage status. Traditional asset classes typically follow predictable adoption curves, beginning with innovators and early adopters before reaching critical mass. According to research from ARK Invest, Bitcoin currently resides in the early adopter phase. This positioning suggests the majority of potential users have yet to engage with the asset. Several quantitative metrics support this assessment. Daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network number approximately 900,000, representing less than 0.1% of global internet users. Transaction volumes, while growing steadily, remain fractional compared to traditional payment networks. Additionally, Bitcoin’s market capitalization of $1.8 trillion represents just 1.2% of global gold’s value, indicating substantial growth potential. Financial infrastructure development provides another crucial indicator. While significant progress has occurred, many traditional financial institutions still lack direct Bitcoin exposure. Pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies collectively manage over $100 trillion globally, yet their Bitcoin allocations remain minimal. This gradual adoption pattern aligns with Jacobs’ characterization of early-stage development. Regulatory Environment and Future Development The regulatory landscape significantly influences Bitcoin’s developmental stage. Comprehensive frameworks continue emerging across major jurisdictions, creating clearer pathways for institutional participation. The United States approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, while the European Union implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in 2025. These developments reduce uncertainty for traditional investors. However, regulatory harmonization remains incomplete globally. Asia presents a particularly varied landscape, with Japan embracing cryptocurrency while China maintains restrictions. This regulatory fragmentation creates complexity for multinational institutions seeking standardized approaches. As frameworks mature, they will likely facilitate broader adoption among conservative investors who require regulatory clarity. Technological developments also factor into Bitcoin’s developmental assessment. The Lightning Network, a second-layer scaling solution, continues expanding its capacity and usability. This technology enables faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining Bitcoin’s security guarantees. Such innovations address early criticisms regarding scalability, potentially accelerating adoption among payment-focused users. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Assets Comparing Bitcoin’s development to traditional assets provides valuable perspective. Equities markets required centuries to reach their current sophistication level, with modern stock exchanges emerging in the 17th century. Gold, often cited as Bitcoin’s analog, has served as a store of value for millennia. Against this historical backdrop, Bitcoin’s sixteen-year existence appears remarkably brief. Even more recent asset classes demonstrate extended development timelines. Exchange-traded funds first emerged in 1993 but required nearly two decades to achieve widespread adoption. Today, global ETF assets exceed $12 trillion, demonstrating how new financial instruments can experience prolonged growth phases. Bitcoin’s trajectory may follow similar patterns, with gradual adoption preceding exponential growth. Market structure evolution provides another comparative lens. Bitcoin initially traded on unregulated exchanges with limited oversight. The market has since developed sophisticated derivatives, custody solutions, and regulatory frameworks. This progression mirrors traditional financial market development, albeit at an accelerated pace. Each improvement facilitates participation from increasingly conservative investor segments. Global Economic Context and Bitcoin’s Role Macroeconomic conditions significantly influence Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory. Persistent inflation concerns, currency devaluation risks, and geopolitical uncertainties have increased demand for alternative stores of value. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature offer unique characteristics within this environment. These attributes attract investors seeking diversification beyond traditional assets. Developing economies present particularly interesting adoption patterns. Countries experiencing currency instability or capital controls increasingly turn to Bitcoin as an alternative financial system. This grassroots adoption complements institutional interest, creating multi-layered growth dynamics. Such diverse adoption drivers suggest Bitcoin’s development may follow unconventional patterns compared to traditional assets. Technological convergence represents another crucial factor. The integration of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Internet of Things devices, and decentralized finance creates novel use cases. These developments extend Bitcoin’s utility beyond simple value storage, potentially accelerating adoption across various sectors. This technological integration remains in early stages, supporting Jacobs’ assessment. Conclusion Jay Jacobs’ characterization of Bitcoin as an early-stage asset carries significant implications for investors and market observers. Despite substantial progress since 2009, multiple indicators suggest considerable growth potential remains. Institutional adoption, while accelerating, remains in its infancy relative to traditional asset classes. Regulatory frameworks continue evolving toward greater clarity and standardization. The Bitcoin market demonstrates remarkable resilience and adaptability throughout its development. Each challenge has prompted technological innovation and infrastructure improvement. As these developments continue, Bitcoin’s role within global finance will likely expand beyond current applications. Jacobs’ perspective from BlackRock provides valuable insight into how traditional finance views this evolving asset class. Market participants should recognize that early-stage positioning implies both opportunity and uncertainty. While growth potential appears substantial, development pathways remain unpredictable. Careful analysis of adoption metrics, regulatory developments, and technological innovations will prove essential for understanding Bitcoin’s ongoing evolution within global markets. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Jay Jacobs say about Bitcoin’s development stage? During his CNBC interview, Jacobs stated that Bitcoin remains in its early stages of development despite its 16-year existence. He emphasized that adoption metrics and institutional participation rates support this assessment. Q2: Why does BlackRock’s perspective on Bitcoin matter? BlackRock manages approximately $10 trillion in assets, making it the world’s largest asset manager. Their analysis carries substantial weight within financial markets and influences institutional investment decisions globally. Q3: What indicators suggest Bitcoin is still in early stages? Key indicators include low global adoption rates (approximately 4% direct ownership), minimal institutional holdings (under 8% of total supply), evolving regulatory frameworks, and continuing infrastructure development. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s development compare to traditional assets? Bitcoin’s 16-year existence appears brief compared to centuries of equity market development or millennia of gold’s use as a store of value. Even modern financial instruments like ETFs required decades to achieve widespread adoption. Q5: What factors could accelerate Bitcoin’s development beyond early stages? Increased institutional adoption, regulatory harmonization across major jurisdictions, technological improvements like Lightning Network expansion, and broader integration with traditional financial systems could all accelerate development.

Meanwhile, buy orders clustered thinly below $91,800, indicating potential for further downward pressure. Historically, such breaks of round-number thresholds often precede accelerated volatility as automated trading systems react. For context, Bitcoin’s trading volume spiked by approximately 35% in the 24 hours preceding the drop. This surge in activity typically signals a decisive move driven by institutional rebalancing or leveraged position liquidations. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization followed suit, declining by an estimated 2.8% in sync with BTC’s movement. Analysts often correlate this domino effect to Bitcoin’s role as a market bellwether. Analyzing the Drivers of Cryptocurrency Market Volatility Several interconnected factors contribute to the current market volatility . Primarily, shifting expectations around global interest rate policies have impacted risk assets. Recent statements from major central banks suggest a more hawkish stance than markets had priced in for 2025. As a result, capital has rotated towards traditional safe-haven assets, applying pressure on speculative holdings like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, on-chain metrics provide crucial evidence. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator, which tracks the overall profit/loss state of the network, recently entered a zone historically associated with distribution. Similarly, exchange net flows have turned positive over the past week, meaning more BTC is moving onto exchanges—a pattern often preceding selling activity. The following table summarizes key on-chain signals from the past seven days: Metric Status Implied Market Sentiment Exchange Net Flow +12,500 BTC Increasing Selling Pressure MVRV Z-Score 1.8 Moderately Overvalued Puell Multiple 0.9 Neutral to Slightly Low Simultaneously, regulatory developments continue to influence trader sentiment. For instance, ongoing deliberations about digital asset frameworks in key economies create uncertainty. This regulatory overhang often suppresses bullish momentum until clearer guidelines emerge. Expert Perspectives on Current Trading Dynamics Market strategists emphasize the role of derivatives in amplifying the move. “The break below $92,000 likely triggered a cascade of stop-loss orders in the perpetual futures market,” notes a report from a major crypto analytics firm. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of selling. Experts also point to the options market, where a large volume of put options with strikes at $90,000 were recently purchased, indicating some traders positioned for this downturn. Moreover, comparisons to previous cycles are instructive. In 2024, a similar breakdown below a major support level led to a 15% correction before finding a durable bottom. However, each cycle possesses unique fundamentals. The current market benefits from more robust institutional infrastructure, including spot Bitcoin ETFs, which may provide a cushion against extreme downside moves. These financial products now hold over 850,000 BTC collectively, representing a significant source of structural demand. Historical Context and Potential Market Impact Bitcoin’s history is defined by periods of consolidation followed by volatile breaks. The asset has experienced over a dozen drawdowns exceeding 20% since 2020 alone. Therefore, the current 8% decline from its recent high near $100,000 remains within normal historical parameters for a bull market correction. Key levels to watch now include the 100-day moving average, currently near $88,500, and the previous cycle high of $84,000, which could act as strong support. The impact extends beyond spot markets. For example, mining economics come under pressure when price declines coincide with stable or rising hash rates and energy costs. Miners may become forced sellers to cover operational expenses, adding further supply to the market. Conversely, long-term holders, often called “HODLers,” have shown remarkable resilience. Glassnode data indicates the illiquid supply—coins held in wallets with little history of spending—continues to climb, suggesting strong conviction among core investors. Liquid Supply Shock: The percentage of BTC supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains near all-time highs. Institutional Accumulation: Public company treasuries and ETFs continue their net accumulation trend, albeit at a slower pace. Network Health: Despite the price drop, the hash rate remains robust, securing the network at record levels. Ultimately, market structure evolves through these phases. Sharp corrections often flush out excessive leverage, creating healthier foundations for the next advance. They also present accumulation opportunities for investors with longer time horizons who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition as digital gold and a decentralized monetary network. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $92,000 marks a significant technical event within the 2025 market landscape. This movement stems from a confluence of macroeconomic headwinds, derivatives market mechanics, and typical cycle volatility. While short-term sentiment may turn cautious, the underlying network fundamentals remain strong. Historical precedent suggests such corrections are a normal feature of Bitcoin’s maturation process. Market participants will now closely monitor the defense of lower support levels and on-chain holder behavior to gauge the next major directional trend for the world’s premier cryptocurrency. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $92,000? The drop resulted from several factors, including broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets, the triggering of leveraged long position liquidations, and a shift in on-chain holder behavior indicating some profit-taking. Q2: What is the key support level to watch now? Analysts are watching the $88,500 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average, and the previous cycle high of $84,000. These zones have historically provided strong support during bull market corrections. Q3: How does this drop compare to past Bitcoin corrections? This correction is relatively modest so far. Since 2020, Bitcoin has frequently experienced pullbacks of 20-30% within broader uptrends. The current decline remains within this historical volatility range. Q4: Are Bitcoin ETFs still buying during this dip? Daily flow data for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs shows a mix of inflows and outflows during volatility. While some days see net redemptions, the overall trend since their launch remains one of significant net accumulation. Q5: What should a long-term investor do during this volatility? Long-term investment strategies typically advise against reacting to short-term price swings. Many strategies focus on dollar-cost averaging or holding through cycles, as Bitcoin has historically recovered from corrections to reach new highs over multi-year timeframes.

Speaking on The Milk Road Show, Prince pointed to demographic trends as a major tailwind for crypto adoption. “ The older people are going to pass away and pass the money down to younger people, ” he explained, adding that younger investors show markedly different preferences than their parents’ generation. Prince noted these investors are “ much more familiar with platforms like the one that we have at GalaxyOne, where it’s kind of an app first. Multiple kinds of products in one place, really intuitive user interface versus the traditional, you have to pick up a phone and call your broker. “ Massive Wealth Transfer Looms UBS Global Wealth Report data reveals $83 trillion will transfer between generations over the next 20-25 years, with $9 trillion moving between spouses and $74 trillion passing to heirs. The United States alone accounts for over $29 trillion of this transfer, followed by Brazil at $9 trillion and mainland China at $5.6 trillion. Source: UBS Report Prince emphasized that wealth transfer patterns don’t strictly correlate with population size or GDP. Italy, despite having half Japan’s population and 60% of its GDP, is projected to see higher inter-generational wealth transfers due to higher savings rates and home ownership among elderly citizens. GalaxyOne is positioning itself to capitalize on this shift by targeting mass-affluent investors (roughly 20% of US households) that meet the $200,000 annual income or $1 million in net worth threshold. “ We think that that audience has some, you know, unique needs that aren’t well suited by the Robin Hoods and Coinbases of the world ,” Prince stated, highlighting white-glove customer service and curated product offerings as key differentiators. Retail Sentiment Diverges From Institutions While Prince acknowledged bearish retail sentiment at year-end 2024, with Bitcoin down roughly 10% despite strong performance from gold, silver, and stocks, he sees this as potentially bullish. “ Anytime you start to see that sentiment, the pattern matching that I’ve seen in my years in the industry is that it could be the beginning of a signal that it’s about to rip, ” he said. The sentiment gap between retail and institutional investors has widened considerably. FINRA Foundation data shows crypto consideration among US investors dropped from 33% to 26% between 2021 and 2024, with 66% now viewing digital assets as extremely or very risky, up from 58%. US crypto purchase interest falls to 26% from 33% in 2021 as investor risk appetite declines sharply, FINRA study shows. #US #Crypto https://t.co/4mTMJ49hLC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 5, 2025 Meanwhile, institutional adoption has accelerated, with Morgan Stanley launching Bitcoin ETFs and traditional financial platforms expanding crypto access. Prince attributed this divergence to gradual distribution channel openings. “ A lot of those channels are still closed. They move slowly. The ETFs just came around last year. Some warehouses and other firms have a one-year lockdown on new ETFs being able to be made available to their clients, ” he explained. He expects institutional products to continue proliferating throughout 2025. Young Investors Drive Adoption Coinbase research found that 45% of younger US investors already own crypto, compared to just 18% of older generations, with younger cohorts allocating 25% of their portfolios to non-traditional assets (triple the 8% allocation among older investors). Four in five younger adults believe crypto will play a significantly larger role in future financial systems. South Korean data mirrors these trends, with over half of citizens aged 20-59 having crypto trading experience and 27% currently holding digital assets. Over 10,000 Koreans hold $750K+ in crypto, led by young investors, despite being the smallest group. #Korean #Crypto https://t.co/uA561EaY8O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 25, 2025 Current holders hold an average of 13 million won ($9,547) in cryptocurrency, representing 14% of their total financial assets. GalaxyOne is launching products targeting this demographic shift, including corporate treasury solutions, crypto portfolio lines of credit, and staking services. Prince revealed plans to combine crypto with traditional asset classes “ in a way that I don’t think other platforms have done before ” in the back half of 2025. Looking forward, Prince concluded that “ stablecoin adoption continues to increase rapidly ” and that it might facilitate the largest wealth transfer in history, intersecting with a generation already committed to digital assets.

If this price action continues for the current down leg, a big push up to $100,000 could be the next move. Potential bull flag formation Source: TradingView The $BTC price reached the top of its trajectory for the last upside push late on Monday. Since then, the price looks to have gone into a consolidation pattern that is starting to resemble a bull flag. There are only two touches to top and bottom of the flag so far, so this pattern is perhaps not far enough advanced in its formation to rely on just yet. Nevertheless, it does look promising up to now. Depending on how the pattern forms, the measured move from this potential bull flag could take the price up to around $98,000. If and when the price comes further down, a retest of the $90,400 horizontal support could coincide with a retest of the bottom of the flag, leading to a bounce. At the bottom of the chart, the 4-hour Stochastic RSI indicators are coming down nicely, followed by the 8-hour. If the 12-hour indicators can also drop a decent amount, a reasonable reset of these short-term indicators would have been accomplished, resulting in a stronger price momentum signal for the next upside leg. Bear flag or ascending triangle? Source: TradingView The daily time frame reveals that there are some important patterns and indicators in play. Starting from the bearish perspective, the bear flag is still forming. Until the price can confirm above this pattern, nullifying it, this is still a source of concern for the bulls. The daily Stochastic RSI indicators have only just started to come down from the top, so unless they start bouncing there, this particular momentum signal is likely to remain on pause. From the bullish point of view, the small bull flag has already been mentioned, although the measured move out of it would see the $BTC price staying within the confines of the much larger bear flag. The main bullish pattern here is the ascending triangle (in green). Tuesday’s surge to almost exactly test its upper trendline, probably served to confirm the pattern. The price could either break out on the next upside leg, or there could be a bit more chopping around to come before a breakout further along the triangle. The green dotted arrow illustrates the target of the breakout, which is at over $108,000. The Relative Strength Index, at the bottom of the chart, shows that the indicator line is bouncing from an ascending trendline. It will need to stay above this trendline if the bullish price action is to continue. Much riding on Stochastic RSI indicators Source: TradingView The weekly time frame view of the $BTC price shows that the bulls still have a lot to do. We are still less than halfway through the week, and with the next upside push to come, perhaps beginning on Thursday or Friday, a breakout could be witnessed before the weekly close on Sunday. What is absolutely crucial for the bulls is that the Stochastic RSI indicators do not come back down again. If both indicator lines are above the 20.00 level going into Monday, some big upside price momentum could be signalled. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Price action shows stability after a dip to $92,446, where buyers defended the area near the 21-day moving average around $91,800. (Source: CoinCodex ) Traders continue to focus on whether this structure can support a move toward the closely watched $100,000 level. Can Bitcoin maintain momentum as macro data approaches? Rejection at $94K Shapes the Short-Term Outlook Recent trading activity shows a clear rejection near the $94,000 resistance zone . Volume data points to active buyers defending lower levels, even as sellers capped upside attempts. Futures markets still show a short bias, yet neutral funding rates reduce the risk of sharp downside pressure. This balance keeps Bitcoin trading within a defined range rather than triggering a steep sell-off. Market participants now monitor daily closes for confirmation signals. Source: X Analysts highlight $94,278 as a critical level. A daily close above that price would strengthen the case for renewed upside momentum. In contrast, a move below $93,000 could open the door for a retest near $88,000. These thresholds frame current expectations and guide short-term positioning across spot and derivatives markets. Weekly Structure Signals a Potential Shift An analyst known for accurately calling the 2020 bull run noted that Bitcoin has protected the bottom of its weekly range. Price has since rallied across that range and now challenges the upper resistance area. This behavior mirrors previous breakout structures observed during earlier cycles. According to the analysis, a weekly close above the range high or a successful retest that turns resistance into support would confirm a breakout. Source: X Such a move would also end a weekly downtrend that started in mid-October 2025. While analysts describe that trend as mid-term in importance, they still view its resolution as meaningful for broader market direction. The same analysis stresses that the $93,500 area must hold as support to maintain a bullish mid-term bias. Liquidity Grab and the $93K Revisit Toward the end of 2025, the same analyst tracked Bitcoin grabbing liquidity around historical demand zones from early March and late April. Price later achieved a weekly close above that area, which set the stage for a revisit at the current market levels. Current price action respects that level, reinforcing its relevance within the broader structure. This behavior aligns with technical expectations rather than signaling exhaustion. On-Chain Demand Remains the Missing Piece Despite price stability above $93,000, on-chain data shows weak demand. Analysts note that a stronger recovery in on-chain activity must emerge to support a sustained return toward $100,000. Trading volumes remain subdued, and sentiment across the market stays mixed. These conditions limit conviction behind upside moves. Source: CryptoQuant However, analysts point to the end of the holiday period as a potential catalyst. As investors return to regular trading activity, on-chain movement could increase. That shift may provide the demand needed to support higher price levels.

However, since the turn of the year, fresh capital has begun re-entering the market after year end de-risking and tax-related selling fade. Coupled with renewed institutional demand for new crypto Spot ETFs, existing ETF inflows picking up and certain on-chain indicators flipping positive, this points to a crypto market that is beginning to show structural strength. Holiday Liquidity Removed Bitcoin and Ethereum finished the last quarter of 2025 with a negative 23.07% and 28.28% respectively. These were the most severe drawdowns seen since 2019. The rest of the altcoin market, calculated by the Total 2 excluding stablecoins chart (TOTAL2ES), saw a steeper drop of close to 40%. While arguably there were crypto specific factors that caused this decline such as selling pressure from long term holders, large Spot ETF outflows, deleveraging events throughout much of Q4. These moves were amplified by broader market forces. This includes thin year-end liquidity, as desks de-risked, books were closed and fewer participants were active, which allowed relatively modest flows to have a substantial impact on price. As January trading begins, liquidity gradually normalizes and positioning resets, which is why markets often feel more intentional and driven less by forced selling and more by forward looking conviction. Positioning Being Reset Towards the end of 2025, a narrative known as the “Bitcoin IPO moment” was gathering steem. This was a metaphor calling this a structural transition that allowed early and large holders to finally realize gains. The data shows us that there was a big cohort of long term Bitcoin whales that did sell throughout the second half of last year. However this position is being reset as this group has begun accumulating again after heavy selling pressure since the 4th of July last year. This is usually an indicator of a bottom formation. Sentiment Indicators Cooling Since January 1st, around $249.7 Billion have been added to the total cryptocurrency marketcap. During this period, Bitcoin is up around 6% while altcoins have delivered stronger relative performance. From a sentiment point of view, this rally has led the crypto fear and greed index to jump to 42, marking its highest level since October 2025. While sentiment is shifting positive, the YTD rally is being propped up by several factors including the positive on-chain point discussed above. Firstly, we’re seeing a renewal in Spot ETF flows. On January 5th, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw $697 million in net inflows. This was the largest single day inflow seen since early October. Secondly, clarity around the crypto market structure bill in the U.S. is gaining traction again with the Senate Banking Committee scheduled to mark up the bill on January 15th.

Bitcoin is now entering a critical support and resistance range of $93K – $95K. This zone has acted as a long term level and the immediate price to reclaim is the $93K mark with a daily close. If this range can be tested and held, the next hurdle is the $100K psychological level. Followed by this, there is a key technical level in the 50 week simple moving average which has historically acted as a bull market band. This level currently sits at $101.5K. Until these key zones are decisively regained, price action can potentially remain range-bound and reactive, with traders watching closely for confirmation rather than chasing momentum.",Press Release,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Over the past week, it has gained 4%. The focus now is shifting from short-term price swings to what’s happening with supply on exchanges. Fewer coins are being held on trading platforms, even as the price stays near $92,000. Exchange Supply Hits Lowest Levels Since 2018 The share of Bitcoin held on exchanges has dropped to around 13.7%, the lowest since 2018. Binance holds only 3.2% of the total supply, based on recent on-chain data. According to CryptosRus, this is part of a multi-year trend, not a temporary shift. Fewer inflows suggest holders are not preparing to sell. The asset has climbed steadily without signs of large deposits to exchanges. This behavior contrasts with past cycles, where increases in exchange inflows often led to corrections. So far, that isn’t showing up now. Supporting this, netflow charts show consistent outflows in recent weeks. On several days, especially December 22 and January 5, large amounts of BTC moved off exchanges. These outflows suggest buyers are moving coins into cold storage or long-term wallets. Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Netflow 7.1. Source: CryptoQuant Even as Bitcoin pushed near $95,000 and later pulled back, exchange inflows remained low. The lack of BTC being deposited to exchanges supports the view that fewer holders are looking to sell, even with the price near local highs. Adding another layer to the current picture, there’s some debate around long-term holder supply data. Analyst CW flagged an issue tied to Coinbase wallet migration in November. They said, “ The Coinbase wallet migration… is counted as a decrease in LTH supply, ” but that data may not reflect actual movement by long-term holders. CW added that “ over 500k $BTC ” should be included in long-term supply figures. If accurate, it means current estimates understate how much BTC is being held off exchanges. Price Choppy Around $93K as Traders Watch Levels Bitcoin has shown more volatility this week. After hitting nearly $95,000, it dropped below $91,500 before bouncing back near $93,000. Traders are watching price levels. Lennaert Snyder said , “ $BTC is trying to choose a direction here ,” and pointed to $93,800 and $96,500 as key levels to watch. He also mentioned a potential downside if the market fails to hold $91,200. Elsewhere, Michaël van de Poppe noted that price is holding above the 21-day moving average. He said the market is still in a range but could continue higher if that level holds. The $100,000 mark remains in focus if momentum builds and supply stays tight.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Wealth Isn’t About Hype—It’s About Time And Stacking, Expert Says According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, more than $1.2 billion flowed into those funds during the first two trading days of the year. He estimated that if that pace held, annualized inflows could reach about $150 billion — roughly 600% higher than the total for 2025. The spot Bitcoin ETFs are “coming into 2026 like a lion,” Balchunas said. ETF Flows Surge Early According to reports, nearly every major spot Bitcoin ETF saw money coming in during those opening sessions. Balchunas calls this inflow as broad-based. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) was one of the few exceptions that did not register the same demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was reported to have taken a large share of last year’s buying. The spot bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion, +$1.2 in flows in first two days of year w/ everyone eating. That’s a $150b/yr pace. Told ya’ll if they can take in $22b when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining. pic.twitter.com/YdRaLN0Op7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 6, 2026 Traditional Measures Fell Short Last Year Last year, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of over $21 billion. That was down from $35 billion in 2024. Yet Monday’s single-day net inflow of $697 million was the biggest daily intake in three months, and it came as Bitcoin traded back above the low $90,000s. Trading volume rose and some positions that had bet on a price drop were closed, which added to the move. Institutional Moves And New Filings Reports show Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC to offer both Bitcoin and Solana ETFs, a step that puts a major wealth manager alongside established issuers. Balchunas pointed out Morgan Stanley manages about $8 trillion in advisory assets and has already cleared its advisors to allocate to such products. The firm’s proposed Bitcoin trust, according to the filing, would track the spot price and avoid leverage or derivatives. How The Flows Affect The Market Analysts say ETF demand is likely to soak up circulating Bitcoin supply. If sustained, that dynamic could change how much liquidity is available to traders and might reduce the amount of BTC offered on exchanges. There was an early sign of unevenness: preliminary figures showed a large outflow from one Fidelity fund on Tuesday, which raised the chance of a net outflow for the day once all data were in.

The top crypto asset kept its composure around the low $90,000s and climbed past $93,000 at moments. Traders and analysts pointed to short position liquidations and a rebound in other risk assets as reasons for the lift. Some on-chain observers flagged accumulation by larger holders, while others said markets were treating the news as concluded rather than as a fresh shock.

56931385,654512,1767783611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56931385.jpeg,"Bitcoin Investor Behavior Diverges: Whales Buying, Retail Selling",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-diverges-whales-buying-retail-selling/,bitcoinist,"On-chain data shows the large Bitcoin investors have been accumulating recently, while retail investors have been exiting from the market. Bitcoin Investors Have Been Diverging In Behavior In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest behavior in the Bitcoin supply of the retail investors and that of the sharks and whales . Retail investors here refer to the smallest of entities on the network, carrying less than 0.01 BTC ($923) in their wallets. The sharks and whales, on the other hand, are groups that correspond to the investors with notable holdings. The range for these large investors is defined as 10 to 10,000 coins, which converts to $923,000 at the lower end and $923 million at the upper one. Because of their massive holdings, the sharks and whales are considered to carry some influence in the market. Naturally, the whales, which include the much more massive investors of the two, are regarded as the more important group. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the two sides of the network over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have been in a phase of accumulation since December 17th. During this window, they have added a total of 56,227 BTC ($5.2 billion) to their holdings. “This marked crypto’s local bottom,” noted the analytics firm. In the same period, the retail side of the market has also participated in net buying. BTC initially consolidated while this accumulation occurred, but in the last few days, its price has witnessed some recovery . Interestingly, the investor cohorts have diverged since this breakout, with retail traders turning to distribution while the sharks and whales have continued to add. This is a potential sign that the small hands believe the new rally to be a bull’s trap, so they are exiting with their profits while they can. Santiment considers this setup to be a bullish one. According to the analytics firm, selling from sharks and whales that coincides with retail buying tends to be “very bearish,” while both buying at the same time (or retail being sideways) is “bullish,” and whales accumulating/retail selling is a “very bullish” combination. In the chart, the last of these zones is highlighted in green. “Entering into a green zone now, we have a higher probability than usual to continue to see market cap growth throughout crypto,” explained Santiment. It now remains to be seen whether the divergence in the Bitcoin market will continue to grow or if the sharks and whales will flip and start harvesting profits. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $92,600, up over 5% in the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin divergence|Bitcoin Retail|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

While funds like Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC led the outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract capital, even as Bitcoin consolidated near $92,000. Elsewhere in the Bitcoin ecosystem, miner and hardware maker Canaan launched a Canadian pilot project that repurposes waste heat from Bitcoin mining to support greenhouse agriculture, reflecting the industry’s growing focus on efficiency, renewable energy, and cost reduction as mining difficulty reaches record highs. Bitcoin ETF Flows Turn Negative US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) swung back to net outflows on Tuesday, ending a strong start to 2026 that saw more than $1.16 billion flow into the products over the first two trading days of the year. Data from Farside Investors shows that Bitcoin ETFs recorded $243 million in net outflows on the day, the first negative session for aggregate flows in 2026. The pullback was largely driven by Fidelity’s FBTC, which saw $312.24 million leave the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC posted $83.07 million in outflows, while its Bitcoin Mini Trust recorded an additional $32.73 million in redemptions. Products from Ark & 21Shares and VanEck also reported net outflows. Bitcoin ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) These exits were partially offset by strength in BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted $228.66 million in net inflows on Tuesday and stood out as the only spot Bitcoin ETF to post positive flows that day. Over the first three trading days of 2026, IBIT has accumulated roughly $888 million in net inflows. People were quick to downplay concerns that the outflows signal a shift in sentiment. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the moves look more like post-inflow normalization rather than a broader risk-off event, and argued that institutions are rebalancing exposure rather than abandoning their Bitcoin convictions. He added that Bitcoin’s price resilience supports this view, as the asset appears to be consolidating rather than capitulating. BTC’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex ) At press time, Bitcoin was trading close to $92,334, down about 1.25% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinCodex . Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, described the outflows as a modest and healthy pullback driven by profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing after strong inflows. While Bitcoin ETFs cooled, capital appeared to rotate elsewhere in the market. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $114.7 million in net inflows despite outflows from Grayscale and Fidelity products. XRP and Solana ETFs also saw net inflows of $19 million and $9 million, respectively. Canaan Recycles Bitcoin Mining Heat In other Bitcoin-related news, Bitcoin mining hardware maker and miner Canaan is continuing its push to repurpose energy from computing infrastructure by launching a heat recovery pilot to support greenhouse agriculture in Canada. In a notice that was released on Tuesday, the company said it will participate in a 3-megawatt proof-of-concept with Bitforest Investment in Manitoba, where waste heat from Bitcoin mining equipment will be reused to supplement greenhouse operations. Announcement from Canaan The project will run for an initial 24 months and will use Canaan’s liquid-cooled Avalon computing systems to capture heat generated by mining servers. That heat will then be used to preheat water intake for Bitforest’s greenhouses, lowering overall energy requirements and reducing reliance on fossil-fuel boilers. According to Bitforest , its Manitoba operations currently focus on tomato production, making consistent heat supply particularly important in colder climates. Canaan chair and CEO Nangeng Zhang said the pilot is designed to be more than a one-off deployment, and described it as a data-driven and replicable model for integrating computing infrastructure with energy-intensive industries. Zhang said the company plans to measure, model, and eventually scale heat recovery systems for agricultural use, while also advancing broader efforts to improve energy sustainability for households, businesses, and industrial partners. The project will deploy a computing system consisting of 360 liquid-cooled servers, with heat that would normally be vented instead recycled into productive use. The initiative forms part of a trend among Bitcoin miners seeking to reduce costs and improve efficiency as mining difficulty rises. Canaan itself launched a mining facility at a wind-powered site in Texas in September. Digital infrastructure firm Phoenix Group also announced a 30-MW hydroelectric-powered mining facility in Ethiopia, while Sangha Renewables launched a 20-MW solar-powered operation in Texas. Rising mining difficulty intensified the search for efficiency gains. After climbing sharply in 2025 and reaching record highs, difficulty is expected to surge again this month. Data from CoinWarz shows Bitcoin mining difficulty stood at roughly 148.2 trillion at press time, which is likely why miners are turning to renewable energy and waste-heat recovery solutions.",News|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This is not wrong but it would also be inaccurate to say that crypto is only an asset class for trading and holding for the long term. 2025 taught us that cryptocurrencies, via stablecoins, transitioned into a full fledged payment settlements rail. For everyday transactions, crypto is increasingly being used not just to invest, but to spend. The easiest method to off ramp crypto into a local currency and spend today is through crypto cards. These are debit cards that bridge crypto wallets, exchanges and traditional payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. These cards not only make it extremely easy and efficient to spend your crypto but oftentimes also reward users with cashback. Integrations with Visa and Mastercard enable seamless payment across millions of merchants worldwide. As spending volumes on crypto cards increase year on year, this is a trend worth watching closely in 2026. This article highlights some of the top crypto cards available on the market today. Each of these cards on the list are categorized based on the type of user it may be most relevant for. Binance Card – Best Overall Crypto Card Why it ranks #1 Binance, the largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has a crypto card service which acts as the easiest off ramp method for Binance users. Since the card is issued by Binance, the integration is extremely smooth within the Binance application and broader ecosystem, enabling easy funding, tracking and rewards management. The list of cryptocurrencies that can be automatically converted into local fiat currency at the point of sale varies depending on the region. That said, popular stablecoins like USDT and USDC and bluechip cryptos like BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL and XRP are available for withdrawal in all regions. There are no joining or annual fees attached to the crypto card and users have access to a virtual card immediately after applying. Key Features The Binance Card is a Visa-branded payment card which enables users to spend their crypto anywhere Visa is accepted. This includes both physical and online stores once their account is funded. Apart from being able to spend their crypto across millions of merchants worldwide, Binance also offers cashback rewards of up to 3% on every purchase. It must be noted, however, that these cashback rewards differ depending on the region. Best For The Binance Card is extremely useful for those who are active crypto users. For those who hold and trade crypto frequently, this service allows you to effectively off-ramp crypto automatically without having to exit positions and convert to a local fiat currency manually. The integration with the Binance application also brings a streamlined user experience. Existing Binance users will find this beneficial as all the information regarding portfolio, spends and rewards are displayed neatly in a single interface. Limitations The biggest hurdle that the Binance Card runs into is the regional support. Currently the service is only operational in Brazil, Columbia and Peru. Another trade-off is that by using the Binance Card, users must hold their assets within Binance. This means that assets are custodial, which may not suit those looking for complete control over their private keys. Crypto.com Visa Card – Best Rewards Program Why it stands out The Crypto.com Visa card is a prepaid crypto card popular for its tiered rewards system. It offers some of the highest cashback rates among crypto debit cards. Users, depending on the tier, can earn up to 8% in CRO ( Crypto.com ’s native token) on every transaction and up to 15% on travel spending. The tiered structure is based on the amount of CRO tokens staked or locked up on the platform. While there is a free subscription in the midnight blue crypto card, the everyday CRO rewards become applicable only with paid tiers or lock up models. The crypto cards can be easily topped up from your crypto holdings, from fiat in your cash account or with a credit/debit card within the crypto.com application. Currently, the exchange offers this service across North America (US & Canada), Europe (many EU countries & UK), Singapore, Australia and Brazil with plans of ongoing expansion to more regions. The attractive rewards for higher tiers unlocked through staking CRO tokens will appeal to long term CRO holders to maximize cashback and card benefits. Trade-offs To access some of the premium cards with the highest rewards, users are required to stake large amounts of CRO tokens, generally for 12 months. This ties up capital and exposes users to the price volatility attached to the CRO token. Coinbase Card – Best for Beginners Why it’s included Coinbase as a crypto exchange is known for its simplicity and user friendly interface. This design thinking extends to its crypto card service as well. For beginners looking to use crypto cards, coinbase offers a visa debit card that links directly to a users’ coinbase wallet. There is minimal setup and no staking requirements. Accessibility is a strong point for the Coinbase Card as it is available across key markets. It is currently available in the United States (all states except Hawaii) and many European countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and others. Limitations Although users can earn rewards on purchases, the rates are lower compared with tiered reward systems like Crypto.com ’s structure. Another drawback is that in many markets, a conversion spread applies every time crypto is sold to fund a purchase or ATM withdrawal, which essentially increases the cost of transactions relative to flat-fee cards. Wirex Card – Best for EU Users Why it works The Wirex platform is built as an everything app where users can grow, borrow and spend their crypto. The Wirex crypto debit card is widely available across Europe, including the UK and many EU member states. Users can earn instant rewards of up to 8% cashback on everyday spending. Apple pay and google pay integration also enables tap and pay functionality across merchants worldwide. One of its core strengths is its multi-currency account model. Users can hold, convert and spend a variety of both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies within one wallet. BitPay Card – Best Bitcoin First Card The BitPay card is a prepaid crypto debit card that makes it easy to spend Bitcoin, stablecoins like USDC, EURC, USDP etc and altcoins like ETH, BCH, DOGE and others. The BitPay card functions as a normal Visa/Mastercard debit card, allowing users to spend anywhere these networks are accepted. However, as of recent updates, new applications for the BitPay card have temporarily paused while the program is being improved. Nexo Card – Best Hybrid Credit-Style Crypto Card Why it’s different This list thus far has highlighted some of the top crypto debit cards. The Nexo Card, however, stands out because it offers both a credit and debit mode in one crypto payment card. In the credit mode, users can make everyday purchases using funds drawn from a crypto-backed credit line rather than having to sell their digital assets. The crypto you hold acts as collateral for the credit line, allowing you to spend fiat without selling your crypto. Therefore, the Nexo can function like a credit card but with your crypto value behind it. This gives users access to liquidity while keeping their longer term positions intact. While there is an in-built debit mode, the credit feature is inherently more complex. Users must understand how borrowing works, how collateral affects credit availability and how repayments and interest are factored in.

Venezuelan oil access could cap fuel costs, allowing continued monetary easing. Rising oil prices may disrupt Bitcoin gains by forcing tighter financial conditions. A recent market note by BitMEX cofounder Arthur Hayes has sparked debate across crypto markets after linking U.S. actions in Venezuela to Bitcoin’s next major move. The report frames the issue through politics, energy prices, and liquidity rather than ideology. Significantly, it argues that election pressure, not geopolitics, will guide U.S. economic policy. Hence, Bitcoin’s direction depends less on oil itself and more on how aggressively Washington expands credit. Hayes presents the situation as a simple political equation.

A surge in call option buying alongside a decisive reclaim of key moving averages has shifted short-term market structure, prompting renewed upside momentum. The below piece of analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto PR agency that skillfully blends data analysis and boutique-touch approach to enable web3 projects make the most of every moment. Call Options Signal Bullish Positioning Nearly 10,000 BTC call options for the January 30, 2026 expiry were purchased on Deribit , pointing to growing leveraged exposure to the upside. Such concentrated activity in longer-dated calls is typically associated with institutional or sophisticated traders positioning for continued strength rather than short-lived volatility. Options markets often act as a forward-looking indicator. The scale and direction of this flow suggest confidence in Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory, reinforcing the bullish bias seen in spot price action. BTC Reclaims 50-Day SMA On the technical side, Bitcoin has reclaimed its 50-day simple moving average near $89.5K. This level had previously acted as resistance, making the breakout technically significant. The move also produced a bullish EMA stack, with the 8-day EMA crossing above the 20-day, which in turn sits above the 50-day. This alignment signals improving trend strength and often attracts momentum-based and systematic strategies. Momentum indicators remain constructive. The Relative Strength Index is currently around 58, placing BTC firmly in bullish territory without signaling overbought conditions. This suggests there is room for continuation before momentum becomes stretched.

Strong call option demand points to institutional confidence, while the reclaim of the 50-day SMA and bullish EMA stack support the case for further upside. As long as BTC holds above key moving averages, momentum favors a continuation toward higher resistance levels. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The figure was highlighted by investigative journalist Bradley Hope in social media posts and an intelligence newsletter, sparking intense discussion in crypto and policy circles. Hope’s commentary described a scenario in which Venezuela’s government converted proceeds from looted gold sales into Bitcoin over years. He referenced a Swiss lawyer alleged to control access to the supposed reserve and tied the narrative to Maduro’s long-time associate Alex Saab. Despite the attention, analysts caution that the 600,000 BTC estimate is not backed by on-chain evidence or public wallet tracking. Mainstream blockchain intelligence firms have found no verifiable proof of such holdings, and public trackers list Venezuela’s known official Bitcoin at only about 240 BTC. The claim has moved beyond niche speculation. Major crypto news outlets and analysts are publishing updates, but most stress that at this point the figure remains an unverified estimate rather than documented government reserves. Post claims “shadow reserve” built from gold swaps and USDT oil settlement Meanwhile, a crypto market commentator using the handle Serenity claimed Venezuela built a $60 billion-plus “shadow reserve” in Bitcoin and Tether, arguing the stockpile grew through gold trades and oil payments structured to skirt sanctions. Estimated Bitcoin Holdings of Major Entities. Source: Serenity Serenity said the estimate relies on “intelligence” and human sources and cited Whale Hunting, which the post attributed to Bradley Hope and Clara Preve, as the basis for a timeline starting in 2018. The post linked that start date to Venezuela’s alleged liquidation of gold from the Orinoco Mining Arc. The post claimed Venezuela converted about $2 billion in gold proceeds into Bitcoin at an average price near $5,000, implying roughly 400,000 BTC from that tranche. Using a January 2026 Bitcoin price near $90,000, Serenity said that portion alone would be worth about $36 billion. Serenity also claimed Venezuela shifted from the failed Petro project toward using USDT during crude oil sales, then later converted stablecoins into Bitcoin to avoid the risk of address freezes. The post estimated the alleged holdings by category: Gold swaps (2018–2020) at $45 billion to $50 billion, petro crypto oil activity (2023–2025) at $10 billion to $15 billion, and mining seizures (2023–2024) near $500 million, for a total of $56 billion to $67 billion. The commentator said a seizure narrative would not automatically mean U.S. control because access would depend on private keys or seed phrases. Serenity argued the situation could lead to litigation or custody arrangements that prevent movement of coins, and it framed other outcomes, including long term holding by U.S. authorities or rapid liquidation, as potential paths. Serenity’s post also ranked the alleged Venezuelan total against other large holders, listing Satoshi Nakamoto at about 1.1 million BTC, BlackRock’s IBIT at about 770,791.5 BTC, Microstrategy (MSTR) at about 672,497 BTC, Venezuela (seized) at about 600,000 BTC, the U.S. government at about 325,293 BTC, and the Mt. Gox trustee at about 140,000 BTC. Market Reaction and Bitcoin Price Context Crypto markets have reacted modestly to the rumors amid broader geopolitical developments. Bitcoin traded near $91,000–$93,000 in the days following the news, showing both upward spikes and pulls as traders absorbed conflicting narratives. According to price data for the first week of January, BTC climbed from below $88,000 at the start of the year to highs above $93,000 before settling near $91,600. Bitcoin BTC Price Moves Early January 2026. Source: CoinCodex This price behavior occurred against a backdrop of increased speculative trading tied to the Maduro story. Some commentators connected the price action to concerns that the alleged Venezuelan holdings, if ever moved or seized, could materially affect supply dynamics in the Bitcoin market. However, analysts also emphasize that market fundamentals and macro factors — including institutional inflows, ETF flows, and broader risk sentiment — are likely stronger drivers of price than the uncertain reserve claims. Given the lack of transparent on-chain linkage, many traders treat the alleged stash as rumor rather than a verified catalyst. If Venezuela does control significant undisclosed Bitcoin, tracing those assets would require access to private keys or cooperation from insiders. Until such evidence emerges, the story remains a debate about possibility, not proof.",News|Legal,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This pivotal move represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency integration within traditional finance. Consequently, the announcement immediately triggered significant market reactions and regulatory discussions. Industry analysts now predict accelerated institutional adoption of digital assets throughout 2025. Morgan Stanley Ethereum ETF Filing Details and Immediate Context Morgan Stanley submitted its spot Ethereum ETF application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. The filing specifically seeks approval to create a fund that directly holds Ethereum (ETH). This structure differs from futures-based ETFs, which track derivative contracts. Therefore, a spot ETF provides investors with direct exposure to the underlying asset’s price movements. Major financial institutions typically pursue such products to meet growing client demand for regulated crypto access. Reuters initially broke the news, which aggrNews subsequently verified and reported. Morgan Stanley manages approximately $1.5 trillion in client assets globally. The firm previously allowed wealthy clients to access Bitcoin funds through its brokerage platform in 2021. This Ethereum filing logically extends that strategy into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Regulatory approval processes generally take several months, involving detailed reviews and public comment periods. Institutional Crypto Investment Landscape in 2025 The cryptocurrency investment landscape has evolved dramatically since the first Bitcoin ETF approvals. Institutional participation now represents a substantial portion of daily trading volume across major exchanges. Several key factors currently drive this trend. First, clearer regulatory frameworks in multiple jurisdictions provide necessary legal certainty. Second, advanced custody solutions from firms like Coinbase and Fidelity mitigate security concerns. Third, demonstrated portfolio diversification benefits attract traditional asset managers. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 fundamentally altered its investment thesis. The network now consumes approximately 99.95% less energy than its previous proof-of-work model. This environmental improvement addresses a major institutional concern regarding sustainable investing. Additionally, Ethereum’s robust developer ecosystem continues to launch innovative decentralized applications. These range from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum ETF Approvals The SEC approved the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 after a decade-long regulatory battle. These products have accumulated billions in assets under management within their first year. The approval process established important precedents for surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets. Ethereum ETFs now benefit from this established regulatory pathway. However, the SEC must still determine whether Ethereum qualifies as a commodity or security under U.S. law. Key Differences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Considerations Factor Bitcoin ETF Ethereum ETF Primary Use Case Digital Gold / Store of Value Programmable Blockchain / Smart Contracts Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (Energy Intensive) Proof-of-Stake (Energy Efficient) Regulatory Classification Generally Accepted as Commodity Ongoing SEC Determination First U.S. Approval January 2024 Pending (Multiple Applications) Institutional Demand Driver Inflation Hedge Web3 Ecosystem Participation Potential Market Impacts and Expert Perspectives Financial analysts immediately began assessing the potential market impacts of Morgan Stanley’s Ethereum ETF filing. Approval could unlock substantial institutional capital currently awaiting regulated access points. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that spot Ethereum ETFs might attract $10-15 billion in net inflows during their first year. This capital influx would likely increase Ethereum’s liquidity and reduce price volatility over time. Furthermore, mainstream adoption typically follows institutional validation of asset classes. Several industry experts provided context regarding this development. “Morgan Stanley’s filing represents a logical progression in the maturation of crypto markets,” stated Sarah Johnson, Director of Digital Assets Research at FinTech Analytics. “Institutions now recognize Ethereum’s dual role as both a digital asset and a technology platform.” Johnson emphasized that Ethereum’s annual inflation rate currently sits below 0.5% post-merge. This scarcity characteristic appeals to traditional investors familiar with commodity investments. Regulatory experts note that the SEC faces mounting pressure to establish consistent digital asset policies. Multiple spot Ethereum ETF applications now await review from various asset managers. These include proposals from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale Investments. The commission must evaluate each application based on investor protection standards and market integrity concerns. Most analysts predict decisions will likely cluster around mid-2025, following established procedural timelines. Global Regulatory Environment for Cryptocurrency ETFs International markets provide relevant precedents for U.S. regulators considering Ethereum ETF applications. Canada approved both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in 2021, which now trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. European markets offer various crypto exchange-traded products through regulated exchanges in Germany and Switzerland. These international products have operated without major security incidents or market disruptions. Their trading data provides empirical evidence regarding investor demand and market structure requirements. Hong Kong recently launched spot crypto ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum in April 2024. These Asian products attracted significant capital from regional institutional investors. Their successful launch demonstrates viable operational models for fund administrators and custodians. U.S. regulators typically consider international regulatory approaches when developing domestic frameworks. This global context supports arguments for approving similar products in American markets. Technical and Operational Considerations for Ethereum ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs present unique technical challenges compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. Fund administrators must develop secure processes for staking the underlying ETH holdings. Staking allows Ethereum validators to earn rewards for securing the network, potentially generating additional yield for ETF shareholders. However, staking introduces liquidity considerations and smart contract risks that require careful management. Several applicants have proposed solutions that balance yield generation with liquidity requirements. Custody solutions represent another critical operational component. Qualified custodians must store private keys controlling billions in digital assets with bank-level security. These firms employ multi-signature wallets, geographic distribution of key shards, and insurance coverage against theft or loss. Major financial institutions typically require these safeguards before allocating client capital to crypto products. Fortunately, institutional-grade custody services have matured significantly since 2020. Staking Integration: Potential yield enhancement through network participation Custody Solutions: Institutional-grade security from specialized providers Market Surveillance: Data-sharing agreements with regulated trading venues Tax Treatment: Clear reporting requirements for capital gains and income Liquidity Provision: Authorized participants creating and redeeming shares Historical Context: Morgan Stanley’s Crypto Strategy Evolution Morgan Stanley has systematically increased its cryptocurrency exposure since first exploring digital assets in 2018. The firm initially conducted internal research on blockchain technology’s potential applications. In March 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first major U.S. bank to offer Bitcoin access to wealthy clients. This offering required minimum investments of $2 million through externally managed funds. Client response exceeded expectations, prompting expanded digital asset services throughout 2022 and 2023. The bank’s investment research division began publishing formal crypto market analysis in 2022. These reports helped educate traditional investors about blockchain fundamentals and valuation methodologies. Morgan Stanley also participated in several blockchain infrastructure funding rounds. These strategic investments provide insight into emerging technologies while generating potential financial returns. The Ethereum ETF filing represents the latest step in this multi-year digital asset integration strategy. Conclusion Morgan Stanley’s spot Ethereum ETF filing marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream financial acceptance. This development signals growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and regulatory clarity. The application process will likely unfold throughout 2025, with potential approvals creating new investment pathways for traditional portfolios. Market participants should monitor SEC communications and technical developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately, regulated access products like the Morgan Stanley Ethereum ETF could accelerate blockchain technology adoption across global financial systems. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Ethereum ETF? A spot Ethereum ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Ethereum tokens, allowing investors to gain price exposure without directly purchasing or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: How does Morgan Stanley’s filing differ from previous crypto ETF applications? Morgan Stanley’s filing represents a major traditional financial institution seeking direct Ethereum exposure, unlike earlier applications from specialized crypto firms, potentially signaling broader institutional acceptance. Q3: When might the SEC decide on Ethereum ETF applications? Most analysts predict SEC decisions on multiple pending Ethereum ETF applications will likely occur in mid-to-late 2025, following established regulatory review timelines and potential political considerations. Q4: What are the main regulatory hurdles for Ethereum ETF approval? The SEC must determine whether Ethereum qualifies as a commodity or security under U.S. law and establish adequate market surveillance mechanisms to prevent fraud and manipulation. Q5: How might Ethereum ETF approval affect retail investors? Approval would provide retail investors with regulated, accessible exposure to Ethereum through traditional brokerage accounts, potentially with lower barriers to entry than direct cryptocurrency purchases.

The largest gains can be experienced in projects which are still relatively early and undervalued. Currently at the front of the pack is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is enjoying swift adoption during the presale phase. Currently at $0.04 during Phase 7, the MUTM presale provides the best returns to those who buy early, with the token price set to go higher soon. Already surpassing $19.5 million and growing with a wider holder base, it is a serious DeFi crypto providing lending and borrowing solutions and represents an extremely promising cryptocurrency ahead of the next market expansion. For investors looking for the best crypto to buy, Mutuum Finance presents a front-row opportunity with returns which outperform other DeFi players. Analysts also suggest that MUTM could be the next crypto to explode, making it a top consideration for forward-looking investors. How BTC Stability Makes MUTM More Attractive Bitcoin is still displaying a strong pattern as it maintains strength above the $90,000 support level and follows through on efforts to reach the resistance level of $95,000. Momentum suggests that there is still measured movement upward in price despite showing short-term selling pressures. As one of the leading assets in the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin is still not as attractive as new projects such as MUTM for investors seeking bigger gains for their investments. Still being in the presale stage makes it accessible for investors long before trading starts. This early-stage advantage positions MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy for those looking to enter before the mainstream crowd. Ground-Level Opportunity Mutuum Finance is still in its early stages of development, which means early investors have a huge edge. Based on the current presale cost of $0.04, an investment of $2,500 would fetch 62,500 MUTM tokens. Assuming MUTM hits $1 in a year, which is also discussed among analysts, that $2,500 could turn into $62,500, which would provide potential profits exceeding $60,000. Even the most conservative estimates would provide substantial profits; for example, at a price of $0.10 after its presale, that same $2,500 would now be worth $6,250, which is more than double the initial investment. With such a strong potential for growth, many investors see MUTM as the next crypto to explode in value. The presale has already surpassed 18,710 unique token holders as phase 7 sees strong investor FOMO. Phase 8 will start soon at a higher price. Mutuum Finance does not only provide tokens but incentivizes community engagement to encourage natural demand for MUTM. A reward of $100,000 will give ten people $10,000 in MUTM, and a daily leaderboard reward gives the top buyer $500 on a daily basis. This helps recognize project demand through proper incentives, further cementing its reputation as the best crypto to buy and the next crypto to explode for early investors. Transparent, Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance has an open-source approach, meaning anyone in the public could view and verify the code to be used in the project. This provides a tremendous boost to the trust factor. It also shows the investors that the project is not a temporary experiment in the DeFi sector but will be a long-term DeFi infrastructure project, making it a prime candidate for the best crypto to buy and a strong contender for the next crypto to explode. Instant Access to Liquidity Provides Greater Opportunities One of the edges provided by MUTM lies in the constant liquidity that users get to enjoy, allowing them to borrow or invest funds instantly and irrespective of market conditions. Take, for instance, an investor who holds $1,000 in ETH but realizes the need for immediate cash flow for a short period. The investor can borrow USDT through their ETH without selling the latter. Conversely, for example, a user in possession of 3 ETH can choose to lend it out on the platform and get an 8–10% APY in return, earning him or her an extra 0.24–0.3 ETH in passive income without selling his or her holdings. Mutuum Finance offers ground-floor pricing, real-world utility, and a powerful incentive structure that makes it a very attractive investment option. Early adopters will benefit from token value appreciation, as well as through actual participation in a functional ecosystem that pays users for growth. With possible upside that would take a $2,500 investment to $62,500, depending on the scenario, MUTM offers a very special investment opportunity. With all these factors combined, it’s increasingly clear why many consider MUTM the best crypto to buy.

Currently, 65 of the top 100 coins have dropped over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume stands at $150 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap is down 1.6% (Wednesday morning, UTC); 65 of the top 100 coins and 9 of the top 10 coins dropped today; BTC decreased by 1.9% to $91,799, and ETH is down by 0.5% to $3,211; The US Fed remarks are dovish; The Fed Governor Stephen Miran said the current interest rate policy is ‘clearly restrictive’; Crypto market focuses on whether liquidity expectations undergo a substantive turning point; US DOJ liquidated 57 BTC forfeited by Samourai Wallet developers; MSCI is looking into excluding digital asset treasury companies from its equity indexes; US BTC spot ETFs posted outflows of $243.24 million, while ETH spot ETFs saw $114.74 million in inflows; Renewed ETF demand is steadily absorbing circulating supply; Crypto market sentiment pauses within the neutral zone. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, 9 of the top 10 coins per market capitalisation have seen their prices go down over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is down by 1.9% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $91,799. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) fell by 0.5%, now changing hands at $3,211. The category’s biggest drop at the time of writing is 4.7% by XRP , currently standing at $2.25. It’s followed by BTC’s 1.9%, and then Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 1.6% to the price of $0.1483. Tron (TRX) often goes against the flow, and it does so today as well. It is the only green coin, having appreciated 1.1% and trading at $0.2944. Among the top 100 coins, 65 recorded drops. Provenance Blockchain (HASH) is the only one with a double-digit red percentage. It’s down by 10.3% to $0.02686. Mantle (MNT) is next, with a drop of 5.9%, changing hands at $1.05. As for the green coins, Hyperliquid (HYPE) and MemeCore (M) are up 3.4% and 3.2% to $27.42 and $1.68, respectively. The rest on this short list appreciated 1.1% and less per coin. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has liquidated 57 BTC forfeited by Samourai Wallet developers through Coinbase Prime on 3 November 2025. Senator Cynthia Lummis has criticised this move, saying the United States “can’t afford to squander these strategic assets while other nations are accumulating bitcoin. I’m deeply concerned about this report,” she added. ‘Dovish US Fed Remarks’ On Tuesday, the US Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said that the current interest rate policy is “clearly restrictive.” There is justification for rate cuts “well in excess of 100 basis points” in 2026, he added. According to Bitunix analysts, “the remarks are distinctly dovish and stand in sharp contrast to views held by some officials who believe policy is already near neutral, underscoring widening internal divergence within the Federal Reserve over the economic outlook and the appropriate policy stance.” They argue that, “The issue at hand is not a single official’s remarks, but the convergence of policy divergence with pivotal data releases. The direction of employment data will determine whether markets move toward a ‘rate pause’ narrative or begin to front-run deeper and earlier easing. For the crypto market, the core focus remains whether liquidity expectations undergo a substantive turning point.” Meanwhile, Fabian Dori, CIO at Sygnum , commented on the recent renewed ETF demand, arguing that it is “increasingly relevant for market structure.” ETF demand is steadily absorbing circulating supply, Dori says. This suggests a potential long-term demand shock, rather than short-term speculative flows. Moreover, recent regulatory developments “are reinforcing structurally higher participation from institutional allocators rather than tactical inflows.” These include lower barriers to launching crypto ETFs. Per Dori, this shift is part of the broader “debasement trade,” with institutions increasingly reallocating into scarce, non-dilutive assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, major US banks, including Bank of America and Morgan Stanley , expand access to spot Bitcoin ETFs amid rising sovereign debt and persistent inflation uncertainty, an email says. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC stood at $91,799. It’s been quite a choppy trading day for the coin. It initially plunged from the intraday high of $94,343 to the low of $91,544. It recovered to the $93,600 level before falling nearly to the intraday low again. Should the coin hold the $91,000 level, it may soon see another leg up towards $94,000 and $96,000. But if BTC falls below $90,000, it could be dragged back to the $85,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,211. It too saw several larger recoveries and falls over the past 24 hours. It climbed several times towards the intraday high of $3,300 before falling towards the intraday low of $3,196. ETH could be on the way to the sub-$3,100 levels, followed by a pullback towards $2,900. Yet, if it holds, it may continue the recent push upwards towards $3,600 and $3,800. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has stayed unmoved for the past two days, still holding firm in neutral territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 49 today , the same as yesterday. Some optimism remains, but caution is rising. Notably, the metric has been out of the fear zone for just a week now, since the beginning of this year, so it will be interesting to see in which direction it will move following this latest pause. BTC ETFs Go Red, ETH ETFs Hold Green Streak After a couple of days of increases, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded negative flows. On Tuesday, these let go of $243.24 million in total. With this, the total net inflow pulled back to $57.54 billion. One of the twelve BTC ETFs saw inflows, and five saw outflows. BlackRock posted the only inflow amount of $228.66 million. The highest outflow is Fidelity’s $312.24 million, followed by Grayscale’s $115.8 million. However, the US ETH ETFs posted another day of positive flows on 6 January, for a third day in a row, with $114.74 million . The total net inflow increased slightly to $12.79 billion. Of the nine funds, three recorded inflows, and three posted outflows. BlackRock took in $198.8 million in inflows. It’s followed by 21Shares and Bitwise with $1.62 million and $1.39 million, respectively. On the other side, Grayscale let go of $85.45 million in total on Tuesday, followed by Fidelity’s $1.62 million. Meanwhile, index provider MSCI plans to exclude the so-called digital asset treasury companies from its equity indexes. “Distinguishing between investment companies and other companies that hold non-operating assets, such as digital assets, as part of their core operations rather than for investment purposes requires further research and consultation with market participants,” MSCI said. MSCI confirmed Digital Asset Treasury Companies will remain in MSCI Indexes for the Feb 2026 review. A strong outcome for neutral indexing and economic reality.

Arkham Intelligence reported that three wallets accumulated 3,000 BTC worth approximately $280 million in the last 10 hours. The analytics firm believes that the three wallets might belong to the same whale. The purchase of BTC by whales and institutions also suggests a bullish trend and confidence in Bitcoin as prices recover to the $100,000 level. Bitcoin’s break above $90K causes an increase in whale activity 📊 Crypto markets typically follow the path of key whale & shark stakeholders, and move the opposite direction of small retail wallets. In our chart below: 🟥 Whales dumping, Retail accumulating (VERY BEARISH) 🟧 Whales dumping, Retail unpredictable (BEARISH) 🟨 Whales & Retail… pic.twitter.com/yoC0H1keBT — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 5, 2026 At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $91,855, down nearly 7% in the last 24 hours. BTC bounced back at the beginning of the year, up about 3.9% in the last 7 days. Santiment stated that Bitcoin’s break above $90,000 has led to an increase in whale activity, signaling a shift in market participation. Santiment also reported that large Bitcoin holders have been buying since mid-December. The analytics firm found that large holders added more than 56,227 BTC, worth approximately $5.3 billion, since December 17. Santiment acknowledged that there has been a shift in market positioning, as BTC whales now control more Bitcoin than they did in mid-December. The on-chain analytics firm argued that crypto markets have historically moved in the direction chosen by whales, rather than following retail behavior. Santiment noted that Bitcoin whales initiated the accumulation phase at the asset’s bottom in mid-December. The firm also found that whale wallets increased their positions even as prices remained range-bound. The analytics firm stated that the divergence between whale accumulation and price action suggests that large holders are anticipating bullish momentum despite prices remaining flat. Santiment also noted that the pattern has intensified over the past 24 hours, driven by retail traders exiting positions. Santiment stated that retail investors are selling and taking profits, believing the current rally represents a bull trap. The firm also argued that the combination of whale accumulation and retail profit-taking signals continued growth in crypto markets. On Tuesday, crypto analyst James Check acknowledged there’s heavy supply redistribution in Bitcoin after the asset pushed toward $94,000 at the beginning of the year. He also noted that the top-heavy supply has rebalanced from 67% to 47%, and profit-taking has significantly decreased. The analyst added that futures markets are experiencing a short squeeze, but the overall market leverage remains low. CryptoQuant disputes Bitcoin whale accumulation CryptoQuant revealed that BTC’s bullish momentum this year, together with a range-bound December, signals a change in exchange flow patterns. Binance reported a surge in Bitcoin deposits to 21.7 BTC per transaction last month. The firm noted that the surge represents a 34x hike from the 0.86 BTC average in early January 2024. “The sharp increase in average Bitcoin inflows to Binance suggests that larger holders are becoming more active again, which is typically an early signal of renewed speculation rather than retail-driven noise.” -Wenny Cai, COO of SynFutures. CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, said on Friday that whales are not buying an enormous amount of BTC. He argued that most Bitcoin whale data on-chain has already been affected by exchanges consolidating most of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances. Digital asset exchanges maintain operations by consolidating funds from several smaller wallets into fewer larger ones. The initiative tends to increase the number of wallets holding huge balances, which leads to misleading on-chain data indicating whale accumulation. Moreno believes it’s the reason why whales appear to have accumulated a significant amount of BTC recently. The analyst added that CryptoQuant has data that removes all exchange addresses, which shows whale balances plummeting. He also said the same applies to addresses with 100-1,000 Bitcoins, which capture ETF holdings. The cryptocurrency market has shifted since early 2024 after the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The funds have emerged as major holders of Bitcoin, collectively holding nearly 1.3 million BTC at the time of publication. These funds have altered how large-scale BTC ownership appears on-chain.

While short-term price movements continue to attract attention, deeper structural forces now influence XRP’s long-term outlook. Market participants who focus only on charts risk overlooking the quieter but more powerful mechanics unfolding beneath the surface. In a recent post on X, game designer and crypto market commentator Chad Steingraber urged XRP holders to pay close attention to real-time market behavior rather than speculation. He framed his message as a cautionary note, emphasizing that observable capital flows and institutional participation already provide clues about where the market may head next. Institutional Demand and the Mechanics of Supply Steingraber’s analysis centers on how regulated investment products can steadily drain available XRP from the open market. Unlike retail-driven spikes, institutional products operate on consistency and scale. When funds acquire assets daily, even modest inflows can compound into meaningful supply pressure over time . What happens when the XRP ETF’s are taking 20Million XRP per day from the market? There are more funds coming… big ones. Look at Morgan Stanley just now submitting a Bitcoin ETF two years later. They all will. The best part is, we don’t have to guess.. we can see what’s… — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) January 7, 2026 This dynamic became evident with spot Bitcoin ETFs, which absorbed large quantities of BTC without dramatic daily price shocks. Steingraber argues that XRP could experience a similar effect as more investment vehicles gain exposure to the asset across regulated markets. How Daily Accumulation Scales Over a Year To illustrate the impact of time and consistency, Steingraber outlines a simple but striking projection. A daily acquisition of 20 million XRP results in roughly 100 million XRP absorbed each trading week. Over a month, that figure grows to approximately 400 million XRP. Extended across a full year, cumulative absorption reaches about 4.8 billion XRP. These figures do not rely on aggressive assumptions. Instead, they demonstrate how steady institutional activity can reshape supply dynamics without relying on speculative mania or sudden demand surges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Traditional Finance Is Already Following the Pattern Steingraber reinforces his warning by pointing to how major financial institutions approach digital assets. He references Morgan Stanley’s recent Bitcoin ETF filing, which arrived years after early adopters entered the space. This delayed entry reflects a broader Wall Street pattern of waiting for regulatory clarity and proven market demand. From this perspective, XRP’s role in cross-border payments and liquidity infrastructure positions it as a logical candidate for deeper institutional involvement once conditions align. Steingraber suggests that this process has already begun rather than remaining a distant possibility. A Warning Based on Observation, Not Hype Steingraber repeatedly stresses that investors do not need to guess what might happen. ETF filings, fund inflows, and asset custody data remain visible in real time. His warning focuses on time sensitivity, suggesting that prolonged accumulation could significantly alter XRP’s supply-demand balance sooner than many expect. While uncertainty always defines financial markets, Steingraber’s message highlights a clear takeaway. If institutional absorption continues at scale, XRP’s market structure could shift rapidly, leaving unprepared participants reacting rather than positioning ahead of the change.

Bitcoin has briefly dropped to the $91k level, while Ether is trading at $3,200 per coin. However, HYPE, the native coin of the Hyperliquid DEX, is up 2% in the last 24 hours. It briefly topped the $28 level earlier today but has slightly retraced and is now trading at $27.1 per coin. The coin could rally higher in the near term as derivatives data suggests a buy-side dominance among traders. Furthermore, capital inflows into the project align with positive funding rates and increased participation from whales. If the market conditions improve, HYPE could rally towards the $30 psychological level in the near term. HYPE hits $28 as whale demand increases HYPE is up by 5% in the last seven days and is now trading above $27 per coin. The positive performance comes as retail demand for Hyperliquid has increased in the last few days. According to CoinGlass , the HYPE futures Open Interest (OI) has surged over 7.06% in the last 24 hours, reaching $1.50 billion. The rising OI indicates an inflow of fresh capital into the Hyperliquid ecosystem, including longs and shorts. The funding rate has switched positive and now reads 0.0045%, suggesting that most of the fresh capital injected into the market favors a rally over a price decline. Finally, CryptoQuant’s data reveal a surge in whale orders thanks to the increasing average order size in HYPE futures. The increasing whale order usually boosts the refreshed trend, suggesting further upward movement in the near to medium term. HYPE looks to top the $30 psychological level The HYPE/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient, with the bulls expecting a breakout above the $30 psychological level in the near term. The rally to $28 came after HYPE broke above the local resistance trendline connecting the November 18 and December 4 highs, adding 5% to its value since Sunday. At press time, HYPE is trading at $27.1 after surpassing the $28 level a few hours ago. The coin could embark on a breakout once it tops the 50-day EMA at $29.29, which roughly aligns with the Supertrend indicator line at $29.49. If the $30 psychological barrier is broken, HYPE could experience further buying pressure in the near term, with the next major resistance level at $34.82. The momentum indicators on the 4-hour chart have switched bullish, suggesting that the buyers are currently in control of the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 63 and could enter the overbought region if the buying pressure persists. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is above the zero line, indicating a steady rise in bullish momentum. However, if the pullback turns into a correction, HYPE could retest the nearest support level at $23.50.

On the Bitcoin side, data from spot ETF flows shows that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accumulated approximately $888.6 million over the first few trading days of the year. Buying activity was particularly pronounced on January 5, when inflows reached about $372.5 million, marking the single largest daily purchase in the period. This followed solid inflows of roughly $287.4 million on January 2, before BlackRock added a further $228.7 million on January 6, even as the broader Bitcoin ETF market recorded net outflows that day. BlackRock has also been active in Ethereum, where its spot Ethereum ETF brought in a combined $348.9 million over the same dates. The largest daily Ethereum purchase occurred on January 6, when inflows totaled about $198.8 million. Earlier buying included $102.9 million on January 5 and $47.2 million on January 2, pointing to a steady accumulation pattern rather than a single one-off allocation.

Impact on crypto prices Indeed, BlackRock’s purchases have helped the cryptocurrency market regain momentum in 2026. In this context, Bitcoin is pushing to sustain its price above the $90,000 level, trading at $92,100 as of press time. Meanwhile, Ethereum has established its price above $3,000, trading at $3,218. Bitcoin and Ethereum seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold More broadly, the spot ETF market is attracting increased attention, which could support further price growth in the underlying assets. For instance, banking giant Morgan Stanley has filed with U.S. regulators to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, marking a further expansion of its digital asset strategy. The application, submitted on January 6, seeks approval for a fund that would hold Bitcoin directly and trade on a U.S. exchange if cleared.

Despite a year-end slowdown, the continuing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance is likely to strengthen the market in 2026, members of the industry predict. Czechs trade over 15 billion koruna worth of crypto in a year Cryptocurrency trades on domestic Czech exchanges jumped by half in 2025, reaching 15.5 billion koruna (approx. $750 million), local media revealed this week. Market watchers are attributing the growth to heightened investor interest, indicating that the digital assets are becoming a common item in investment portfolios, the business news outlet Seznam Zprávy noted in a post on Tuesday, quoting a report by the ČTK news agency. Quite naturally, volumes decreased in December by about two-fifths compared to the previous month, but crypto purchases and sales, nevertheless, amounted to about 900 million koruna (almost $43.5 million at current exchange rates), as shown by the data provided by the trading platforms. “December was marked by significantly lower business activity, which corresponds to the seasonal development at the end of the year,” remarked Marek Kyrsch, director of the Anycoin exchange. “This is due to the combination of the holiday period, lower volatility in the markets and partial realization of profits that occurred already in previous weeks,” explained the executive, also quoted by Novinky.cz and the Czech edition of Forbes. In the last month of 2025, his company registered a 50% year-on-year decline in turnover, to 374 million koruna, and a 42% reduction over November. “December illustrated two main tendencies: markets continued their short-term correction after record growth, but at the same time, cryptocurrencies are increasingly integrated into traditional financial infrastructure, which may strengthen their stability in 2026,” commented Ota Janda, CEO of Coingarage, another Czech crypto exchange. Investor interest shrank with the drop in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the most traded cryptocurrency, towards $80,000, but some investors took advantage of the situation to make new purchases, highlighted Rostislav Plachý from the Golden Gate broker. At the same time, he predicted: “We expect further revenue growth and price increases in January. During the year, Bitcoin is projected to swing past last year’s records and surpass $125,000.” Reduced investor interest ahead of Christmas is something typical, amid profit-taking and weaker investment, according to Bit.plus CEO Martin Stránský. Bitcoin trades processed by his service fell by 20% in December, but this is about to change this month. New year to bring more trade and all-time highs “In January, we expect a renewed increase in the volume of trades and also a further increase in the price of Bitcoin, the curve of which has started to go up again in recent days. In January and February, I expect a return to values of over $110 000,” Stránský elaborated. He added that 2025 was a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin. The crypto with the largest market cap started the year at around $100,000 and surpassed this threshold several times before climbing to a historical maximum of over $124,000, followed by the correction to the current levels of around $93,000. Digital assets were definitely integrated into the mainstream last year, emphasized Wood & Company Blockchain+ analyst Tomáš Kalabis, who was also asked for an expert opinion by Czech media. He is convinced that the wide availability of investment products offered by leading financial firms, increasing participation of institutional investors, and clear regulatory anchoring have brought a higher level of confidence and predictability to the market. “Crypto assets have ceased to be seen as marginal or alternative investments and have become a common part of investment portfolios, similar to commodities or technology stocks,” Kalabis insisted, adding that the long-term outlook for this market remains very positive. The news of the increased trading volumes and crypto adoption in Czechia comes after the country’s central bank announced it had acquired BTC for the first time in its history, as reported by Cryptopolitan in mid-November. At the time, the Czech National Bank ( CNB ) unveiled the purchase was part of a pilot project to create a $1 million test portfolio of digital assets, which will also include holdings in U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and tokenized deposits. Later, its Governor Aleš Michl said that the monetary authority in Prague aims to gain direct experience with the technologies that are already changing the way finance works. “We don’t want to simulate reality, we want to touch it,” the crypto-friendly head of the CNB was quoted as stating.

This innovative service, announced in early 2025, enables U.S. workers to seamlessly build a cryptocurrency portfolio through automatic deductions from their regular paychecks. Consequently, this development marks a pivotal shift towards embedding long-term digital asset accumulation into everyday financial routines. Understanding CoinFlip’s Crypto DCA Investment Mechanism CoinFlip’s new program fundamentally automates the dollar-cost averaging strategy for digital assets. Specifically, employees can now authorize a portion of their post-tax earnings to purchase cryptocurrencies on every payday. The service supports a curated selection of assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , and major stablecoins . Moreover, the platform sets a highly accessible minimum investment threshold of just $25 per paycheck. This structure deliberately removes the complexity and emotional decision-making often associated with crypto market volatility. Industry analysts note this model directly addresses a growing demand for disciplined, incremental investment vehicles. For instance, traditional retirement accounts have long utilized similar payroll deduction frameworks. Therefore, applying this proven method to cryptocurrency represents a logical evolution in asset management. The program’s architecture relies on secure, automated buy orders executed at the time of fund settlement. This process ensures consistent investment regardless of short-term price fluctuations. The Strategic Pivot from Physical Kiosks to Digital Finance This launch signifies a major strategic expansion for CoinFlip. Historically, the company established its presence through a vast network of physical Bitcoin ATMs across the United States. These kiosks primarily served users seeking immediate, one-off cryptocurrency transactions. However, the new payroll DCA program targets a completely different user segment: the long-term investor. This pivot demonstrates the company’s adaptation to broader market maturation. Financial technology experts point to several key drivers behind this shift. First, regulatory clarity around digital assets has improved, providing a more stable framework for such products. Second, institutional adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum has created a more robust infrastructure for custody and execution. Finally, sustained interest from younger demographics, who are comfortable with digital-native finance, has created a ready market. CoinFlip’s existing regulatory compliance and operational scale likely facilitated this expansion into automated investment services. Comparative Analysis: Payroll DCA vs. Traditional Crypto Buying To understand the program’s impact, a comparison with conventional cryptocurrency acquisition methods is essential. Feature CoinFlip Payroll DCA Manual Exchange Buying Recurring Buys on Apps Automation Full (pre-paycheck) None Partial (post-deposit) Funding Source Direct payroll deduction Bank transfer/Card Linked bank account Behavioral Benefit “Pay yourself first” investing Requires active discretion Requires maintained balance Primary Goal Long-term wealth accumulation Speculation/Trading Convenient accumulation As the table illustrates, the key differentiator is the integration point . By intercepting funds at the payroll level, the program effectively treats cryptocurrency investment as a non-negotiable expense, similar to a 401(k) contribution. This method leverages behavioral finance principles to promote consistent saving, a tactic less common in the crypto space until now. Implications for the Workforce and Financial Planning The introduction of crypto-based payroll deductions carries profound implications for employee benefits and personal finance. Primarily, it provides a structured, low-barrier entry point for workers curious about digital assets but wary of market timing. Employees can build a position gradually, smoothing out the average purchase price over time—a core tenet of the DCA strategy. Furthermore, this product arrives amid growing discussion about cryptocurrency’s role in diversified retirement portfolios. Several critical considerations emerge for potential users. Participants must understand the tax implications of purchasing taxable assets via payroll. Additionally, they should evaluate the custody solution —how and where CoinFlip secures the purchased assets. The company has stated it partners with regulated custodians, but due diligence remains crucial. Employers offering this as a benefit must also navigate payroll processing integration and their own compliance responsibilities. Early adoption will likely be seen in tech-forward industries first. Expert Perspective on Market Impact and Future Trends Financial advisors specializing in digital assets view this development as a normalization signal. “When investment access moves into the payroll system, it transitions from an alternative hobby to a mainstream financial tool,” notes a fintech analyst from a major consulting firm. This model could pressure other crypto service providers and traditional brokerages to develop similar direct-to-paycheck products. The success of CoinFlip’s program may hinge on its user experience, fee transparency, and educational resources for new investors. Looking ahead, potential evolution includes integration with existing retirement account platforms (e.g., 401(k) providers), support for a broader range of altcoins, or features allowing automatic rebalancing. The program’s growth will also depend on broader cryptocurrency market performance and regulatory developments from bodies like the SEC. Nevertheless, its launch in 2025 firmly places automated, set-and-forget crypto investing on the map for the average American earner. Conclusion CoinFlip’s launch of a crypto DCA investment program via payroll deduction represents a sophisticated leap forward for accessible digital asset accumulation. By automating purchases directly from employee paychecks, the service reduces barriers and instills disciplined investing habits. This initiative reflects the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, merging innovative blockchain-based assets with time-tested savings methodologies. Ultimately, the program’s success will be measured by its ability to provide a secure, simple, and effective path for U.S. workers to participate in the digital economy’s long-term growth, making the crypto DCA investment a potential staple in future financial planning. FAQs Q1: How does CoinFlip’s payroll crypto DCA investment work? The program allows employees to authorize a set dollar amount (minimum $25) to be deducted from each paycheck after taxes. These funds automatically purchase selected cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum on payday, applying a dollar-cost averaging strategy. Q2: What cryptocurrencies can I invest in through this program? Initially, the program supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and select major stablecoins. The asset list may expand based on demand and regulatory considerations. Q3: Are there any tax implications for using a payroll deduction for crypto? Yes. Purchasing cryptocurrency is a taxable event in the U.S. You acquire a cost basis at the time of each purchase. You will be responsible for capital gains taxes when you eventually sell or dispose of the assets. Consult a tax professional for guidance. Q4: How does this differ from setting up recurring buys on a normal exchange? The key difference is funding automation. Payroll deduction invests money before it hits your bank account, enforcing the “pay yourself first” principle. Recurring buys on an exchange require money to already be in your linked bank account, which can be easier to skip or cancel. Q5: Is my investment safe? How does CoinFlip custody the assets? CoinFlip has stated it uses regulated, institutional-grade third-party custodians to secure the digital assets purchased. However, as with any crypto service, users should review the company’s security protocols, insurance coverage, and terms of service to understand the risks and protections fully.

The wallet aims to prevent censorship, offering cross-border asset transfers. Rumble, the social media partner of Tether, announced the launch of a new wallet with censorship-resistant payments. Rumble and Tether, which have partnered to boost stablecoin adoption, launched a non-custodial wallet to bypass banking censorship. Rumble Wallet is here! Built for creators and fans 🐐 pic.twitter.com/HDGiO2rh0r — Rumble 🏴‍☠️ (@rumblevideo) January 7, 2026 Rumble Wallet will be a non-custodial service, leaving video creators in control of their funds. The wallet will support the most widely used USDT stablecoin, Tether Gold (XAUt), BTC, and will have tools for direct cryptocurrency tips. The wallet is touted as the next step for Rumble in creating an independent platform. The video streaming service has been trying to bypass traditional Internet venues by offering alternative storage and censorship-free distribution. The new wallet also allows creators to embed payments directly into the social media platform, eliminating the need for third-party payment processing. The wallet will build on Rumble’s previous tipping technology. Following the news, Rumble (RUM) traded at $6.72, with a small gain for the past week. Rumble and Tether deploy wallet development kit Rumble was the first client to use Tether’s wallet development kit (WDK) for its own platform. The freedom-first social media and streaming service built the wallet from scratch, precisely for the needs of creators. Tether also allows the creation of other white label wallets, with no centralized holding authority. “ Rumble represents free speech and liberty the same way that cryptocurrency and a decentralized internet represent freedom, and Rumble Wallet is the natural combination of those things,” Chris Pavlovski, founder and CEO of Rumble. The new Rumble wallet is an extension of the collaboration between Tether and Rumble. The two companies announced their collaboration during a Bitcoin forum in Lugano, Switzerland. The wallet allows creators to monetize their channels without fear of arbitrary debanking. MoonPay will serve as fiat on-ramp for Rumble Wallet Rumble Wallet will be entirely self-custodial, allowing holders to move assets between wallets or trade on decentralized platforms. The wallet will still allow for a fiat on-ramp to deposit funds, as well as trade and withdraw. MoonPay, one of the most widely used payment processors for crypto onboarding, will be integrated with the wallet.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Breakdown Maps Out Performance",https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-season-in-q1-performance/,bitcoinist,"A crypto market expert has predicted a strong altcoin season in the first quarter of 2026, pointing to recent price action for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as key indicators. The analyst noted that Bitcoin’s steady consolidation and Ethereum’s recovery from price dips are laying the groundwork for a bullish shift in the altcoin market. Bitcoin And Ethereum Trends Signal Altcoin Season In Q1 2026 A market analyst identified as ‘ChainHub’ on X has announced that the crypto market is showing signs of an altcoin season in Q1 2026. He shared a detailed breakdown of Bitcoin and Ethereum setups that indicate and support a strong altcoin performance in February and March this year. Compared to 2021, which saw the last altcoin season , this cycle’s rally has been delayed by three months, pushing a potential altseason into Q1 after Bitcoin completed its distribution phase. ChainHub notes that BTC’s price bottom came a little earlier than expected. He highlighted that refined lower-time-frame cycles initially suggested a bottom would form between mid-January and early February in 2026. However, BTC bottomed out by late December 2025. Notably, the analyst disclosed that while Bitcoin remains extremely bearish , this creates an ideal opportunity for altcoins to lead when BTC dominance weakens. Due to its ongoing bear market, ChainHub has predicted that BTC is unlikely to reach a new all-time high soon. He estimates that the cryptocurrency’s next price top could be around $107,000 to $108,000, representing a more than 15% decline from its ATH above $126,000 . While BTC’s slow performance supports an altcoin season in 2026, Ethereum is showing mixed signals. ChainHub disclosed that on shorter timeframes, the ETH price is less bullish , but longer-term charts point to the potential for a new all-time high near $5,000-$5,500. He revealed that Ethereum bottoming around $2,600- $2,700 is not a reliable indicator of an upcoming altseason. However, its overall bullish nature supports long-term upward momentum. The analyst also noted that the ETH/Silver ratio points to a rotation from precious metals into cryptocurrencies, signaling renewed investor interest in alts after October 2025’s missed rotation expectations. According to ChainHub, these developments suggest a strong altcoin season in Q1, especially as BTC’s dominance declines and demand for alts rises. Analyst Sees Alt Rally As Market Strengthens ChainHub has remained bullish and confident that an altseason will occur in Q1, after setups in Q4 2025, such as Dogecoin and SUI, successfully reversed and found their bottoms. He revealed that Total3 and others are the primary focus of the pump. Because of this, he is targeting filling gaps from October 10 , though the altcoin sector’s strength could push prices beyond these levels. According to ChainHub, some altcoins may even reach their extreme highs from summer 2025, with bullish continuation providing opportunities to buy during price dips. The analyst noted that, since Bitcoin and Ethereum are not performing as well as alts in the current market, he expects a pivot by mid-January. He says this pivot could act as a retest, which could be even more bullish for alts and provide additional fuel for upward moves.",Crypto News|Altcoin Season|altcoins|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|ChainHub|dogecoin|ETH/Silver|Ethereum|SUI,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

A 2026 Investor Safety Warning,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/www-cryptonews-com-encryptobit-scam-review-2026/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Is Encryptobit a Scam? A 2026 Investor Safety Warning As of January 7, 2026 , Encryptobit is not recognized as a legitimate cryptocurrency project or registered exchange in the global financial market. It does not appear on trusted 2026 price trackers like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko , nor is it regulated by financial authorities such as the SEC or FIU-IND . Instead, the name is frequently flagged in connection with fake investment platforms and “Pig Butchering” schemes—fraudulent operations that lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns before stealing their funds. This guide analyzes the red flags of Encryptobit and highlights verifiable 2026 crypto trends. Why Is Encryptobit Considered a High-Risk Scam in 2026? Financial analysts and cybersecurity experts warn that Encryptobit exhibits classic signs of a Ponzi scheme or investment fraud. In the high-growth environment of the 2026 crypto bull run , scammers often use professional-sounding names to mimic legitimate institutions. Guaranteed Returns: The platform reportedly promises fixed monthly profits (e.g., 10–50%). In legitimate finance, no asset can guarantee such high yields without risk; this is a hallmark of a Ponzi scheme . Withdrawal Fees (The Trap): A common tactic used by scams like Encryptobit is showing “fake profits” on a dashboard. When users attempt to withdraw, they are blocked and told they must first pay “taxes” or “service fees.” This is a secondary theft attempt; no legitimate exchange charges upfront fees to release your own money. Lack of Regulation: Legitimate platforms must adhere to strict compliance rules. Encryptobit has no verifiable physical address, no known development team, and lacks registration with major regulatory bodies, making legal recourse nearly impossible for victims. What Are the Actual Legitimate Crypto Trends in 2026? While scams like Encryptobit rely on obscurity, the real 2026 crypto landscape is defined by transparency, utility, and institutional adoption. Investors are currently focusing on these verified sectors: Bitcoin (BTC) & Institutional Growth: Bitcoin has solidified its status as “digital gold,” trading near all-time highs of over $150,000 . Its growth is driven by massive inflows from institutional ETFs and corporate treasury adoption, distinguishing it sharply from unverified speculative tokens. AI & Crypto Convergence: The intersection of Artificial Intelligence and blockchain is a dominant trend. Legitimate projects like Bittensor (TAO) and Fetch.ai (FET) are building decentralized machine learning networks, offering real-world utility that vague platforms like Encryptobit lack. Real-World Assets (RWA): The tokenization of government bonds , private credit, and real estate has become a multi-billion dollar sector. Investors are using regulated platforms to trade on-chain representations of tangible assets, moving away from the “vaporware” common in previous cycles. How Can You Protect Yourself from Crypto Scams in 2026? If you have been approached to invest in Encryptobit , immediate caution is required. Follow this safety checklist to verify any platform before depositing funds. Do Not Deposit Funds: Treat Encryptobit as a “black hole.” Most funds sent to such platforms are irretrievable. If you have already deposited, do not send more money to “unlock” withdrawals. Verify the URL: Scammers often clone legitimate sites. Always check the URL carefully for subtle misspellings (e.g., “Coinbbase” instead of “Coinbase”) and ensure the site uses a secure connection. Check Major Exchanges: If a token claims to be “famous” or “the next big thing” but is not listed on Binance , Coinbase , Bybit , or Kraken , it is almost certainly a high-risk or fake asset. Legitimate projects have liquidity on recognized global exchanges. Frequently Asked Questions Can I get my money back from Encryptobit? Recovering funds from unregulated platforms like Encryptobit is extremely difficult. Because cryptocurrencies are decentralized and the platform likely operates anonymously, there is no central authority to reverse the transaction. You should report the incident to your local cybercrime unit (e.g., the FBI’s IC3 or the FIU ), but be wary of “recovery services” online, as many are also scams targeting previous victims. Is Encryptobit a new cryptocurrency being released in 2026? No, there is no verifiable evidence that Encryptobit is a legitimate new cryptocurrency. It does not have a whitepaper, a public GitHub repository, or a known team of developers—standard requirements for any real blockchain project. It appears to be a fake investment platform designed solely to collect deposits. Why do people keep recommending Encryptobit on social media? Scammers often use bot networks and fake profiles on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and Instagram to create an illusion of popularity. They may also use “romance scam” tactics (known as Pig Butchering ), where a fake romantic partner builds trust over months before convincing the victim to invest in a specific fraudulent platform like Encryptobit. Conclusion In 2026 , the gap between legitimate digital finance and predatory scams is wider than ever. Encryptobit displays all the warning signs of a financial trap: guaranteed returns, anonymity, and withdrawal barriers. Investors should strictly avoid this platform and instead focus on the regulated, utility-driven sectors of the market—such as Bitcoin , AI protocols , and Real-World Assets —where transparency and security are the standards. Prioritizing due diligence over “get-rich-quick” promises is the only way to safeguard your capital in the digital age. This post Is Encryptobit a Scam?

56939036,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259433,1767798612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bloomberg Strategist Warns of Potential $50K Support Retest in 2026 Amid Market Volatility Signals,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-2026-support/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bloomberg Strategist Warns of Potential $50K Support Retest in 2026 Amid Market Volatility Signals NEW YORK, March 2025 – Senior Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone has issued a significant Bitcoin price prediction, suggesting the cryptocurrency could potentially retest the $50,000 support level in 2026. This analysis emerges amid complex market dynamics involving stock volatility, gold performance, and historical correlation patterns that have previously signaled major cryptocurrency corrections. McGlone’s warning carries particular weight given his track record of macroeconomic forecasting and Bloomberg’s position as a leading financial intelligence provider. Bitcoin Price Prediction and Market Correlation Dynamics Mike McGlone’s Bitcoin price prediction rests on observable market relationships that have demonstrated historical reliability. The senior macro strategist specifically highlights the connection between Bitcoin’s valuation and stock market volatility metrics. Furthermore, he points to the recent strength in gold prices as a potential leading indicator of future market stress. These interconnected factors create a complex web of signals that experienced analysts monitor for directional clues. Historical data reveals that periods of low stock volatility combined with surging gold prices have rarely proven sustainable. Consequently, this unusual combination often precedes market corrections across multiple asset classes. McGlone’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin, despite its unique characteristics, remains susceptible to these broader financial market forces. The cryptocurrency’s maturation has paradoxically increased its correlation with traditional risk assets during certain market phases. The Gold-Bitcoin Relationship: Historical Context Gold has traditionally served as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty. Interestingly, Bitcoin initially positioned itself as “digital gold” with similar inflation-hedge properties. However, market behavior during recent stress periods reveals a more complex relationship. Analysts have documented three distinct phases of gold-Bitcoin correlation since 2020: 2020-2021: Divergent paths with Bitcoin outperforming during liquidity surges 2022-2023: Increased correlation during Federal Reserve tightening cycles 2024-Present: Gold strength preceding potential Bitcoin weakness McGlone specifically notes that a significant gold price spike in 2025 could serve as a leading signal for 2026 market stress. This pattern recognition stems from decades of commodity market analysis at Bloomberg Intelligence. The firm’s data systems track thousands of cross-asset relationships, providing strategists with comprehensive correlation matrices. Stock Market Volatility and Cryptocurrency Corrections Stock market instability represents another crucial factor in McGlone’s Bitcoin price prediction. The VIX index, which measures expected stock market volatility, has shown increasing correlation with cryptocurrency movements since 2022. When traditional markets experience turbulence, investors frequently rebalance portfolios away from perceived risk assets. Bitcoin, despite its decentralized nature, often faces selling pressure during these risk-off periods. Historical analysis reveals specific conditions that typically precede cryptocurrency corrections: Condition Historical Precedent Average Correction VIX spike + Gold surge Q4 2018, Q1 2020, Q2 2022 -42% Low volatility + Gold strength Q3 2019, Q1 2021 -28% Fed tightening + Risk aversion 2013, 2018, 2022 -52% McGlone emphasizes that current market conditions resemble several historical precedents. The combination of specific volatility metrics and commodity movements creates what technical analysts call “confluence” – multiple indicators pointing toward similar outcomes. This analytical approach forms the foundation of institutional-grade market forecasting. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Analytical Framework Bloomberg Intelligence employs a multi-factor model for cryptocurrency analysis that incorporates dozens of variables. Their framework extends beyond simple price charts to include: Macroeconomic indicators and central bank policies Cross-asset correlation matrices updated in real-time On-chain cryptocurrency metrics and network activity Institutional flow data and derivatives positioning Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions This comprehensive approach allows analysts like McGlone to identify patterns that might escape narrower analytical frameworks. The $50,000 Bitcoin price prediction emerges from this sophisticated modeling, rather than simple technical analysis. Bloomberg’s systems continuously backtest predictions against historical data, refining their accuracy over time. Potential Market Impacts and Sector Implications A Bitcoin correction to $50,000 would represent approximately a 40% decline from current levels, assuming specific entry points. Such a movement would inevitably affect related market sectors. Cryptocurrency mining operations face particular sensitivity to Bitcoin price fluctuations, as their profitability depends directly on network valuation. Additionally, cryptocurrency-focused investment funds and publicly traded companies would experience portfolio impacts. The broader digital asset ecosystem would likely see correlated movements. Historical data indicates that altcoins frequently experience more severe corrections than Bitcoin during risk-off periods. However, market structure has evolved significantly since previous cycles. Increased institutional participation and regulated derivatives markets may potentially dampen volatility compared to earlier corrections. Regulatory developments also play a crucial role in market stability. Clearer frameworks in major jurisdictions could provide support during corrections, while regulatory uncertainty might exacerbate declines. The evolving relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets creates new dynamics that analysts must continually assess. Historical Support Level Analysis The $50,000 level carries particular technical significance for Bitcoin. This price point has served as both resistance and support during multiple market phases since 2021. Market memory often creates psychological barriers at round numbers, and $50,000 represents a major psychological threshold. Additionally, on-chain analysis reveals significant accumulation around this level, suggesting substantial buyer interest that could provide support during corrections. Several factors contribute to the $50,000 level’s importance: Institutional entry points: Many funds established positions near this level Options positioning: High open interest at $50,000 strike prices Mining economics: Break-even points for efficient mining operations Technical patterns: Previous consolidation and reversal zones McGlone’s prediction specifically references retesting this support level, implying it might hold during a correction. Support retests often create buying opportunities for long-term investors, though timing remains challenging. The 2026 timeframe allows for multiple macroeconomic developments that could alter the prediction’s validity. Alternative Scenarios and Market Evolution While McGlone presents a cautious Bitcoin price prediction, market evolution could alter these dynamics. Several potential developments might mitigate or prevent the predicted correction: First, increasing Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset by corporations or nations could fundamentally alter its correlation patterns. Second, the potential approval of additional cryptocurrency ETFs might increase institutional buying pressure. Third, technological developments like the Lightning Network could enhance Bitcoin’s utility beyond pure speculation. Finally, macroeconomic conditions might diverge from historical patterns due to unprecedented central bank policies. The cryptocurrency market has consistently defied simple predictions throughout its history. While correlations with traditional assets have increased, Bitcoin maintains unique characteristics that occasionally produce divergent behavior. Seasoned analysts therefore consider multiple scenarios rather than single outcomes. McGlone’s prediction represents one plausible path based on current indicators, not an inevitable conclusion. Risk Management Considerations for Investors Professional investors typically use predictions like McGlone’s for risk management rather than market timing. Several strategies emerge from this analysis: Position sizing: Adjusting exposure based on volatility expectations Hedging: Using derivatives to protect against downside scenarios Diversification: Allocating across uncorrelated assets Dollar-cost averaging: Systematic investment regardless of predictions Bloomberg Intelligence regularly emphasizes that predictions represent probabilities, not certainties. Their analysis aims to inform rather than dictate investment decisions. The firm’s clients include some of the world’s largest financial institutions that incorporate this research into broader investment frameworks. Conclusion Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone’s Bitcoin price prediction highlights potential vulnerability around the $50,000 support level in 2026. This analysis stems from observable correlations between cryptocurrency prices, stock market volatility, and gold movements. Historical patterns suggest that current market conditions resemble previous periods preceding corrections. However, cryptocurrency markets continue evolving, potentially altering established relationships. Investors should consider multiple scenarios while maintaining appropriate risk management strategies. McGlone’s warning serves as a reminder that even maturing assets like Bitcoin remain subject to broader financial market forces. FAQs Q1: What specific indicators does Mike McGlone cite for his Bitcoin price prediction? McGlone points to the combination of low stock market volatility with surging gold prices as historically unsustainable conditions that often precede market corrections. He specifically monitors the VIX index and gold’s performance as leading indicators for potential Bitcoin weakness. Q2: How reliable have Bloomberg’s previous cryptocurrency predictions been? Bloomberg Intelligence has maintained a strong track record in macroeconomic forecasting, though cryptocurrency predictions inherently carry higher uncertainty. Their 2020-2021 Bitcoin analysis correctly identified key trends, while their 2022 warnings about correlation with traditional risk assets proved accurate during that year’s downturn. Q3: Does the $50,000 prediction account for potential Bitcoin adoption increases? The analysis considers current adoption trends but emphasizes that correlation patterns with traditional assets have strengthened despite adoption growth. McGlone’s model incorporates multiple variables but prioritizes observable market relationships over speculative adoption scenarios. Q4: How should long-term Bitcoin investors respond to this prediction? Long-term investors typically maintain core positions regardless of short-to-medium-term predictions. Many professionals recommend dollar-cost averaging and portfolio diversification rather than attempting to time markets based on any single analyst’s forecast. Q5: What time frame makes McGlone’s Bitcoin price prediction most relevant? The prediction specifically references 2026, allowing for intervening developments that could alter market dynamics. Analysts generally consider predictions beyond 12-18 months as directional guidance rather than precise forecasts, as numerous variables can change over extended periods.

According to him, market stability, US legislative progress, and the equity market backdrop are important factors to sustain the bullish momentum. Matt Hougan acknowledged that “crypto is off to a good start in 2026.” So far, the top 10 crypto coins have managed to sustain a week’s surge. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, BNB, Solana, Tron, Dogecoin , and Cardano have all recorded increases of 3.8%, 7.6%, 20.2%, 4.3%, 9.7%, 4.8%, 20.5%, and 18.1%. According to Hougan, the crypto community has moved past concerns that caused a bloodbath in the market in the fourth quarter. He stated that these concerns stemmed from the largest liquidation event in its history on October 10, which wiped out $19 billion in futures in a single day. It raised concerns that the event had impaired major market makers and/or hedge funds. Stock market must remain stable for the crypto market to thrive According to Matt Hougan, although the crypto markets are steady, the passage of the CLARITY Act is key to the long-term future of crypto in the US. “ Without legislation, the current pro-crypto regulatory tilt at the SEC, CFTC, and other agencies could reverse under a new administration,” he added. The bill is currently making its way through Congress. The Senate is targeting January 15 for markup, a process that involves aligning drafts in the Senate banking and agriculture committees and pushing the final bill to a vote. However, hurdles remain, including competing visions of how to regulate DeFi, stablecoin rewards, and political conflicts of interest. David Sacks, the White House crypto czar, stated that “we are closer than ever” to passing the bill. Kalshi puts the odds at 46% by May and 82% by year’s end. Matt Hougan stated that he is cautiously optimistic. Ultimately, the crypto community should pray for the stock markets, as the overall stability of the stock market is crucial for the crypto market to thrive. “We don’t need a raging bull market; crypto is not highly correlated with stocks. But a sharp collapse—say, a 20% pullback in the S&P 500—would take the shine off of all risk assets in the short term, crypto included,” Hougan stated . However, prediction markets see a relatively low probability of a recession in 2026 and approximately 80% probability of S&P 500 gains . However, the AI bubble remains a significant concern. Overall crypto market cap plummets 3% The crypto market has recorded a 3.07% decline in market cap in the last 24 hours. According to analysts, this week’s strengthening of the crypto market has hit local resistance near the $3.2 trillion total capitalization level. The market recovery in early December also stalled at around these levels, which is why the current level is attracting some cautious sellers. For now, the recovery is being stifled by intense selling pressure, which calls for caution about the near-term outlook. In the same light, CryptoQuant stated that the sentiment that crypto whales are aggressively buying up Bitcoin is not true. Instead, their activity is overestimated due to distortions associated with the work of crypto exchanges. According to analysts, the inflow of crypto may be linked to holders’ desire to sell their assets. However, over the past week, the Binance exchange has recorded the most significant inflow of Bitcoin and Ethereum in a month, amounting to nearly $2.4 billion. Also, a rare buy signal has appeared on the weekly Bitcoin chart according to the McMillan Volatility Band indicator. In the entire history of BTC, such a signal has appeared only three times, and each time it coincided with successful buying points.

Crypto Market Rally Stalls The cryptocurrency market retreated over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and other tokens trading lower. BTC faced a major sell wall around $95,000 as price action weakened in comparison to gold. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $94,352 on Tuesday but lost momentum at upper levels. As a result, the price fell to an intraday low of $91,526 before moving to its current level. BTC is down 1.26% over the past 24 hours, trading around $92,583. ETH withstood selling pressure to reach an intraday high of $3,301 on Tuesday before dropping to $3,193. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency regained momentum to reclaim $3,200 and move to its current level of $3,251, up 0.50%. XRP posted a stunning rally over the past week and was up nearly 15% over the past week by Tuesday. However, the rally stalled on Wednesday, and XRP fell almost 3% to $2.27. Despite the decline, XRP is up 22% over the past week. Solana (SOL) is up over 1% at $139, and Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 1% at $0.150. Cardano (ADA) is trading in positive territory at $0.419 while Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 1% at $13.87. Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable price increases over the past 24 hours. However, Toncoin (TON) and Stellar (XLM) bucked the bullish trend, trading in the red. The crypto market cap is marginally down over the past 24 hours, while 24-hour trading volume is up 5% at $132 billion. Strategy’s First Bitcoin Buy Of 2026 Michael Saylor’s Strategy kick-started 2026 with a $116 million Bitcoin buy. The company purchased 1,283 BTC between January 1 and January 4, taking its total Bitcoin holdings past 673,000 BTC. According to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, the firm's total Bitcoin holdings are valued at $62.6 billion, purchased at an average cost of $75,026 per coin. Strategy has also increased its US Dollar reserve by $62 million to $2.25 billion. The company uses its cash reserves to support payments on dividends, preferred stock, and interest payments on outstanding debt. Strategy’s latest purchase comes despite the company posting an unrealized loss of $17.4 billion on its Bitcoin holdings in Q4 2025. It also reported a $5 billion associated deferred tax benefit, a potential reduction in its income tax liabilities.

The surge wasn’t the result of a single cause, but rather a convergence of changing power between buying and selling pressure, improving institutional interest, on-chain signals pointing to a stabilizing market, and unexpected political developments in Venezuela that seem to have contributed to an appetite for risk assets. Geopolitical Risk-On Sentiment And Institutional Flows One of the important forces behind Bitcoin’s push towards $94,000 was the willingness among investors to take on risk across global markets, a mood shift that was shaped in part by dramatic political developments in Venezuela. News that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by US forces caused a chain reaction through equities, commodities and crypto, lifting risk-on sentiment as traders assessed the broader economic and geopolitical implications of the event. Perhaps the most interesting news event is the chatter around a potential Venezuelan shadow $60 billion Bitcoin reserve. This backdrop of rising confidence played into a broader return of institutional capital to Bitcoin. US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted significant net inflows at the start of 2026, with $116.95 million coming in on Friday, January 2 and $123.52 million coming in on Monday, January 5. These inflows helped lift the price of Bitcoin back into the low $90,000s and provided traction as buyers stepped in after the new year holiday lull. On-Chain Metrics Shows A Changing Market Tone According to analytical data from Glassnode, Bitcoin’s market structure is stabilizing in the $80,000 to $95,000 range, sell pressure is beginning to fade, and momentum is beginning to recover. Momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index have moved into an upper-neutral zone, which shows a build-up in upside potential. Spot liquidity, though still thin, has expanded modestly without signs of speculative excess. Related Reading: Same XRP Setup That Led To Over 1,000% Increase In 2017 Is Playing Out Again Glassnode noted that open interest is rebuilding cautiously and that options markets point to short-term volatility, which is a sign of both increasing participation and lingering sensitivity to profit-taking. On-chain activity also shows a reduction in sell-side aggression alongside modestly improving spot volumes. However, Glassnode noted that structural demand is still subdued, and this places the recovery above $90,000 as a fragile one. Bitcoin Price Momentum.

The question now is whether this move signals the start of a sustained advance back above $100,000 or a temporary peak within a still-uneven market landscape. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $92,780, down by 0.5% from its intraday high of $94,343.

New data now suggest that the rally is being driven primarily by spot demand rather than aggressive leverage. Experts say that this is a structurally healthy dynamic. BTC Enters “Moderate Expansion” According to a report by crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., Bitcoin has transitioned into what Adler describes as a “moderate expansion” phase following a period of heavy deleveraging in December. This is reflected in the composite derivatives pressure index, which has moved back into positive territory after spending much of last month near or below zero. The index, which aggregates metrics such as open interest momentum, price momentum, divergence, and acceleration using a 90-day Z-score, currently points to an improving sentiment without reaching historically overheated levels. In fact, readings remain well below the +1.5 threshold typically associated with excessive optimism, which means that the market is expanding in a controlled manner rather than entering a speculative frenzy. At the same time, Adler also found an important divergence between BTC’s price and derivatives activity over the past week. While prices have risen, OI has grown at a slower pace, which resulted in negative divergence – an inverse of the mid-December environment, when leverage was building even as prices declined. Such a trend indicates that traders are not aggressively chasing the rally with borrowed capital, a dynamic that has historically been associated with more sustainable uptrends. The combination of a positive composite index and negative price-OI divergence validates the narrative that spot buyers, rather than leveraged traders, are currently setting the market’s direction. Adler explained that this structure reduces the risk of sudden liquidation cascades, which often occur when leverage accumulates too quickly. He added that a move into a stronger expansion regime would require both price and OI to break higher thresholds at the same time. Deterioration risks, on the other hand, would emerge if OI accelerates sharply without corresponding price support. For now, the market appears to be in a normal trend phase with gradual participation rather than euphoria. Persistent Bitcoin Outflows Beyond derivatives, on-chain supply metrics indicate a healthier market setup. As reported by CryptoPotato , Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since 2018. In fact, only about 13.7% of the total supply is now held on trading platforms. Binance holds roughly 3.2% of all BTC in circulation. This indicates a long-term trend rather than a short-term move. Moreover, fewer coins are being sent to exchanges, which means that holders are not rushing to sell. Instead, netflow charts point to steady outflows in recent weeks, particularly December 22 and January 5, which saw sizable exchange withdrawals.

The award will serve as an incentive to motivate the CEO to create long-term value for shareholders. GameStop’s Board of Directors has issued a high-performance stock option to the company’s chairman and CEO, Ryan Cohen. The award consists of a package worth approximately $3.54 billion if Cohen can lead the company to a tenfold increase in market value and a significant boost in profits. Cohen will only receive the award if the company’s market capitalization grows to $100 billion. The company will also need to achieve $10 billion in cumulative performance earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Cohen’s compensation is tied to GameStop’s long-term performance According to a press release , Mr. Cohen will not receive any guaranteed compensation, including salaries and cash bonuses. His compensation is contingent upon the company’s performance and the success of its operations. The press release detailed that the incentive ensures Cohen’s directives align with the company’s overall objective of creating “long-term value for GameStop’s stockholders.” Cohen’s award includes stock options to purchase 171,537,327 shares of the company’s Class A common stock at a price of $20.66 per share. The award is structured in nine tranches that can only be vested if the company achieves its predetermined market cap and cumulative performance EBITDA hurdles. Cohen’s vesting tranches and the required milestones. Source: GameStop The first tranche vests only if the company’s market cap rises to $20 billion. The subsequent tranches will only be vested when the company adds $10 billion to its market cap until the goal of $100 billion is achieved. Cohen must also ensure the gaming company meets its profit targets. The first tranche requires a cumulative performance EBITDA of $2.0 billion, while subsequent targets increase for each following tranche up to a cumulative amount of $10 billion. Ryan Cohen joined GameStop in January 2021 when the company had a market cap of $1.3 billion. According to the publication, the CEO managed to lift the company’s current market cap to $9.3 billion, representing a 615% return to shareholders. Cohen also oversaw a decrease in total selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses to $950.8 million for the most recent trailing four fiscal quarters, down from $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2021. The figures represent a 44.4% reduction in expenses. Cohen’s leadership turns GameStop profitable In 2021, GameStop realized a net loss of $381.3 million. However, Cohen’s leadership has transformed the company into a net income of $421.8 million for the most recent trailing four fiscal quarters. Cohen and the GameStop board reached a consensus on January 6. However, the proposal will now be presented to the company’s shareholders, who will need to approve it before its implementation. GameStop is expected to hold a special meeting in March or April this year to vote on the proposal. GameStop’s YTD performance. Source: Google Finance Da ta from Google Finance shows that GameStop is up 4.15% today, following a 5% surge in the premarket, and is trading at $20.66 per share at the time of this publication. The company’s stock price is still down 7.77% in the last month, but has managed to achieve a 6.27% increase YTD. The news comes after the company’s stock fell in mid-December following a drop in the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Cryptopolitan reported that the company lost $9.2 million from Bitcoin’s correction at the time, causing its stock to fall by 5%. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, GameStop claims the 23rd position among public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings. The data shows that the gaming retailer holds 4,710 Bitcoin in its books, valued at $431.91 million at current BTC prices.

His recent analysis suggests the hypothetical arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. authorities could catalyze a Bitcoin rally reaching $200,000 by March 2026. This prediction emerges from complex interactions between monetary policy, resource control, and digital asset valuation. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Connecting Geopolitics to Cryptocurrency Arthur Hayes presents a detailed framework linking international politics to cryptocurrency valuation. He bases his analysis on historical patterns of monetary expansion during geopolitical crises. The Venezuelan situation provides a contemporary case study for this relationship. Venezuela possesses the world’s largest proven oil reserves at approximately 304 billion barrels. Control of these resources could significantly impact global energy markets and currency dynamics. Hayes references previous instances where geopolitical events influenced cryptocurrency markets. For example, Bitcoin demonstrated notable price movements during the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Similarly, cryptocurrency adoption increased in Venezuela during hyperinflation periods. These precedents establish connections between political instability and digital asset valuation. Monetary Expansion and Asset Seizure Mechanics The proposed mechanism involves multiple interconnected financial processes. First, potential seizure of Venezuelan oil assets could provide the U.S. government with substantial revenue streams. Second, this revenue might facilitate continued monetary expansion without immediate inflationary consequences. Third, increased dollar supply typically correlates with rising asset prices across multiple categories. Historical data supports portions of this analysis. The U.S. monetary base expanded from approximately $4 trillion in early 2020 to over $6 trillion by 2023. During this period, Bitcoin’s price increased from around $7,000 to peaks exceeding $60,000. While correlation doesn’t establish causation, the relationship merits examination by financial analysts. Expert Analysis and Market Context Arthur Hayes brings substantial cryptocurrency market experience to his prediction. He co-founded BitMEX, one of the earliest and most influential cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges. His previous market predictions have demonstrated mixed accuracy, like most financial forecasting. However, his institutional perspective provides valuable insights into market mechanics. Other financial experts offer varying perspectives on similar geopolitical scenarios. Some economists argue that asset seizures might create market uncertainty rather than stability. Others suggest alternative outcomes for cryptocurrency markets during geopolitical crises. These diverse viewpoints highlight the complexity of predicting financial market reactions to political events. Historical Geopolitical Events and Bitcoin Price Impact Event Timeframe Bitcoin Price Change Russia-Ukraine Conflict Start Feb 2022 +15% in 30 days r> U.S.-China Trade War Escalation Aug 2019 +20% in 60 days Brexit Referendum Jun 2016 +35% in 90 days Cyprus Banking Crisis Mar 2013 +500% in 6 months Venezuela’s Economic Position and Cryptocurrency Adoption Venezuela presents a unique case study in cryptocurrency adoption during economic crisis. The country experienced hyperinflation exceeding 1,000,000% annually in recent years. This economic environment drove significant Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption among Venezuelan citizens. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volumes in Venezuela consistently rank among global leaders despite economic challenges. The Venezuelan government launched its own cryptocurrency, the Petro, in 2018. This state-backed digital currency faced international skepticism and limited adoption. However, it demonstrated government recognition of cryptocurrency’s potential role in economic systems. Current cryptocurrency usage in Venezuela includes: Remittances: Venezuelans abroad use cryptocurrencies to send funds to family members Savings preservation: Citizens convert bolivars to Bitcoin to protect against hyperinflation International trade: Businesses use cryptocurrencies to bypass financial restrictions Daily transactions: Growing merchant acceptance for routine purchases Potential Market Impacts and Risk Considerations Financial analysts identify several potential market impacts from the scenario Hayes describes. Increased monetary expansion typically benefits scarce assets like Bitcoin through several mechanisms. First, it reduces the purchasing power of fiat currencies over time. Second, it encourages investment in alternative stores of value. Third, it may increase institutional cryptocurrency adoption as hedge strategies. However, significant risks and uncertainties accompany this prediction. Geopolitical developments rarely follow linear or predictable paths. Market reactions to political events often defy conventional analysis. Additionally, regulatory responses to cryptocurrency markets continue evolving across jurisdictions. These factors introduce substantial unpredictability into any long-term price prediction. Historical Precedents and Pattern Recognition Financial historians note similar patterns throughout economic history. During periods of geopolitical tension and monetary expansion, alternative assets frequently appreciate. Gold traditionally served this function during previous crises. Bitcoin increasingly assumes similar characteristics in contemporary markets, though with greater volatility. The 2008 financial crisis provides relevant historical context. Following extensive monetary stimulus measures, gold prices increased approximately 400% over the subsequent five years. Bitcoin proponents suggest similar dynamics could drive cryptocurrency appreciation during current geopolitical tensions. However, important differences exist between traditional and digital asset markets. Conclusion Arthur Hayes presents a compelling Bitcoin price prediction connecting geopolitical developments to cryptocurrency valuation. His analysis suggests potential pathways toward $200,000 Bitcoin by March 2026, contingent on specific geopolitical scenarios. This prediction rests on established relationships between monetary expansion, resource control, and asset appreciation. While uncertainties remain substantial, the analysis provides valuable perspective on cryptocurrency market dynamics. Financial markets continue evolving in response to geopolitical developments, with digital assets playing increasingly significant roles in global finance. FAQs Q1: What specific mechanism does Arthur Hayes propose for Bitcoin’s potential price increase? Hayes suggests that potential U.S. seizure of Venezuelan oil assets could facilitate continued monetary expansion without immediate inflation, increasing dollar supply and consequently driving Bitcoin and other scarce asset prices upward through established economic relationships. Q2: How does Venezuela’s current economic situation relate to cryptocurrency markets? Venezuela experiences hyperinflation and economic sanctions, driving significant cryptocurrency adoption among citizens for remittances, savings preservation, and transactions, creating a real-world laboratory for cryptocurrency utility during economic crisis. Q3: What historical evidence supports connections between geopolitical events and Bitcoin price movements? Historical data shows Bitcoin price increases following events like the Russia-Ukraine conflict (+15% in 30 days), U.S.-China trade war escalation (+20% in 60 days), and the Cyprus banking crisis (+500% in 6 months), though correlation doesn’t guarantee future patterns. Q4: How reliable are Arthur Hayes’ previous cryptocurrency predictions? Like most financial forecasters, Hayes has demonstrated mixed accuracy in previous predictions, though his institutional experience provides valuable market insights that merit consideration alongside other expert analyses and fundamental research. Q5: What risks and uncertainties accompany this Bitcoin price prediction? Significant uncertainties include unpredictable geopolitical developments, potential regulatory changes, market volatility factors, technological developments, and the complex interplay between monetary policy and asset valuation in evolving financial systems.

This filing, which aims to create an exchange-traded fund directly holding Ethereum (ETH), comes shortly after the bank’s applications for spot Bitcoin and Solana ETFs. With Wall Street accelerating the embrace of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the bank’s application with the SEC points to a deepening commitment to digital assets. Morgan Stanley eyes spot Ethereum ETF: What it means Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest wealth managers, previously lifted restrictions related to crypto in October 2025. This is when the bank moved to allow its financial advisors to recommend spot crypto ETFs to clients, a policy shift that showed greater client interest. Other banking giants have taken this step as investors look to diversify their portfolios. According to market experts, this ETF registration marks a pivotal advancement as crypto ETFs record fresh demand in 2026. The renewed institutional confidence is visible as the market witnesses a flip following a volatile period that saw US spot Bitcoin ETFs notch billions in net outflows. On January 6, 2025, SoSoValue data showed Bitcoin saw net outflows of $243 million. Only BlackRock’s IBIT ETF netted net inflows. However, Monday had seen over $697 million in net inflows, the highest single-day figure for BTC since early October. Elsewhere, Ethereum spot ETFs saw $115 million in daily net inflows, the third consecutive day of positive flows. The market also had inflows for Solana and XRP spot ETFs, recorded at $9.22 million and $19.12 million, respectively. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum funds faced outflows during a challenging Q4 2025, exacerbated by price corrections, institutional momentum appears to be rebounding strongly. In this case, market analysts view Morgan Stanley’s action as a potential turning point. ETF expert Nate Geraci noted on X : Back in October, Morgan Stanley dropped restrictions on financial advisors recommending crypto ETFs… Now launching their own. Makes sense given Morgan’s massive distribution. Clearly, they were seeing meaningful demand from clients for crypto ETFs. With its extensive client base and distribution network, the bank’s proprietary ETF could accelerate mainstream adoption.

Altcoins followed Bitcoin’s lead, and most traded sideways through the day. Total crypto market cap dropped nearly 3% over the past 24 hours before stabilising near the $3.2T mark as investors began locking in gains. Market sentiment stayed neutral in the meantime, with the crypto fear and greed index at 49 at the time of writing. With no major catalysts to move markets, investors look undecided and appear to be in wait and see mode, especially after what many would view as a Bitcoin fake-out rally that failed to clear $95,000. Markets are also watching an array of US economic data due later this week. Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin price opened near an intraday high of $94,140 and drifted lower through the session as repeated failures to reclaim the $94,500 to $95,000 resistance zone encouraged short-term profit taking. With BTC still up roughly 12% from its December lows near $84,500, many traders appeared inclined to lock in gains rather than press fresh longs ahead of key macro events. Selling pressure picked up noticeably during Asian trading hours, where traders appeared to initiate a fresh round of sell orders once it became clear that momentum was fading at resistance. Adding to the downside, the sell-off triggered widespread long liquidations across the derivatives market. Over the past 24 hours, total crypto market liquidations came in at approximately $449.34 million, with Bitcoin alone accounting for $151.91 million. Longs made up the overwhelming bulk of these liquidations, $362.24 million, versus only $87.10 million in shorts, suggesting that many traders had bet on a breakout that didn’t materialise. As price slipped below short-term support levels, forced long liquidations added to selling pressure and amplified the downside move. Altcoins like Ethereum also contributed to the cascade with over $99 million in total liquidations, while other major names like XRP and DOGE saw $26.8 million and $11.8 million wiped out, respectively. Momentum on the institutional side has also started to cool, with inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs slowing from the strong pace seen at the start of the year. Without that steady stream of fresh capital to absorb selling pressure, the market has struggled to maintain upward traction, particularly near key resistance levels where conviction remains weak. Then on the macro side, traders are also bracing for several high-impact data prints out of the US this week. Key releases include the ADP employment report, JOLTS job openings, and Friday’s nonfarm payrolls, all of which could shape expectations around interest rates and alter risk appetite. For now, the uncertainty seems to have contributed to the “risk-off” tone, as investors are pulling back exposure across risk assets, including crypto. At the same tine, geopolitical tensions, such as fresh scrutiny around US policy on Venezuela’s oil exports, have only added to the caution. Will Bitcoin price go up? Bitcoin has been repeatedly testing the the $91k floor which has been acting as a major support area throughout the day. If Bitcoin price fails to hold above this last line of defence before the $90,000 psychological level, it could spook markets even further and invalidate the entire bullish setup that has been built over the past few days. On the other hand, a recovery back above $92,000, which is the next key support area, could provide a sold ground for attacking the $94,500 ceiling with strong conviction. When consulting the 24-hour Bitcoin liquidation heatmap, a few key patterns emerge that help shed light on near-term price dynamics in both directions. Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. On the downside, the chart reveals dense liquidation clusters just above the $91,000 level, confirming it as a critical support zone that Bitcoin has tested multiple times in the last 24 hours. A breakdown below this threshold could expose the next major band of liquidations forming just above $90,000, a psychologically important round number. If that level fails to hold, the heatmap suggests a pocket of high leverage positions extending down toward $88,000. To the upside, the heatmap indicates persistent liquidation leverage stacked near the $94,000 to $95,000 region, the same resistance band where Bitcoin was repeatedly rejected earlier in the session. The density of liquidation levels in this range suggests that any breakout above $95,000 could trigger a short squeeze, especially if BTC reclaims $94,500 with strong spot volume.

Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, seesawed between the $3,200-$3,300 range through the day before stabilizing around $3,180, down 3.3% over the past day. Other major cryptocurrencies, such as BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), saw losses ranging from 2-5% while XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) were hit harder with losses of 7% each. Even as most of the market traded in the red, a handful of tokens managed to hold their ground. MemeCore (M) and MYX Finance (MYX) held gains of around 2% to 3%, while Tron (TRX) followed with gains of a little over 1%.

In one such instance, a bot t urned an initial balance of $63 into about $131,000 within a month by exploiting volatility and liquidity inefficiencies in Bitcoin ( BTC )-related prediction markets. Polymarket trading bot with ~98% win rate. Source: Polymarket Wallet activity indicates the gains came from automation and execution strategy rather than directional price calls. How the bot executes successful trades The bot enters both sides of a market early, when uncertainty and bid-ask spreads are high, buying both “Yes” and “No” positions and trading rapidly. This effectively turns it into a market maker, capturing small, repeatable profits with limited directional risk. As price direction becomes clearer minutes after launch, the bot abandons the losing side and reallocates capital into the winning outcome. Transaction data shows large, repeated purchases, often in the hundreds of shares, building positions into the thousands as prices continue to rise. At the same time, a major driver of the outsized returns is the accumulation of heavily discounted positions during sharp volatility swings. When one side of a market falls to between $0.01 and $0.03, the bot increases exposure, risking little if prices stay flat but capturing gains of more than 30 times the entry cost when volatility reverses. Data also identified a second automated account using the same strategy, which recovered from about $82 to generate roughly $67,000 in profit in around three weeks. The account showed extreme trading intensity, executing about 524 trades in 10 minutes, consistent with fully automated market-making. Across both accounts, win rates were around 95% to 96%, with profits concentrated during periods of heightened Bitcoin volatility rather than long-term price trends, highlighting how algorithmic strategies are exploiting short-term inefficiencies on prediction markets such as Polymarket. This strategy was also highlighted in a previous Finbold report , which indicated that another trading bot turned $313 into $438,000 on Polymarket within a month.

The move adds to growing expectations that large Wall Street firms are positioning for broader spot crypto products beyond Bitcoin. The filing, submitted on Jan. 6, establishes the legal framework for a statutory trust that would hold ether on behalf of investors. Ethereum ETFs Top $20B as Morgan Stanley Steps In The registration statement stated that Morgan Stanley Investment Management will act as the depositor, while CSC Delaware Trust Company will serve as trustee. The trust was formed on Dec. 16, 2025, under Delaware law, with an initial contribution of $1, a standard procedural step used to create the entity before it begins operations. While the filing does not guarantee approval or immediate launch, it signals intent to offer regulated Ethereum exposure through traditional brokerage channels. As of Jan. 6, Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $1.72 billion in daily value traded and collectively held $20.06 billion in net assets, equivalent to just over 5% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. Ethereum spot ETF market overview Source: Sosovalue BlackRock’s ETHA dominates the sector, holding $11.58 billion in assets and accounting for nearly 3% of ETH’s market cap on its own, with daily trading volume exceeding $1 billion. Other issuers show a more mixed picture with Grayscale’s higher-fee ETHE continues to see persistent outflows, with more than $5 billion leaving the fund over time, while its lower-fee ETH product and Fidelity’s FETH have retained stronger long-term inflows. The data suggests that fee sensitivity and liquidity are playing a growing role in how investors choose Ethereum exposure, a factor Morgan Stanley will likely have to consider if its trust eventually converts into an exchange-traded product. ETH Trust Filing Fits Classic Path to Spot ETFs for Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley’s move follows a familiar pattern seen across major asset managers. Firms such as Grayscale and VanEck began with trusts or futures-based products years before spot ETFs were approved, while BlackRock and Fidelity launched spot Ether ETFs directly in July 2024 after the SEC greenlit the category . The SEC has given the green light to eight spot Ethereum ETFs, including applications from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. #Ethereum #ETF #SEC https://t.co/YXZI7i7i56 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 23, 2024 Against that backdrop, Morgan Stanley’s Ethereum trust filing is widely seen as groundwork rather than an endpoint, similar to how earlier trust products eventually transitioned into exchange-traded funds once regulatory conditions allowed. The timing is notable given Morgan Stanley’s broader crypto push. Just one day earlier, the bank filed an S-1 for a spot Bitcoin Trust designed to track Bitcoin’s price directly. @MorganStanley files an S-1 registration with the @SECGov for a Bitcoin Trust and Solana product. #CryptoAdoption #Bitcoin https://t.co/rOFrtNJUMh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 6, 2026 Morgan Stanley has also filed for a Solana-linked trust and is preparing to roll out direct crypto trading for Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana through its E-Trade platform , pending regulatory approval. Together, these filings suggest a coordinated expansion rather than isolated experiments. Morgan Stanley oversees roughly $8.2 trillion in client assets through its wealth management arm, giving it a strong incentive to internalize crypto exposure as demand grows. Executives have pointed to a more permissive U.S. regulatory environment as a key reason for accelerating its digital asset plans. For traditional investors, products like an Ethereum trust or ETF offer regulated, brokerage-based access to ETH price movements without the complexities of self-custody, staking, or on-chain activity. Unlike spot ETH ownership, trust or ETF investors do not control the underlying asset or receive staking rewards. Despite those limits, steady ETF inflows show institutions still favor simplicity and compliance. While Morgan Stanley has not explicitly announced plans for a spot Ethereum ETF, the trust filing fits neatly into the established playbook that preceded spot launches by other major firms.

According to a pivotal report from Wall Street asset manager Bernstein, the sector is poised for a historic transformation. The firm forecasts a market bottom following a late-2025 correction. Subsequently, a powerful ‘tokenization supercycle’ will catalyze the next major crypto bull run in 2026. This analysis provides a data-driven roadmap for the coming years, highlighting profound implications for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and the broader financial ecosystem. The Tokenization Supercycle: A New Market Paradigm Bernstein’s central thesis hinges on the concept of a ‘tokenization supercycle.’ This term describes a sustained, multi-year period of explosive growth. The growth will stem from converting real-world assets (RWAs) into digital tokens on blockchains. The firm anticipates this boom will permeate three core areas: stablecoins, capital markets, and prediction markets. Consequently, this movement will create a new layer of liquidity and efficiency. Traditional finance has begun experimenting with blockchain. However, Bernstein predicts a full-scale adoption wave will begin in earnest by 2026. This transition mirrors the internet’s evolution from a niche tool to a global infrastructure layer. Tokenization promises to fractionalize ownership, automate compliance, and enable 24/7 trading for assets like bonds, real estate, and private equity. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock and JPMorgan, are already building the foundational rails for this future. Bernstein’s report contextualizes these developments within a clear market cycle framework. Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory and Market Cycle Analysis Bernstein anchors its bullish outlook with specific price projections for Bitcoin. The firm has set a 2026 price target of $150,000. Furthermore, it projects a cycle peak of $200,000 by 2027. These forecasts are not based on speculation. Instead, they integrate models of adoption curves, halving cycle impacts, and the influx of institutional capital via tokenized funds and ETFs. The predicted path involves a market correction in late 2025. This correction will establish a final bottom before the next ascent. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced drawdowns of 70-80% after previous bull market peaks. A similar consolidation would align with past cycles. The subsequent recovery and breakout, however, will be fueled by a fundamentally different driver: tokenization. Bernstein’s Crypto Market Projection Timeline Timeline Key Event Projected Impact Late 2025 Market Correction Forms cycle bottom, shakes out weak leverage 2026 Tokenization Supercycle Acceleration Drives new bull run; Bitcoin target: $150,000 2027 Cycle Peak Bitcoin reaches $200,000; broad RWA adoption Expert Angle: From Speculation to Utility Gautam Chhugani, Senior Analyst at Bernstein, emphasized this shift in a recent commentary. “The narrative is evolving from pure monetary speculation to blockchain utility at scale,” Chhugani stated. “The tokenization of everything—from treasury bills to real estate—creates a tangible use case that attracts traditional capital. This provides the fundamental bedrock for the next cycle.” This perspective underscores a maturation within the crypto asset class. The focus is moving towards efficiency gains and new financial products. Stablecoins: The $420 Billion Liquidity Engine A critical component of Bernstein’s forecast is the explosive growth of the stablecoin market. The report projects the total stablecoin supply will swell to $420 billion in 2026. This figure represents a staggering 56% increase year-over-year. Stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, serve as the primary settlement layer and on-ramp for tokenized markets. This growth is not happening in a vacuum. Regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions like the EU with MiCA and potential US legislation is providing a clearer operating environment. Major players are expanding their offerings: PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Circle’s USDC are integrating with traditional payment rails. Institutional demand for yield-bearing stablecoins is rising. Stablecoins are becoming the default settlement tool for cross-border trade and remittances. This expanding stablecoin base acts as the ‘digital dollars’ needed to fuel trading, lending, and transactions across the tokenized economy Bernstein envisions. Equity Beneficiaries: Crypto-Linked Stocks in Focus The ripple effects of the tokenization supercycle will extend far beyond native crypto assets. Bernstein explicitly identifies publicly traded companies with deep crypto integration as major beneficiaries. The report highlights Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) . These platforms stand to gain from increased trading volumes, custody fees for tokenized assets, and expanded service offerings. Coinbase, for instance, is building a layer-2 blockchain, Base, and positioning itself as a key on-ramp for institutional tokenization projects. Robinhood continues to grow its crypto-active user base. As tokenization brings more users and assets on-chain, these front-end consumer applications capture significant value. Their stock performance may increasingly correlate with the adoption metrics of the underlying tokenization trend. Broader Impacts and Real-World Context The implications of a tokenization-driven bull run are profound. Firstly, it would validate blockchain technology’s utility beyond cryptocurrency trading. Secondly, it could lead to a more integrated financial system where digital and traditional assets coexist on shared ledgers. Central banks are exploring wholesale CBDCs for settlements. Meanwhile, private sector innovation drives retail-facing applications. Potential impacts include: Increased Market Efficiency: Faster settlement and reduced intermediary costs. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Fractional ownership opens high-value assets to smaller investors. New Regulatory Challenges: Authorities will need to adapt frameworks for a tokenized world. This transition will not be without volatility or setbacks. However, the directional trend identified by Bernstein is supported by significant capital and developer momentum. Conclusion Bernstein’s analysis presents a compelling, evidence-based narrative for the future of digital assets. The predicted tokenization supercycle offers a fundamental driver for the next crypto bull run, expected to peak in 2026-2027. With Bitcoin price targets of $150,000 and $200,000, alongside a projected $420 billion stablecoin market, the scale of this transition is substantial. While market cycles will always include corrections, the underlying trend toward blockchain utility through tokenization appears robust. This shift promises to reshape not just cryptocurrency markets but the architecture of global finance itself. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘tokenization supercycle’? A tokenization supercycle refers to a prolonged, multi-year period where the conversion of real-world assets (like bonds, real estate, or funds) into digital tokens on a blockchain sees massive, accelerated adoption. This drives new capital, utility, and growth into the crypto ecosystem. Q2: Why does Bernstein predict a market bottom in late 2025? The prediction is based on historical Bitcoin market cycle analysis, which typically shows deep corrections (70-80%) after bull market peaks. A late-2025 bottom would align with these past cycles, shaking out excess leverage and setting the stage for a new uptrend driven by fundamental adoption. Q3: How does stablecoin growth relate to tokenization? Stablecoins are the primary medium of exchange and settlement within crypto markets. As more real-world assets are tokenized and traded on-chain, the demand for stable, dollar-pegged digital currencies to facilitate those transactions increases dramatically, hence the projection of $420 billion in supply. Q4: Which companies benefit most from this trend? According to Bernstein, crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase and Robinhood are major beneficiaries. They provide trading, custody, and on-ramp services that see increased demand as tokenization brings more users and institutional capital into the space. Q5: Is this prediction guaranteed to happen? No financial prediction is guaranteed. Bernstein’s forecast is a research-based projection considering current adoption trends, regulatory developments, and technological progress. It remains subject to risks like severe regulatory crackdowns, macroeconomic downturns, or critical technological failures.

Capital shifts first, narratives follow, and confirmation arrives when mainstream finance begins to speak openly about the change. That moment now appears to be unfolding. As Bitcoin consolidates and Ethereum matures, investors are increasingly searching for assets that combine real-world utility with stronger percentage upside. XRP is rapidly emerging as a focal point of that search. The shift gained wider attention after crypto analyst Paul Barron shared a CNBC Power Lunch segment that captured how institutional investors and market strategists are reassessing XRP’s role. The conversation did not frame XRP as a speculative outlier. Instead, it positioned the asset as a leading beneficiary of changing market structure and investor behavior. Things are about to get seriously locked in $XRP pic.twitter.com/LEJea9ftRa — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) January 7, 2026 XRP Takes Center Stage on Wall Street CNBC anchor Brian Sullivan opened the segment with a striking assessment, stating, “The hottest crypto trade of the year is not Bitcoin, it is not Ether, it is XRP.” He noted that XRP has climbed more than 20% this year, become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and attracted “big money” interest. That framing matters because it reflects performance-driven capital rotation rather than retail hype. XRP’s strength has emerged during a period when Bitcoin has traded in consolidation, signaling a deliberate shift rather than a momentum chase. Investor Behavior Signals Conviction CNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos explained that XRP accumulation intensified during the quieter conditions of Q4. She noted that investors “were buying the dip with XRP,” especially through XRP-related exchange-traded products. Unlike Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, which often move in tandem with price, XRP inflows increased during market weakness. Sigalos added that XRP represents “a less crowded trade than Bitcoin or Ether,” a dynamic that proved accurate in the first trading days of January. That pattern suggests investors positioned early for asymmetric upside rather than reacting late to price acceleration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Utility, Speed, and the Institutional Lens When asked about XRP’s core use case, Sigalos emphasized that XRP “made its name in terms of cross-border payments,” a foundation that continues to resonate as institutions prioritize speed and cost efficiency. The segment repeatedly highlighted that transaction speed and low fees increasingly define blockchain adoption. Sullivan reinforced this point, noting that faster and cheaper networks now drive real-world usage. Sigalos agreed, stating plainly, “That’s exactly it,” while explaining that institutions now deploy assets across multiple blockchains based on efficiency rather than loyalty to legacy networks. A Clear Sign of Market Evolution The discussion closed on a broader observation about market change. Sigalos stated, “I think absolutely we’re seeing times change,” pointing to tokenized equities, institutional blockchain adoption, and exchange diversification as signs of a maturing digital asset economy. Taken together, the segment framed XRP not as a temporary rotation but as part of a structural shift. As capital prioritizes efficiency, scalability, and utility, XRP appears increasingly locked into the next phase of crypto market evolution.

Top assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as speculative tokens such as Dogecoin, have posted even sharper gains, according to a report by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan. For the 2026 rally to continue, the market needs to cross three hurdles. Factors Influencing 2026 Outlook In a market outlook published this week, Hougan said the rally could extend further this year if three key conditions are met. The first hurdle was the lingering fallout from October 10, 2025, when crypto assets suffered the largest liquidation event on record and wiped out almost $19 billion in futures positions in a single day. Following that event, concerns emerged that major market makers or hedge funds may have been severely damaged, potentially forcing them to wind down operations and sell assets, a scenario that typically weighs on prices. Hougan said these fears contributed to crypto’s inability to rally in the fourth quarter, as the possibility of forced selling “hung over the market like a heavy fog.” However, he noted that if such wind-downs were going to occur, they would most likely have taken place by the end of the year. As such, the absence of visible fallout into early 2026 means that investors have put the October event behind them. The Bitwise exec said that two hurdles remain. The second centers on regulation, specifically the crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act, which is currently moving through Congress. The Senate is targeting January 15 for markup, a process that involves aligning drafts in the Senate banking and agriculture committees before pushing the final bill toward a vote. Hougan said challenges such as differing views on how to regulate decentralized finance, stablecoin rewards, and issues around political conflicts of interest persist, but added that clearing the markup stage would represent a major step forward. He stated that passage of the bill is critical for the long-term future of crypto in the United States, as it would “enshrine” core regulatory principles into law and reduce the risk that the current pro-crypto stance at agencies such as the SEC and CFTC could reverse under a future administration. White House crypto czar David Sacks has said the industry is “closer than ever” to passing the bill. Meanwhile, prediction market Kalshi places the odds at 46% by May and 82% by year’s end, which Hougan characterized as a reason for cautious optimism. The third hurdle involves the broader equity market, which the exec said does not need to be in a raging bull phase for crypto to perform well. But it must avoid a sharp decline, such as a 20% pullback in the S&P 500, that could hurt all risk assets in the short term. He noted that prediction markets currently see a low probability of a recession in 2026 and roughly an 80% chance of gains for the S&P 500. Rocky Months Ahead? Despite Hougan’s hopeful outlook, some industry experts feel a little differently on BTC’s near- to medium-term trajectory. Pseudonymous analyst Doctor Profit has repeatedly said Bitcoin is still in a bear market that began in September and has not completed its bottoming process. While he expects no major crash in early 2026 and sees room for a short-term rally toward the $97,000-$107,000 range, the analyst asserted that he remains fully bearish on BTC overall and continues to target prices below $70,000 in the coming months.

According to Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, Bitcoin (BTC) will likely retest its yearly opening price of $87,500. This analysis, reported by Cointelegraph, arrives during a period of significant volatility and provides a data-driven framework for understanding current market mechanics. The forecast hinges on the interplay between large-scale investor behavior and key technical indicators, offering a neutral examination of potential near-term trajectories for the world’s leading digital asset. Bitcoin Price Prediction and the $87.5K Level Keith Alan’s analysis centers on Bitcoin’s yearly opening price, a psychologically and technically significant benchmark for institutional and retail traders. The $87,500 level represents the starting point for Bitcoin’s 2025 trading year, and a retest involves the price moving back down to challenge that level as support. Alan observes that while attempts are being made to defend the higher $92,000 support zone, substantial investors are positioning to test lower thresholds. This dynamic creates a tension between immediate support and the gravitational pull toward the yearly open. Consequently, market participants are scrutinizing order book data and on-chain metrics for confirmation of this potential move. Technical analysts often view a retest of a major opening level as a healthy consolidation phase within a broader trend. It allows the market to gather liquidity and establish a stronger foundation for future price movements. For Bitcoin, which has experienced parabolic rallies and sharp corrections throughout its history, such retests are not uncommon. Historical data shows that similar retests of yearly opens have preceded both extended bull runs and prolonged bear markets, depending on the macroeconomic context. Therefore, understanding the conditions surrounding this specific prediction requires examining multiple timeframes and investor cohorts. Technical Indicators and Conflicting Signals The current technical landscape for Bitcoin presents a mosaic of conflicting signals across different time horizons. Keith Alan notes the possibility of a bullish “golden cross” forming on the daily chart, where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one. However, he immediately tempers this optimism by stating that short signals are prevailing on medium and long-term timeframes. This divergence is crucial for traders, as it suggests near-term bullish potential may be overshadowed by stronger bearish pressure on weekly and monthly charts. Such multi-timeframe analysis helps avoid the pitfall of relying on a single indicator. For a genuine and sustained price rebound to occur, Alan outlines two specific technical prerequisites. First, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) would need to climb above 41 out of 100. The RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, and a reading below 50 typically indicates bearish momentum. Secondly, the weekly closing price must reclaim a position above the 50-week moving average, which currently sits near $101,500. These are not arbitrary levels but are derived from historical performance and are widely monitored by algorithmic trading systems. The gap between current prices and these thresholds illustrates the significant work required for the market structure to turn decisively bullish. Understanding Market Structure and Large Investor Behavior The behavior of large-scale investors, often called “whales,” is a central component of this analysis. Material Indicators specializes in parsing order book data to identify the intentions of these major market participants. When these entities look to “test lower support,” they are often executing strategies that involve placing large buy orders at specific price levels or allowing the price to fall to accumulate assets more cheaply. Their actions can create cascading effects, triggering stop-loss orders and influencing sentiment among smaller traders. This creates a feedback loop where technical levels become self-fulfilling prophecies due to collective market focus. Furthermore, the defense of the $92,000 level indicates where concentrated buying interest currently resides. If this defense fails, the path toward $87,500 becomes more probable. Market structure analysis in 2025 increasingly incorporates on-chain data, such as exchange net flows and illiquid supply changes, alongside traditional order book analysis. This holistic approach provides a more robust picture than price charts alone. For instance, a retest of $87,500 accompanied by a significant movement of Bitcoin off exchanges and into long-term storage wallets would be interpreted very differently than a retest driven by panic selling onto exchanges. The Macro Context for Cryptocurrency in 2025 Any Bitcoin price prediction does not exist in a vacuum. The broader financial ecosystem in 2025 exerts considerable influence. Key factors include: Global Monetary Policy: Interest rate decisions by major central banks like the Federal Reserve directly impact liquidity and risk appetite. Regulatory Developments: Clarity or uncertainty regarding digital asset regulations in the US, EU, and Asia can catalyze or suppress institutional investment. Traditional Market Correlation: Bitcoin’s sometimes-strengthening, sometimes-weakening correlation with equity indices like the S&P 500 affects portfolio allocation decisions. Technological Adoption: Progress in layer-2 scaling solutions, institutional custody, and real-world asset tokenization underpins long-term network value. Analysts like Keith Alan must weigh these macro forces against micro, chart-based signals. A technically driven retest to $87,500 could be accelerated or mitigated by a sudden macro event. Therefore, while technical analysis provides a framework for probability, it operates alongside fundamental and on-chain analysis in modern crypto market evaluation. The most respected analysts in the space consistently integrate all three disciplines to form a complete view. Historical Precedents and Price Cycle Analysis Bitcoin’s market cycles have exhibited recurring, though not identical, patterns. Retesting major support levels after a significant rally is a common theme. For example, in previous bull markets, Bitcoin has often revisited its 20-week or 50-week moving average before continuing its upward trajectory. The key differentiator between a healthy correction and a trend reversal lies in how the asset reacts at that support. Does it bounce decisively with high volume, or does it break through and consolidate below? Historical precedent suggests that a orderly retest of the yearly open, followed by a strong rebound, can actually reinforce bullish sentiment by shaking out weak hands and demonstrating resilient demand. The following table contrasts potential outcomes based on how Bitcoin interacts with the $87,500 level: Scenario Price Action Likely Market Interpretation Strong Rejection Price touches ~$87.5K and rallies sharply on high volume. Confirmation of robust support, potential launchpad for next leg up. Weak Consolidation Price breaks below $87.5K and struggles to reclaim it. Sign of weakening structure, could lead to test of lower supports. Sideways Accumulation Price oscillates around $87.5K for an extended period with low volatility. Period of investor indecision and accumulation by long-term holders. Conclusion The Bitcoin price prediction for a retest of $87,500, as outlined by analyst Keith Alan, provides a clear technical scenario for market participants to monitor. This analysis is grounded in observable order book dynamics, multi-timeframe technical indicators, and the behavior of large-scale investors. While the potential for a golden cross on daily charts offers a near-term bullish counterpoint, the prevailing short signals on higher timeframes and the specific weekly RSI and moving average hurdles suggest caution. Ultimately, the market’s reaction at this key yearly open level will offer critical evidence about the underlying strength of the current trend and set the tone for Bitcoin’s performance in the latter half of 2025. Investors and traders are advised to consider this technical framework alongside ongoing macro developments and on-chain data trends. FAQs Q1: What does it mean for Bitcoin to “retest” a price level? A retest occurs when an asset’s price returns to a previously established level of support or resistance to test its strength. If the level holds as support, price often bounces higher. If it breaks, the price may move lower to find new support. Q2: What is a “golden cross” in technical analysis? A golden cross is a bullish chart pattern where a short-term moving average (like the 50-day) crosses above a long-term moving average (like the 200-day). It is traditionally interpreted as a signal that a bullish trend may be beginning. Q3: Why is the weekly RSI level of 41 significant in this analysis? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures momentum. A weekly RSI below 50 generally indicates bearish momentum. Surpassing 41 would signal a meaningful shift toward strengthening momentum, which is cited as a necessary condition for a sustained rebound. Q4: How do large-scale investors influence Bitcoin’s price at support levels? Large investors can place substantial buy orders at specific support levels, creating a concentration of demand that can halt a price decline. Their activity is visible in order book depth and can trigger algorithmic trading responses across the market. Q5: Is a retest of the yearly opening price necessarily a bearish event? Not necessarily. In the context of a long-term uptrend, a retest of a major support level like the yearly open can be a healthy consolidation. It allows the market to reset overbought conditions and build a stronger base for the next advance, depending on how it holds.

Rumble and Tether seek to empower users and creators amid broader crypto adoption, the companies said in a press release . According to details, Rumble Wallet will offer a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that the community can tap into to manage and transfer digital assets directly. Users will not rely on centralized custodians, banks, or payment processors. Wallet to support Bitcoin, USDT At launch, Rumble Wallet is set to support Tether’s stablecoin USDT and tokenized gold asset Tether Gold (XAUT). The wallet will also support Bitcoin (BTC), the benchmark cryptocurrency, with plans to expand this to more assets. “Rumble represents free speech and liberty the same way that cryptocurrency and a decentralized internet represent freedom, and Rumble Wallet is the natural combination of those things,” said Rumble founder and chief executive officer Chris Pavlovski. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, added: “We champion technologies that promote freedom, decentralization, and the fundamental right to free speech. Rumble Wallet gives tens of millions of users more control than any platform has offered before.” Rumble Wallet launches on the back of broader collaboration between Tether and Rumble, with both companies eyeing BTC and stablecoin adoption. The partnership was first announced in October at the Plan B Forum in Lugano. Developers from both firms envisioned a wallet for crypto-native monetization, a move key to addressing potential debanking. Rumble Wallet will be powered by Tether’s open-source Wallet Development Kit (WDK), and will boast enhanced security, privacy, and cross-chain interoperability. Millions of users on Rumble can use this wallet for creator tips with crypto. “We are putting more power into the hands of users and creators so they can engage with and financially support the content they like. That’s another parallel to free expression, and it’s all unique to Rumble,” Pavlovski added. Tether’s expansion continues This partnership adds to Tether’s aggressive expansion and diversification beyond its core stablecoin operations. USDT, with a market capitalisation of over $186 billion, remains the company’s flagship product. The firm has increasingly positioned itself beyond its role as the dominant issuer in the stablecoin market, with recent initiatives underscoring broader strategic ambitions. Tether has accumulated significant profits in recent years and now holds a sizable Bitcoin position, alongside investments spanning multiple sectors and geographies. These include exposure to energy, infrastructure, and financial technology, reflecting a more diversified balance sheet strategy. Beyond its core stablecoin and payments business, Tether has signalled interest in areas such as artificial intelligence datasets, wider blockchain adoption, and trading-related infrastructure. The company has also stepped up its involvement in decentralized finance, where it is seeking greater traction as part of its longer-term expansion plans. Earlier this week, Tether introduced Scudo, a unit of account designed for XAUT. One Scudo measures as one thousandth of a troy ounce of gold, and its use will allow for “clearer pricing, easier transfers, and more intuitive use of gold-backed value,” amid increased use of the precious metal. Gold prices soared in 2025 as global interest skyrocketed.

Of the $4.96 million in early Tuesday afternoon liquidations, roughly $4.92 million came from longs while shorts lost around $42,000 as traders chased a continuation. Dogecoin 4-hour liquidations. Source: Coinglass . The meme coin dipped to around $0.1495 before rebounding above $0.15, a move that tempted traders to pile into leveraged longs expecting a stronger continuation. When the price stalled instead of breaking higher, those overextended positions were quickly flushed out. This leverage reset cleared excess speculation from the market and may now open the door for spot buyers and stronger hands to regain control. Despite the volatility, bulls managed to defend the $0.15 level, while bears failed to push DOGE back below the $0.145 zone. The setup shows early-stage similarities to the structure seen last market cycle. In the build-up to the 2021 bull run, a leverage flush marked the end of prolonged consolidation before momentum returned and price entered a broader trend continuation phase.

The RSI has broken into bullish territory, peaking at 65, a level unseen since September. The MACD reads much the same, building a wide lead above the signal line after months of weak movement. The key breakout threshold sits around $0.225, with interim support around $0.185 as the immediate level to watch for a rejection. A clean triangle breakout sets up a measured move of roughly 310% to past highs around $0.50 , and a fully realised target of $1 for a potoentail 710% gain .

It combines Bitcoin’s security with the speed and low fees of Solana, making everyday things like payments, trading, and apps faster and cheaper. All while staying connected to Bitcoin. In simple terms, whatever Solana can do, Bitcoin will soon be able to do too . The project has already raised over $30 million, and once it launches, even a small slice of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could push $HYPER much higher.

Renan Santos Champions a National Bitcoin Reserve Renan Santos, a prominent figure in Brazil’s upcoming presidential race, has formally proposed that the nation should begin accumulating Bitcoin as part of its sovereign assets. Consequently, this proposal marks one of the most direct calls for state-level cryptocurrency adoption by a major political candidate in a G20 economy. Santos specifically cited the precedent set by El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, whose country adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Moreover, Santos described the policy as “already being feasible” and suggested a pragmatic, gradual approach for Brazil to build its holdings. He emphasized that blockchain technology, the underlying system for Bitcoin, could also serve as a powerful tool for increasing transparency and reducing public sector corruption. The Global Precedent of Sovereign Bitcoin Adoption The concept of a national cryptocurrency reserve is no longer theoretical. El Salvador provides the primary real-world case study. The Central American nation began purchasing Bitcoin in September 2021, treating it as a strategic treasury asset. While the initiative faced significant volatility and international scrutiny, the Salvadoran government has consistently reported paper profits during bull markets, framing it as a long-term economic diversification strategy. Furthermore, other nations have explored similar concepts. For instance, the Central African Republic briefly adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2022, though the move faced implementation challenges. Additionally, countries like Ukraine and Panama have passed legislation to regulate and integrate digital assets, signaling a broader global trend toward state-level engagement with cryptocurrency markets. Economic Rationale and Strategic Considerations Proponents of a national Bitcoin reserve often cite several potential economic benefits. Firstly, Bitcoin is perceived by some as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, similar to digital gold. For a country like Brazil, which has experienced historical bouts of high inflation, this characteristic holds particular appeal. Secondly, holding Bitcoin could diversify national reserves away from traditional assets like the US dollar or gold. Thirdly, early adoption could position Brazil as a leader in financial technology within Latin America, potentially attracting investment and talent. However, economists and financial analysts universally highlight the extreme volatility of Bitcoin as the paramount risk. The value of a national reserve could swing dramatically, posing challenges for fiscal planning and stability. Therefore, Santos’s suggestion of a gradual accumulation aims to mitigate this risk through dollar-cost averaging, a common investment strategy. Blockchain as a Tool Against Corruption Beyond the reserve proposal, Santos pointed to blockchain’s potential for governance reform. Blockchain technology creates an immutable, transparent, and publicly verifiable ledger. In theory, applying this to public records, procurement processes, or fund disbursements could reduce opportunities for fraud and misappropriation. For example: Transparent Procurement: Government contracts and bids recorded on a blockchain could be audited by anyone, increasing accountability. Secure Land Registries: Property titles stored on a blockchain could help prevent fraud and streamline transactions. Direct Benefit Transfer: Social welfare payments using digital currencies on a transparent ledger could ensure funds reach intended recipients. Several pilot projects worldwide, from Georgia’s land registry to Dubai’s government systems, have explored these applications with varying degrees of success. The technical and logistical hurdles for implementing such systems at a national scale, however, remain substantial. Political and Regulatory Landscape in Brazil Brazil has already taken measured steps toward regulating the digital asset space. In December 2022, the Brazilian Congress passed Law 14,478, establishing a comprehensive legal framework for virtual asset service providers. The law defined cryptocurrencies and placed oversight under the country’s central bank and securities regulator. This regulatory clarity has fostered a growing crypto industry within the country. Santos’s proposal, however, would represent a quantum leap from regulating private activity to active state participation. The political reception is likely to be mixed. Advocates may frame it as innovative and forward-thinking, while opponents could criticize it as reckless speculation with public funds. The debate will inevitably center on risk tolerance, monetary sovereignty, and the role of the state in emerging technological frontiers. Expert Perspectives on the Proposal Financial experts offer a spectrum of views on the viability of a Brazilian Bitcoin reserve. “The proposal is politically symbolic and taps into a growing digital nationalist sentiment,” notes Dr. Elena Silva, a Latin American political economist at the University of São Paulo. “However, the operational and risk-management details are far more complex than the political rhetoric suggests.” Meanwhile, blockchain analysts highlight the infrastructure challenge. “For a reserve to be secure and liquid, Brazil would need to develop unparalleled custody solutions and establish clear protocols for auditing and transacting the asset,” states Marcos Oliveira, a São Paulo-based crypto analyst. These expert insights underscore that the path from proposal to practice would require extensive planning, bipartisan support, and robust technical safeguards. Conclusion The call by presidential candidate Renan Santos for a national Bitcoin reserve places Brazil at the forefront of a global conversation about the future of state assets and financial technology. While inspired by El Salvador’s bold experiment, the Brazilian context—with its larger, more complex economy—presents unique challenges and opportunities. The dual focus on both a strategic financial reserve and the anti-corruption potential of blockchain technology reflects a multifaceted approach to digital asset integration. As the 2025 election cycle progresses, this proposal will likely catalyze deeper discussion on monetary policy, technological sovereignty, and innovative approaches to long-standing economic and governance issues in Latin America’s largest economy. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a national Bitcoin reserve? A national Bitcoin reserve is a proposed strategy where a country’s government or central bank purchases and holds Bitcoin as part of its official sovereign asset portfolio, similar to how nations hold gold or foreign currency reserves. Q2: Why did Renan Santos cite El Salvador as an example? Santos cited El Salvador because it became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and to begin actively purchasing it for its national treasury, providing a real-world, albeit controversial, precedent for state-level Bitcoin accumulation. Q3: How could blockchain technology reduce corruption in Brazil? Blockchain creates a transparent and unchangeable record of transactions. Applying this to government processes like contracting, fund allocation, or property registration could make malfeasance more difficult to hide and easier to audit. Q4: What are the biggest risks of a country holding Bitcoin? The primary risk is extreme price volatility. The value of the reserve could plummet, causing significant losses to the national treasury. Other risks include cybersecurity threats, custody challenges, and potential international regulatory backlash. Q5: Has Brazil already regulated cryptocurrencies? Yes. In late 2022, Brazil passed a comprehensive law (Law 14,478) that provides a legal framework for virtual assets and places oversight under the Central Bank of Brazil and the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM), creating a regulated environment for crypto businesses.

The chairman of the notorious Prince Group now faces repatriation to China, accused of orchestrating forced labor compounds that stole billions in digital assets. This development follows a massive U.S. seizure of over 127,000 Bitcoin linked to his operations, highlighting the unprecedented scale of this modern financial fraud. Chen Zhi Arrested: Unraveling a Transnational Crypto Empire Authorities detained Chen Zhi in Cambodia following a lengthy international investigation. Subsequently, local media confirmed his repatriation to China. Consequently, this action represents a critical moment in the fight against crypto-enabled organized crime. Moreover, the U.S. and UK governments have formally designated his organization, Prince Group, as a transnational criminal entity. Therefore, this arrest signals a new phase of coordinated global enforcement. Investigators allege Chen Zhi oversaw a vast network of scam compounds. These facilities, often disguised as legitimate tech parks, systematically defrauded victims worldwide. Furthermore, operatives used sophisticated social engineering tactics, known as “pig butchering,” to build trust before financially slaughtering targets. The operation’s complexity required collaboration across multiple jurisdictions, demonstrating the evolving challenge of policing decentralized finance. The Mechanics of a Pig Butchering Scam Operation This specific fraud model, termed “Sha Zhu Pan” or pig butchering, follows a meticulous psychological playbook. Initially, scammers contact victims through dating apps, social media, or messaging platforms. They then cultivate romantic or friendly relationships over weeks or months, a process known as “fattening the pig.” Finally, they introduce fraudulent cryptocurrency investment platforms, urging victims to transfer funds. Initial Contact: Scammers use fake profiles to initiate conversation. Trust Building: They engage in daily chats to create emotional bonds. Financial Grooming: They casually discuss lucrative crypto “opportunities.” The Trap: Victims are directed to controlled trading platforms showing fake profits. The Slaughter: After large deposits, funds become irrecoverable, and scammers vanish. Prince Group’s alleged innovation was industrializing this process through forced labor. Reports indicate the group trafficked thousands, often from other Southeast Asian countries, and forced them to run these scams under brutal conditions. This hybrid model combined cyber fraud with human rights abuses on a staggering scale. Expert Analysis: The Systemic Risk of Forced Labor Scam Hubs Financial crime analysts note this case exposes a dangerous convergence of threats. “We are witnessing the professionalization of cyber-scamming,” explains Dr. Anya Petrova, a senior researcher at the Global Financial Integrity Network. “Criminal organizations are no longer just loose collectives; they operate like multinational corporations, with HR departments, performance quotas, and complex money laundering divisions. The use of forced labor creates a high-volume, low-cost fraud factory, but it also introduces severe physical security risks and complicates international legal responses.” This systemic operation allowed Prince Group to target victims globally with high efficiency. Meanwhile, the use of cryptocurrency provided a perceived layer of anonymity for moving funds. However, the immutable nature of blockchain transactions ultimately created a forensic trail for investigators. The $15 Billion Bitcoin Seizure and International Response Prior to Chen Zhi’s arrest, U.S. authorities executed one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in history. They confiscated 127,271 Bitcoin, then valued at approximately $15 billion, linked directly to Prince Group’s operations. This action demonstrated the growing capability of law enforcement to trace and recover digital assets, even through complex obfuscation techniques like chain-hopping and mixing services. The international response has been markedly unified. The table below outlines key actions by global entities: Entity Action Date/Period U.S. Department of Justice Asset seizure (127,271 BTC) 2024 U.K. National Crime Agency Transnational criminal organization designation 2024 Cambodian National Police Arrest and repatriation of Chen Zhi March 2025 INTERPOL Financial Crime Unit Coordinated intelligence sharing on scam compounds Ongoing This coordinated pressure likely contributed to the operational collapse leading to Chen Zhi’s capture. Additionally, increased scrutiny from regional bodies like ASEAN has pushed member states to crack down on scam compounds within their borders. The Human Cost: Inside the Forced Labor Compounds Beyond the financial theft, the human impact of these operations is profound. Survivor testimonies and NGO reports describe compounds resembling prisons. Workers, often lured by fake job ads for customer service roles, have their passports confiscated upon arrival. They then face grueling quotas, working 12-hour shifts to message potential victims. Failure to meet targets results in physical punishment, torture, or being sold to other syndicates. International bodies estimate tens of thousands remain trapped in similar compounds across Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. The Chen Zhi case has intensified diplomatic efforts to dismantle these hubs and repatriate victims. However, the challenge remains immense due to corruption, weak local law enforcement, and the sheer profitability of the scams for criminal networks. The Future of Crypto Scam Enforcement Post-Arrest Chen Zhi’s arrest is a tactical victory, but the strategic war continues. Experts warn the scam infrastructure is decentralized; removing one leader may cause fragmentation, not elimination. “These networks are adaptive,” notes cybersecurity firm analyst, Mark Thorne. “They will migrate, rebrand, and adopt new tactics. The long-term solution requires a multi-pronged approach: continued aggressive asset recovery, hardening of crypto exchange KYC/AML protocols, widespread public education on scam tactics, and sustained pressure on jurisdictions that harbor these operations.” For the cryptocurrency industry, this case is a double-edged sword. It showcases blockchain’s traceability as a law enforcement tool but also reinforces its association with high-profile crime in the public eye. Industry groups are now advocating for clearer regulatory frameworks to separate legitimate innovation from criminal abuse. Conclusion The arrest of Chen Zhi in Cambodia represents a pivotal moment in confronting the industrialized fraud of pig butchering crypto scams. It underscores the critical need for persistent international cooperation to tackle financial crime that exploits both digital currencies and vulnerable populations. While the seizure of $15 billion in Bitcoin and the capture of a key figure are substantial wins, they also reveal the vast scale and human tragedy of these operations. The global community must now build on this momentum, enhancing regulatory frameworks and victim support, to prevent such syndicates from simply evolving and resurfacing elsewhere. The case of Chen Zhi arrested serves as a stark reminder of the dark intersection between technology, greed, and organized crime. FAQs Q1: What is a “pig butchering” crypto scam? A pig butchering scam is a long-term financial fraud where scammers build trust with a victim (“fattening the pig”) before convincing them to invest in a fake cryptocurrency platform, after which the funds are stolen (“the slaughter”). Q2: Why was Chen Zhi arrested in Cambodia? Cambodian authorities, likely acting on international warrants and intelligence, arrested Chen Zhi for his alleged role as the leader of Prince Group, which operated forced labor scam compounds within Cambodia and defrauded victims globally of billions in cryptocurrency. Q3: How was the U.S. able to seize Bitcoin linked to Chen Zhi? U.S. authorities, through blockchain analysis and traditional financial investigation, traced the movement of stolen funds to wallets they could link to Chen Zhi’s operations, allowing them to obtain seizure warrants for those specific digital assets. Q4: What happens to the seized Bitcoin now? The seized Bitcoin will be held by the U.S. government as evidence and for eventual forfeiture. It may later be auctioned, converted to fiat currency, or held in treasury, with potential for restitution to identified victims. Q5: Does this arrest mean pig butchering scams will stop? No. While a major blow, the arrest of one leader is unlikely to stop the entire global industry. The scam model is highly replicable, and other groups will continue operations. The arrest may disrupt one network but highlights the need for ongoing vigilance and education.

Capital flows shift quietly, institutional interest builds, and mainstream financial media begins to repeat a consistent message. As investors position for the next crypto cycle, that pattern is becoming increasingly visible. XRP now stands at the center of a narrative that extends well beyond short-term price action. That narrative gained broader exposure after Altcoin Daily shared a CNBC segment titled “Breakout Crypto Trade for 2026.” The segment presented XRP as a structurally distinct asset whose recent performance reflects deeper market forces rather than speculative momentum. CNBC is desperate for you to buy XRP. ""Money is moving into $XRP for three big reasons."" pic.twitter.com/AaLG7CgSlK — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) January 7, 2026 CNBC Identifies XRP as the Breakout Trade During the segment, CNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos made a direct assessment, stating, “The breakout trade of the 2026 crypto rally isn’t Bitcoin or Ether, it is XRP.” She explained that XRP has risen more than 20% recently, pushed past Binance’s BNB, and secured its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Sigalos also noted that XRP has acted as a “quiet outperformer for months,” holding up even when the broader crypto market pulled back. That resilience has strengthened investor confidence and sustained capital inflows. XRP’s Payments Utility Drives Its Appeal CNBC’s analysis emphasized XRP’s core use case. Sigalos stated, “The use case here is payment, specifically cross-border settlement,” highlighting that Ripple designed XRP as a bridge asset . She explained that when banks or payment providers move value between currencies, “XRP can fit in the middle and help settle that transfer in seconds instead of days.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 She contrasted XRP’s design with Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative and clarified its distinction from stablecoins. “Unlike stablecoins, which are basically tokenized dollars, XRP is trying to be the exchange layer that moves value between currencies,” Sigalos said. Regulatory Clarity Removes a Major Barrier Regulatory resolution emerged as a key catalyst behind XRP’s renewed interest. Sigalos confirmed that “the regulatory overhang has finally cleared,” noting that Ripple fully concluded its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in August 2025. That outcome removed years of uncertainty that had constrained institutional exposure. Capital Flows Confirm Investor Conviction Sigalos pointed to two additional factors driving inflows. She described XRP as “a less crowded trade than Bitcoin or Ether,” which increases its appeal for investors seeking stronger percentage gains. She also observed that XRP-focused funds continued to attract capital during the Q4 market dip, even as Bitcoin ETF flows declined alongside falling prices. Together, these factors explain why CNBC now frames XRP as a leading candidate for the next phase of the crypto market. As regulatory clarity, utility , and capital flows converge, XRP appears increasingly positioned for sustained institutional relevance heading into 2026.

Fleet Mining Beginner’s Guide,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-is-bitcoin-cloud-mining-sign-up-and-receive-a-100-bonus-fleet-mining-beginners-guide/,cryptopolitan,"It is commonly known that the first decentralized digital currency was Bitcoin and it is the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its non-price and transparent network have turned it into a long-term target of the investors across the world. Due to the increasing popularity of Bitcoin mining , the manner in which people engage in Bitcoin mining has also changed, being less efficient and technologically oriented to more effective models. Conventional Bitcoin Mining: Expanding Problems The mining of Bitcoins is a proof-of-work system which consumes considerable computing resources. The initial mining could be performed with the help of simple equipment, but now, it requires special equipment, excessive energy expenditures, air conditioning, and technical control.

In an environment where traditional financial systems are shaped by state power and cross-border capital controls, BTC’s decentralized design is drawing renewed attention as a form of monetary insurance in an increasingly unstable world. Bitcoin’s Performance During Periods Of Instability The geopolitical tension may boost Bitcoin. Walter Bloomberg has noted on X that BTC’s recent rebound suggests rising geopolitical tensions are increasingly pushing investors toward cryptocurrencies. Walter made reference to 21Shares strategist Matt Mena’s statement, who stated that BTC is gaining recognition as a neutral reserve asset, alongside traditional safe havens such as gold and silver. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Is Being Absorbed By Powerful Financial Players — What This Means After falling more than 6% last year, BTC has historically avoided back-to-back annual declines, supporting the case for gains this year. BTC was last down 0.3% at $93,740, after reaching a seven-week high of $94,725 on Monday, underscoring its resilience amid heightened global uncertainty. Considering most of the world is ecstatic with 8% annual returns, an analyst known as Juicy pointed out that the idea of doubling your money in one or two years is already an exceptional outcome for most average people. The hard truth is that most people will never hold their BTC long enough before they cash out 3 to 5 times their money, especially when BTC is down 50% in a bear market, because most people are emotionally attached to their money. Generational wealth with BTC is made by holding through multiple 50% bear market drawdowns across decades. The expert stated that his strategy is never to fully sell BTC, but to sell small portions at basic milestones like $250,000, $500,000, and $1 million, or even $10 million, while the main stack will not be sold. Extreme Supply And The Shift In Spot Momentum A trader known as DD highlighted that BTC traded directly into extreme supply just below Monday’s high and was aggressively rejected from there. This move was followed by a sharp push lower and was driven by heavy spot selling, confirming that this area remains a significant supply zone rather than a breakout point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data DD recalled the weak weekly low, a level that has now been cleared. The market is now in a phase where the response matters more than a continuation. If the price begins to form local accumulation inside demand, that would present an opportunity to look for long exposure. On the other hand, if BTC bounces back into supply and shows clear signs of weakness, then the short setup will also remain valid. Structurally, losing the $91,000 level will open the door towards the weak monthly low around $87,800, which stands out as the next downside level.

He was taken in along with two other associates of his and quickly extradited to China following a request from the Chinese authorities. Following his arrest, Chen Zhi was handed over to Chinese authorities, in what is being described as a collaborative effort between Cambodian and Chinese law enforcement agencies. It is currently unknown what charges Chinese authorities will have him face, but many are watching to see the outcome. Prince Group founder will face investigation upon his return to China Chinese authorities have been looking into Prince Group-related activities since at least 2020. Zhi’s arrest comes after he was charged by US prosecutors with running a criminal enterprise built on “human suffering.” Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department has claimed the stash of crypto they found linke d hi m to the largest-ever cryptocurrency seizure, which saw authorities confiscate approximately $15 billion in Bitcoin allegedly tied to his operations. With his alleged network, Zhi reportedly ran scam compounds in Cambodia that dealt in various forms of debauchery, including sextortion, illegal online gambling, and the trafficking and torture of workers forced to conduct online frauds. Authorities in the US and UK have imposed sanctions on more than 100 companies and 17 individuals linked to his network, calling it an elaborate web of shell companies that helped him to launder proceeds from industrial-scale scams while keeping a low radar . The operations reportedly had compounds like the Golden Fortune Science and Technology Park, where victims would allegedly be forced to commit online fraud. The crackdown on Zhi and his associated operations has resulted in far-reaching global consequences. South Korea froze millions in bank deposits, Thailand seized his assets , Singapore dismissed an application to release over $300,000 in seized funds from a Chen-linked family office. The funds were denied because a Singaporean judge was unconvinced about the credibility of the applicant, noting the complexity of the transnational money laundering probe. Chen Zhi had been a menace for years Chen Zhi, who is famous for his reserved demeanor and unassuming look, did not have much when he first left his home country for Cambodia rapidly. He did not stay down for long, though. He reportedly hails from China’s Fujian province and moved to Cambodia over a decade ago, after which he leveraged a Cambodian property bull market to build the Prince Group conglomerate , which he then scaled until it included a commercial bank, an airline, luxury real estate, and was getting ambitious multi-billion-dollar development projects. Later on, he secured citizenship in the country and went on to develop close relationships with its political elite, which led to him being awarded honorary titles for his philanthropic donations. All of this he did while he stayed lowkey, a fact that may have helped him get away with his racket for as long as he did. In the years that followed his arrival in Cambodia, Chen Zhi operated with impunity, with those at the highest levels of Cambodian power literally eating out of his hand. His sudden arrest and removal to China come amid intense international pressure on Cambodia to address the criminal enterprises Zhi managed within its borders. It also represents a potentially decisive blow to an alleged fraud network that spanned continents and victimized thousands in the process. Prince Group has attempted to distance itself from him and previously denied any involvement in scams, even calling the allegations false. While Chen Zhi remains indicted in the US, Cambodia has no extradition treaty with the US, which is why his rapid transfer to China makes sense. Get seen where it counts.

The call signals a clear shift in market focus, as investors hunt for larger percentage moves beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies. Why XRP Is Beating Bitcoin and Ethereum Right Now During CNBC’s Power Lunch segment, which aired on January 6, host Brian Sullivan set the tone plainly: “The hottest crypto trade of the year is not Bitcoin, it is not Ether, it is XRP.” He noted that XRP is already up more than 20% this year and has climbed into the top three cryptocurrencies by market value, with “big money behind this trade.” CNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos explained that the trend started quietly in late 2025. “During the doldrums of Q4, you actually saw a lot of people piling into those XRP ETFs,” she said, adding that this behavior contrasted with Bitcoin and ETH ETFs, where flows tend to follow price more closely. Investors, she noted, viewed XRP as “a less crowded train than Bitcoin or Ether,” a bet that paid off in the first trading days of January. That view lines up with recent data, which shows XRP rising from under $1.85 to just over $2.40 within days, supported by steady inflows into spot XRP ETFs and a drop in exchange-held balances. The Ripple token is currently trading around $2.25 after a 24-hour pullback of about 5%, following a strong weekly climb of nearly 20%. Over the past month, XRP has gained roughly 7%, although it remains about 38% below its all-time high of $3.65 per CoinGecko. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is hovering just under $92,000, down about 2% on the day and largely flat over the last 30 days. On its part, ETH is holding near $3,200, with modest weekly gains but weaker long-term momentum. Bigger Shift in Crypto Markets In the CNBC show, Sigalos also pointed to XRP’s long-standing payments focus while grouping it with Solana (SOL) as one of the altcoins drawing renewed interest. “Those are the two very popular altcoins right now,” she said, explaining the appeal as being down to investors looking elsewhere for larger percentage gains since Bitcoin has become more established. She also detailed distinct use cases driving the interest: XRP for cross-border payments and Solana for its speed and low cost in tokenizing assets like money market funds. “The GENIUS Act was passed into law last year, so we saw a lot more stablecoin issuers,” Sigalos noted, adding that these issuers operate across multiple blockchains. She identified cost as a critical factor, saying, “Solana is a lot more cost-effective than moving money over the Ethereum blockchain at different points, which is why you’re seeing people diversify away from the big two.” On the same day as the broadcast, news broke that Morgan Stanley had filed to launch its own Bitcoin and Solana ETFs. Furthermore, Coinbase’s December 2025 integration of Solana decentralized exchange trading for its 100 million users was cited as a major step in expanding access to that ecosystem.

Despite the recent rebound in BTC’s price, several key metrics are down , showing that on-chain activity is trending in a different direction. Cycle-Low Bitcoin VDD Hints At Minimal Coin Movement Bitcoin’s price is gradually undergoing a recovery, but its on-chain action is moving into an unusually subtle phase. This divergence is observed in the recent performance of the Bitcoin Value Days Destroyed (VDD) metric, which has fallen sharply. It is worth noting that the BTC VDD is a method of measuring long-term holders’ activity similar to the BTC Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, but including a valuation component. In other words, it allocates a value based on the price of Bitcoin at the time the UTXO is spent, in addition to the number of holding days lost. In this case, VDD is expressed as a ratio to evaluate its velocity in relation to its annual average. Furthermore, the ratio between the annual average and the monthly average helps to position current activity in relation to the annual norm. After examining the BTC VDD metric, Darkfost, a market expert and CryptoQuant author, noted that the metric has fallen to historical low levels for this market cycle. According to the expert, this shift comes following a period of heavy long-term holder distribution that has now significantly declined. As seen in the chart, the market is now entering a period in which the VDD has dropped sharply and is now at extremely low levels relative to its annual average. This trend indicates a huge decline in selling pressure from long-term BTC holders . With the metric at 0.55, the current VDD is roughly twice the annual average. Such levels have repeatedly been observed following significant corrections in the ongoing cycle. Interestingly, this suggests that long-term holders are presently choosing to hold onto their coins at current price levels. BTC’s Upward Trend Is Still Intact The price of Bitcoin experienced a brief pullback as Tuesday drew to a close, which raised questions about its price stability . Amid this discussion, Milk Road, a crypto and macro researcher, has offered insights into BTC’s current price action, highlighting that the market is still bullish. Milk Road’s objective is based on a multi-year Ascending Channel pattern. According to the expert, BTC has been moving inside the upward channel since 2022, making higher highs and higher lows. While the recent drop pushed BTC’s price toward the bottom of the upward channel, the support line held strong, leading to a bounce. Following the bounce, Bitcoin formed another higher low, which is the line that is keeping the upward trend intact. Therefore, unless BTC goes below that range, the larger pattern is still heading higher despite the fact that the price has been sideways for months.",Bitcoin|Ascending Channel Pattern|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Value Days Destroyed|btc|BTC Coin Days Destroyed|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CDD|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|Milk Road|VDD,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Meanwhile, trading volume sits above $28 billion. With the recent move above the 21-day moving average, some traders are watching for the beginning of a new trend. Ethereum Breaks Above 21-Day MA ETH has closed several daily candles above its 21-day moving average on the ETH/BTC pair. Michaël van de Poppe noted , “It broke above the 21-Day MA and it held it as support.” He suggested this may be the first real uptrend since the summer months. ETH is holding above 0.035 BTC, following a long consolidation period. This zone had previously acted as a resistance during the decline. Now that the price is above it, the level is being treated as support. Momentum has picked up, with RSI values rising but not yet at overheated levels. In addition, Ethereum has bounced multiple times from a support area between 0.03 and 0.0325 BTC. That zone has held since late 2025. Daan Crypto Trades described ETH as “ very compressed against BTC, ” adding that a large move could follow. He also pointed to the 200-day moving average and the 0.032 level as key markers if price turns lower. On the ETH/USDT chart, the token has cleared a descending channel. The breakout comes after several months of lower highs. Lucky shared the chart, noting Ethereum’s move back above $3,200 and into a previous support area that had acted as resistance during the downtrend. $ETH is following the pattern. https://t.co/xrPXHoi0kV pic.twitter.com/oUdIEgmMrs — Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) January 7, 2026 Price Patterns and Short-Term Levels ETH recently closed its first red daily candle in six sessions. Analyst Ted commented , “This was needed, as it has now cleared most late longs.” He believes the trend remains in place if ETH stays above $3,200. Elsewhere, CryptosBatman mentioned a possible double bottom, but said the chart is “ still not in the clear ” due to nearby resistance. A breakout could push the next target to $3,900, which aligns with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. On another front, data from CryptoQuant shows under 16.5 million ETH held on exchanges, close to the lowest levels in years. Low reserves suggest little selling pressure in the near term. At the same time, net inflows into spot ETH ETFs have turned positive. That shift signals renewed interest from institutions, adding another layer of support for Ethereum’s current move.

56945945,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259512,1767813311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets: BTC Falls Below $91,000 Amidst Market Uncertainty",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-91000-5/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets: BTC Falls Below $91,000 Amidst Market Uncertainty Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant shift on April 2, 2025, as Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset, experienced a notable decline, falling below the $91,000 threshold. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $90,959.44 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price movement represents a pivotal moment for investors and analysts tracking the volatile crypto landscape. The drop below this key psychological level prompts a deeper examination of market dynamics, historical patterns, and the underlying factors influencing digital asset valuation. Bitcoin Price Drops Below Critical Support Level The descent of Bitcoin below $91,000 marks a breach of a short-term support zone that market participants had closely watched. Consequently, this movement has triggered a wave of analysis across trading desks and financial news outlets. The price of $90,959.44 reflects a specific moment in a continuous 24-hour global trading cycle. Furthermore, this event occurs within a broader context of macroeconomic indicators and regulatory developments affecting digital assets globally. Market data shows trading volume spiked during the decline, indicating heightened activity. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience after similar corrections. For instance, previous cycles in 2021 and 2023 saw sharp pullbacks before establishing new highs. Technical analysts often examine moving averages and trading volume to gauge momentum. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages provide context for whether a move is a short-term fluctuation or a longer-term trend change. Currently, the market is digesting a combination of on-chain data and external financial pressures. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Market Context Several interconnected factors typically contribute to Bitcoin price volatility. Firstly, macroeconomic conditions heavily influence investor sentiment toward risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Rising interest rates or inflation data can prompt capital rotation out of speculative holdings. Secondly, regulatory news from major economies like the United States or the European Union can create immediate market reactions. Thirdly, internal network metrics, such as hash rate and active address counts, provide fundamental health indicators. Market sentiment tools, like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, offer a snapshot of trader psychology. A shift from ‘greed’ to ‘fear’ can often precede or accompany price drops. Additionally, the actions of large holders, often called ‘whales,’ can be tracked via blockchain analysis. Their movement of funds to or from exchanges frequently signals accumulation or distribution phases. The derivatives market also plays a crucial role, with funding rates on perpetual swaps indicating leverage sentiment. Expert Perspectives on Market Movements Financial analysts and cryptocurrency researchers provide valuable context for such price actions. For example, analysts at firms like Glassnode or CoinMetrics often publish data-driven reports on market structure. They examine exchange inflows, miner selling pressure, and liquidations in the futures market. According to common analytical frameworks, a price drop accompanied by high futures market liquidations can indicate a flushing of excess leverage, which is sometimes viewed as a healthy market reset. Industry veterans frequently reference Bitcoin’s historical volatility as a characteristic feature, not a bug. Its price discovery is a global, 24/7 process reacting to a vast array of information. Comparisons to traditional market corrections are common, with experts noting that a 10-20% move in Bitcoin is statistically normal within a given quarter. The key focus for long-term investors often remains on network adoption, security, and its evolving role as a digital store of value versus short-term price fluctuations. Historical Precedents and Technical Analysis Bitcoin’s price history is filled with similar corrections. A review of past cycles shows that dips of varying magnitudes have consistently occurred. The table below illustrates notable corrections in Bitcoin’s history and their subsequent market phases: Year Correction Magnitude Time to Recover Primary Market Phase 2017 -40% ~2 months Bull Market 2019 -60% ~5 months Bear Market Rally 2021 -55% ~3 months Cycle Top Formation 2023 -20% ~1 month Early Bull Market Technical analysis uses chart patterns and indicators to interpret price action. Key levels to watch after a break below $91,000 include: Immediate Support: The $88,000 – $89,000 range, which acted as resistance in previous weeks. Volume Profile: Areas where significant trading volume occurred, creating potential support zones. On-Chain Support: The aggregate cost basis of recent investors, often a strong psychological level. Market participants also monitor the strength of alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. Often, Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) shifts during market stress, indicating whether capital is fleeing to Bitcoin or away from the entire asset class. The Impact on Traders and Long-Term Holders Different market participants experience this volatility uniquely. Short-term traders and leverage users face immediate risk from such moves. Margin calls and liquidations can cascade, exacerbating the downward move. Conversely, long-term holders, often following a ‘HODL’ strategy, may view dips as potential accumulation opportunities. Data from entities like Chainalysis shows distinct behavioral patterns between these cohorts during volatility. Institutional investors, who have entered the space through ETFs and dedicated funds, typically have longer time horizons and risk management protocols. Their reaction often involves rebalancing portfolios rather than panic selling. The growing maturity of the market infrastructure, including regulated custodians and derivatives, provides more tools for managing this volatility compared to earlier years. This evolution contributes to the changing nature of market cycles. Regulatory and Macroeconomic Backdrop The current trading environment does not exist in a vacuum. Central bank policies, particularly from the U.S. Federal Reserve, directly impact liquidity conditions for all risk assets. Statements regarding interest rate paths or quantitative tightening can trigger cross-asset repricing. Simultaneously, regulatory clarity, or the lack thereof, in major jurisdictions creates uncertainty. Legislative efforts concerning digital asset classification, taxation, and custody rules are closely monitored by the industry. Geopolitical events also play a role, as Bitcoin is sometimes perceived as a geopolitical-neutral asset. However, its correlation with traditional equity markets, particularly tech stocks, has increased in recent years. This correlation means that broad-based sell-offs in the Nasdaq, for example, can often pressure Bitcoin concurrently. Analysts therefore recommend a multi-factor framework for understanding price drivers, rather than attributing moves to a single cause. Conclusion The Bitcoin price movement below $91,000 to $90,959.44 is a significant event within the ongoing narrative of cryptocurrency market evolution. It underscores the inherent volatility of the asset class while highlighting the sophisticated analytical frameworks now used to interpret such moves. This decline serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between technical levels, macroeconomic forces, and investor sentiment. For the market to advance, understanding these dynamics is crucial for participants ranging from casual observers to institutional allocators. The path forward will likely be determined by fundamental network growth, regulatory developments, and broader financial market conditions. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $91,000? Market analysts attribute the drop to a combination of factors including profit-taking after a recent rally, a shift in broader risk-asset sentiment, potential over-leverage in the derivatives market being liquidated, and reactions to upcoming macroeconomic data releases. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, volatility is a well-documented characteristic of Bitcoin. Historical data shows corrections of 10-30% are common within both bull and bear market cycles. The asset’s 24/7 global trading and relatively young market structure contribute to these frequent price swings. Q3: What key support levels do traders watch after this drop? Technical analysts typically monitor previous consolidation zones, such as $88,000-$89,000, and longer-term moving averages like the 50-day or 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). On-chain data points like the Realized Price or Short-Term Holder cost basis are also critical support metrics. Q4: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC can lead to correlated selling in major altcoins (like Ethereum) and often results in even larger percentage declines for more speculative tokens, as investors reduce overall risk exposure. Q5: What should investors consider during such volatility? Investors are advised to review their risk tolerance, ensure their portfolio allocation aligns with their long-term strategy, avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term price action, and consider the fundamental reasons for their investment, such as Bitcoin’s scarcity and network security, rather than daily price quotes.

The pullback raises fresh questions about whether the recent rally is losing momentum or simply pausing after weeks of heavy inflows. Source: Sosovalue The outflow marked a clear contrast to the prior trading sessions, but broader data suggests investor interest remains structurally intact rather than broken. Bitcoin ETFs See Brief Dip, but Big Money Stays Put SoSoValue data shows that despite the one-day drawdown, cumulative net inflows across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $57.54 billion since launch. Total assets held by the products amounted to $120.85 billion, equivalent to about 6.54% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Trading activity also remained active, with $4.33 billion in value exchanged across the funds on the day, pointing to repositioning rather than an outright exit. Fund-level data shows that the pullback was not evenly distributed. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust continued to absorb capital, recording a daily net inflow of $228.66 million, equivalent to roughly 2,470 BTC. IBIT now holds $72.15 billion in net assets, with cumulative inflows of $62.98 billion, giving it the largest share of the Bitcoin ETF market . The fund traded more than $529 million in value on the day, even as its price slipped 1.33% to $51.76. The overall outflow was driven largely by redemptions elsewhere. Source: Sosovalue Fidelity’s FBTC saw $312.24 million exit the fund, the largest daily outflow among issuers, while Grayscale’s GBTC continued its long-running bleed with $83.07 million leaving on the day. GBTC’s cumulative net outflows have now reached $25.32 billion, though it still holds $15.17 billion in assets. Grayscale’s newer low-fee BTC product also recorded a $32.73 million outflow, while ARK 21Shares’ ARKB and VanEck’s HODL posted smaller redemptions. Several funds, including Bitwise’s BITB and Invesco’s BTCO, saw flat flows, suggesting a pause rather than a broad exit. ETF Volatility Emerges, but Bitcoin Shows Resilience The negative daily print followed a strong start to the year. On January 5, Bitcoin ETFs posted $697.25 million in net inflows, while January 2 saw $471.14 million enter the products. On a weekly basis, flows remained positive, with $454.01 million added by the week ending January 6. Source: Sosovalue January as a whole has already logged $925.15 million in net inflows, reversing December’s $1.09 billion monthly outflow and pushing total assets higher month over month. Bitcoin itself has shown resilience despite ETF volatility. The asset is trading around $91,119, up 3.1% over the past 24 hours, with daily trading volume rising more than 22% to $61.56 billion. Source: Cryptonews While still nearly 28% below its all-time high of $126,080, Bitcoin has posted modest gains across weekly and biweekly time frames, reinforcing the view that the ETF pullback aligns with routine profit-taking rather than a decisive trend reversal. Broader developments continue to support that interpretation. Spot Bitcoin ETFs generated roughly $21.8 billion in net inflows during 2025, making them one of the most successful ETF product launches on record, even as inflows slowed from 2024’s pace. Institutional engagement also appears to be expanding. Morgan Stanley filed registration statements on January 6 to launch its own spot Bitcoin ETF, alongside proposed Ethereum and Solana trusts . @MorganStanley files an S-1 registration with the @SECGov for a Bitcoin Trust and Solana product. #CryptoAdoption #Bitcoin https://t.co/rOFrtNJUMh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 6, 2026 The move shows the ongoing interest from major financial institutions, even as short-term flows fluctuate. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs continued to attract capital. U.S. ETH ETFs recorded $114.74 million in net inflows on the same day Bitcoin products saw outflows, lifting cumulative ETH inflows to $12.79 billion. Source: Sosovalue BlackRock’s ETHA again led the group, highlighting that investor demand for regulated crypto exposure remains diversified rather than singularly focused on Bitcoin.

The sale came despite Riot producing more bitcoin month over month, showing how pressure from collapsing hashprice is now overriding the long-standing “hodl” approach once favored by large public miners. Riot Steps Up Bitcoin Sales as Hashprice Slumps to Five-Year Lows The US-listed miner sold 1,818 bitcoin during the month at an average net price of $88,870, according to its latest production and operations update released on January 6. That marked a 375% increase from November sales and pushed Riot’s bitcoin holdings down to 18,005 BTC, compared with more than 19,300 a month earlier. t Riot Announces December 2025 Production and Operations Updates. Riot mined 460 #bitcoin in December, averaging 14.8 Bitcoin per day. The Company maintained an efficient all-in power cost of 3.9¢/kWh. Read the full press release here: https://t.co/FFOIqhG1Wo . pic.twitter.com/fg2s3tLIW8 — Riot Platforms, Inc. (@RiotPlatforms) January 6, 2026 Despite producing 460 bitcoin in December, the company liquidated nearly four times that amount, underlining the severity of the current profitability squeeze. Average daily production rose slightly to 14.8 BTC, while deployed hash rate climbed to 38.5 exahash per second in December, up 22% year-on-year, while average operating hashrate rose to 34.9 EH/s. The selloff comes as hashprice, a key measure of miner revenue per unit of computing power, continues to hover near $37 per petahash per second, close to a five-year low. While Bitcoin reached new all-time highs in 2025 , rising network difficulty and relentless hashrate growth eroded margins across the industry. Glassnode data shows total network hashrate has slipped from around 1.1 zettahash per second to just above 1 ZH/s, showing that some miners are already capitulating or curtailing operations. Source: Glassnode Fleet efficiency improved to 20.2 joules per terahash, down from 21.9 J/TH a year earlier. Power costs remained competitive at 3.9 cents per kilowatt hour, supported by $6.2 million in power and demand response credits. That would offer limited short-term relief, but the broader trend remains challenging. Following the April 2024 halving , block rewards dropped to 3.125 BTC per block, or roughly 450 BTC per day across the network. Transaction fees contributed less than 1% of revenue for much of 2025, leaving operators highly exposed to difficulty increases. As Mining Costs Soar, Bitcoin Miners Rethink Their Playbook Bitcoin difficulty reached a record 155.98 trillion in October and currently sits near 148.2 trillion, with only a modest 3% decline expected in the next adjustment. Data from CoinShares shows that in the second quarter of 2025, the average direct cash cost to mine one bitcoin for public miners was about $74,600. Source: Coinshares When non-cash expenses such as depreciation are included, total costs rise above $137,000. By late 2025, median “hash cost” estimates suggested many miners were operating at or below breakeven, even with efficient fleets and favorable power contracts. Riot’s decision to sell more bitcoin rather than hold mirrors a broader shift among large miners. Throughout 2025, firms responded to pressure by expanding hashrate, tightening costs, and increasingly diversifying into artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. Firms like CleanSpark, TeraWulf, Cipher Mining, and Bitfarms have signed multi-year, multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure deals , while others are repurposing entire mining sites. @Bitfarms_io shares dropped 18% as it announced a wind-down in $BTC operations to pivot to AI infrastructure after a $46M Q3 loss. #Bitcoin #AI https://t.co/3Q7tsldFzS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Riot executives have previously said the company now views mining as a way to monetize power access rather than an end in itself. That logic is widely shared across the sector, even as aggregate miner debt has surged, rising from about $2.1 billion to $12.7 billion over the past year as companies financed expansion and diversification. Riot also announced that December will be its final monthly production report. Going forward, the company plans to provide quarterly updates focused on broader business performance, data center strategy, and mining operations.

Tether and Rumble Launch Rumble Wallet, Bringing Self-Custodial Crypto Payments to Millions of Creators and Users Learn more: https://t.co/LbZzrghOe8 — Tether (@Tether_to) January 7, 2026 The wallet marks a shift from basic crypto tipping toward a fully integrated platform-native payments infrastructure designed for creators and users at scale. At launch the Rumble Wallet supports Tether USD (USDT), Tether Gold (XAUT) and Bitcoin allowing audiences to tip creators and make peer-to-peer payments without relying on traditional banks or payment processors. Support for Tether USAT is expected in the coming weeks. Self-Custody and Creator Payments Rumble said it aims to allow creators to receive funds instantly while maintaining full control over their assets. Unlike custodial models where platforms or third parties hold user balances Rumble Wallet gives users direct ownership of their crypto reducing exposure to account freezes and payment delays. For creators the wallet opens a new monetization layer that operates globally and around the clock. For users, it provides a way to hold and transfer digital assets natively within the platform without having to bridge funds in and out of external services. Powered by Open Wallet Infrastructure Rumble Wallet is built using Tether’s Wallet Development Kit, an open-source modular toolkit designed to help platforms deploy self-custodial wallets while preserving user privacy and control. The wallet connects Rumble’s video-sharing ecosystem directly to crypto-native payment rails allowing financial interactions to occur alongside content consumption. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the product brings together decentralization, financial freedom and free expression. He adds that embedding self-custodial crypto tools into a mainstream platform gives tens of millions of users greater control than is typically offered by social media or payment platforms, including in the U.S. market. A Broader Vision for Crypto-Native Monetization The wallet launch builds on a wider collaboration between Tether and Rumble focused on using Bitcoin and stablecoins as practical tools for creator empowerment. The partnership was first outlined publicly at the Plan ₿ Forum in Lugano last year, where both companies described a vision for crypto-native monetization that reduces reliance on centralized financial gatekeepers. Rumble founder and CEO Chris Pavlovski said Rumble Wallet reflects the platform’s emphasis on free expression and user autonomy, giving creators and audiences new ways to support content directly. Embedding Crypto Into Real-World Platforms The launch of Rumble Wallet is part of Tether’s broader strategy of embedding open financial infrastructure into consumer platforms with large active user bases. Rather than positioning crypto as a standalone product, the collaboration integrates self-custodial payments into everyday digital experiences potentially expanding crypto’s reach to millions of mainstream users.

The newly appointed crypto policy hitters will bring experience across financial services, regulation, industry leadership, and public pension management. FINRA oversees the organization’s mission to protect investors and ensure market integrity for broker-dealers handling everything from stocks to crypto trades. The board has appointed four figures, including Rostin ‘Russ’ Behnam, Tim Carter, Dan Gallagher, and Heather Traeger, to strengthen its oversight as crypto continues to form ties with traditional financial markets. Former CFTC head Behnam brings crypto expertise to FINRA According to FINRA’s press release , the board appointed Behnam, who chaired the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) between 2021 and January 2025. During his tenure at the CFTC, Behnam oversaw crypto futures and advocated for comprehensive digital asset regulations. Based on his first speech as chair at the CFTC, Behnam highlighted the scale of the $3.5 trillion digital asset market and vowed to support proactive federal oversight to protect investors, ensure market integrity, curb manipulation, and enable the mainstream adoption of blockchain, tokenization, and DeFi ecosystems. Rostin Behnam cracked down on fraud while advocating for clearer frameworks across the digital market ecosystem. Currently, he serves as a distinguished member at Georgetown University’s Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. Behnams’ expertise could help FINRA navigate areas where crypto connects with securities. Dan Gallagher, on the other hand, brings expertise as a Chief Legal Officer in Compliance and Corporate Affairs from Robinhood Markets. Robinhood is a FINRA-regulated broker enabling investors and retail traders a gateway to the crypto ecosystem. The platform offers trading in several crypto assets, including BTC, ETH, and XRP. Gallagher has also served as the SEC Commissioner between 2011 and 2015, a role that offers him a blended expertise in crypto innovation and regulatory compliance. Gallagher may help FINRA to push for standards that make crypto brokers such as Robinhood robust and user-friendly in order to accelerate global crypto adoption. FINRA also appointed Tim Carter, former CFO at investment bank and institutional securities firm Piper Sandler Companies. Carter brings in expertise in financial accounting, treasury, market and credit risk, investor relations, and financial planning. While he is not a direct crypto player, his background in financial accounting could ensure a balanced oversight for institutional players eyeing crypto allocation across BTC ETFs and other crypto derivatives. Cook shows strong conviction in the new members to strengthen oversight Heather Traeger, the General Counsel at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, one of the largest public pensions in the U.S., brings expertise from her previous roles at the SEC and as a partner at O’Melveny & Myers. She also previously served at FINRA as Chair of the National Adjudicatory Council. Such a blend of expertise could prove invaluable in ensuring fair markets as digital assets mature from retail speculation towards regulated institutional flows. The crypto ecosystem’s power is rapidly shifting from retail speculation towards institutional flows. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , the current environment has prompted investors to ask whether there is a way to participate in crypto without being exposed to constant price fluctuations. The answer appears to suggest a more regulated ecosystem dominated by regulated institutions. FINRA CEO Robert Cook welcomed the four board members, who bring a strong conviction and deep expertise, along with diverse perspectives, to FINRA’s regulatory approach as it meets the current, evolving needs of investors and the market. Cook said that the appointments will strengthen the board’s ability to provide strategic oversight and guidance in the current complex financial landscape. Scott Curtis, FINRA’s Board Chair, said that the four distinguished leaders reflect the firm’s commitment to maintaining its investor protection mission effectively. FINRA is led by a 22-member Board of Governors, 12 of whom are designated as public members and 10 are appointed from the industry. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The dollar fell 39% against gold while declining 12% against the euro and 13% against the Swiss franc. “ The biggest story and the biggest market moves of the year were the result of the weakest fiat currencies falling the most, while the strongest/hardest currencies strengthened the most, ” Dalio wrote in his year-end reflection. His analysis reveals gold returned 65% in dollar terms, outperforming the S&P 500 by 47%. “ The S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms, ” he noted. European stocks outperformed US equities by 23% and Chinese stocks by 21%, reflecting what Dalio describes as “ big shifts in flows, values, and, in turn, wealth away from the US. “ https://t.co/5mkvsUPpQG — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) January 5, 2026 Dollar Weakness Reflects Structural Fiscal Pressures The currency’s decline stems from structural fiscal imbalances and shifting expectations for monetary policy. “ A large amount of debt (nearly $10tn) will need to be rolled going forward, ” Dalio wrote, warning that simultaneous Fed easing to push real interest rates down makes “ debt assets look unappealing, especially at the long end of the curve. “ He expects “ a further steepening of the yield curve seems probable. “ Trump administration policies compound these pressures through what Dalio calls “ an all-out aggressive bet on capitalism ” involving stimulative fiscal policy and reduced regulations to boost manufacturing. While aimed at revitalizing manufacturing, these measures widen wealth gaps as capitalists capture most gains. “ The value of money issue, otherwise known as the affordability issue, will probably be the number one political issue next year, ” he predicted, expecting it to contribute to Republican losses in the House. Geopolitical shifts accelerated dollar weakness. “ In 2025 there was a clear shift from multilateralism to unilateralism, ” Dalio observed, noting this raised conflict threats and “ contributed to the increased use of economic threats and sanctions, protectionism, deglobalization ” while strengthening demand for gold. Yield Curve Steepening Signals Shifting Financial Conditions The US bond market entered 2026 with its steepest yield curve since 2021, with the spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries reaching 140 basis points, Bitfinex analysts noted in their latest report . Source: Bitfinex Report They added that this reflects markets expecting policy rate cuts while demanding higher compensation for holding long-term government debt amid inflation uncertainty and heavy Treasury issuance. The curve steepens when long-term rates rise faster than short-term rates, creating what the report describes as “ higher term premia, persistent inflation uncertainty, heavy Treasury issuance, and growing fiscal concerns. ” While lower policy rates suggest accommodation, elevated long-term yields continue raising borrowing costs across the economy, partially offsetting relief from front-end easing. For equities, higher long-term discount rates limit valuation expansion, particularly for growth stocks whose earnings lie far in the future. The report notes that companies with near-term cash flows, pricing power, and tangible assets tend to fare better in this environment. In times like this, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has framed Bitcoin as applying constructive pressure on US policymakers to maintain fiscal responsibility. “ Bitcoin provides a check and balance on the dollar, ” he said on a recent Tetragrammaton podcast. Armstrong also warns that inflation without matching growth could cost the dollar its reserve status. Precious Metals Rally Delays Crypto Upside Bitcoin and Ethereum’s consolidation connect to capital flowing into precious metals amid geopolitical stress. Speaking with Cryptonews, Farzam Ehsani, co-founder and CEO of VALR, notes gold rose 69% and silver surged 161% over the past year. Long-term Bitcoin holders stopped selling for the first time since July, while Ethereum showed improving fundamentals, including a cleared staking exit queue and record transaction activity at historically low fees. “ Bitcoin’s current sideways movement against the backdrop of record-breaking gains in gold and silver resembles a ‘calm before the storm,’ typically followed by a broader crypto market rally ,” Ehsani said. He projects that Bitcoin could reach $130,000 and Ethereum $4,500 in Q1 2026, once precious metals momentum fades, with significantly higher upside if gold and silver experience sharper corrections.

In a Jan. 5 statement , the Bitcoin Core Project warned on X that “under rare circumstances, migrating a legacy (BDB) wallet can delete all wallet files on the same node. If those wallets aren’t backed up, this can result in a loss of funds.” The team said a fix is slated for Bitcoin Core 30.2 and advised users not to migrate legacy wallets using 30.0 or 30.1 until that release is available. “Only the legacy wallet migration process is affected. All other uses are unaffected. You can continue using Bitcoin Core normally, including existing wallets and running a node without wallets.” Bitcoin Community Divided Over Severity The disclosure caps a simmering thread of reports and frustration among users tracking the issue on GitHub. One X user, posting under the handle @B__T__C, claimed “several users had been reporting it for over two weeks” and argued the bug proved difficult for maintainers to reproduce, linking to a public issue thread. Another account, Greg Tonoski (@GregTonoski), pointed to earlier warnings ahead of the v30 release and suggested the episode reflects a broader disconnect between developers and users. “Users had warned @bitcoincoreorg (@achow101) a month before the v30 release,” he wrote, adding: “I am starting to doubt if Bitcoin is still catering to the Bitcoin user’s needs.” The sharpest debate, however, has been over how “rare” translates into real-world risk, especially given the migration path that v30 users may face. @barackomaba argued the impact is being understated because Bitcoin Core v30.0 “explicitly stopped loading or creating BDB legacy wallets,” leaving affected users with a practical next step: migrate. “People are acting like legacy wallet migration is some obscure edge case,” the account wrote. “But v30.0 explicitly stopped loading or creating BDB legacy wallets, so anyone who upgraded to v30 and still had a legacy wallet in Bitcoin Core effectively had only one path forward: migrate.” ‘Legacy wallets’ were the default wallet type until April 2022 (before 23.0, new wallets were ‘legacy’ by default). Also, the migration needs to fail. This won’t be the majority of migrations obviously, but there are many plausible ways to trigger this.” He then described one such scenario: a user pruning their node while the wallet wasn’t loaded, which can cause the migrated wallet load step to fail, sending the process down a “cleanup path” that deletes the entire wallet directory and “everything in it,” including other wallets and even rollback backups created during migration. Not everyone agreed the incident merits alarm. @w_s_bitcoin pushed back by emphasizing adoption and observed impact, arguing that Core v30 “currently” accounts for “1/5th of all the Bitcoin nodes” and that “reportedly only one single user was affected by this bug.” Wicked characterized it as “a shitty bug,” but added that it “didn’t result in any known bitcoin losses,” and said the fix is welcome. What is not in dispute, based on Bitcoin Core’s own notice, is the practical guidance: users running 30.0 or 30.1 should avoid migrating legacy (BDB) wallets until 30.2 ships, and ensure wallet files are backed up before attempting any migration at all.

Analysis of past market cycles reveals a consistent tendency for powerful rebounds in the years immediately following an annual price decline. This pattern, highlighted by industry experts, provides crucial context for investors navigating the current market landscape. Bitcoin Price Rally: A Historical Blueprint for Recovery Bitcoin’s journey since its inception has been marked by extreme volatility. However, within this volatility, analysts identify a recurring sequence. Specifically, years that conclude with negative annual returns have consistently preceded periods of substantial price appreciation. Jesse Myers, Head of Bitcoin Strategy at Smarter Web Company, recently quantified this phenomenon. His analysis, cited by CoinDesk, points to a clear historical trend of recovery. According to the data, Bitcoin recorded negative annual returns in 2014, 2018, and 2022. Subsequently, the cryptocurrency staged impressive comebacks. The year following each decline saw a powerful Bitcoin price rally. For instance, after the 2014 decline, Bitcoin rebounded with a 35% gain. Following the 2018 downturn, the recovery was a dramatic 95%. Most recently, after 2022’s bear market, Bitcoin surged by an astonishing 156%. Consequently, the average recovery rate across these three historical instances stands at approximately 95%. This figure provides a quantitative benchmark for potential market movements. The pattern underscores Bitcoin’s historical resilience. It demonstrates an ability to absorb significant downward pressure before embarking on a new upward trajectory. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Recovery Cycle Understanding this cycle requires examining the market mechanics behind each period. The annual losses typically coincide with major macroeconomic events or internal market shocks. For example, the 2014 decline followed the Mt. Gox exchange collapse. Similarly, the 2018 downturn ended a speculative bubble. Finally, the 2022 bear market reacted to aggressive global monetary tightening. Each event, while different, catalyzed a prolonged period of pessimism and capitulation. This process often resets market leverage and washes out weak hands. Subsequently, it creates a stronger foundation for the next growth phase. The subsequent cryptocurrency recovery, therefore, is not random. It often aligns with improving fundamentals, renewed institutional interest, or broader macroeconomic shifts. Key drivers historically fueling post-loss rallies include: Halving Events: Bitcoin’s programmed supply reductions have preceded major bull markets. Institutional Adoption: Increased investment from corporations and funds provides new capital inflows. Macroeconomic Conditions: Shifts toward loose monetary policy can boost risk assets like Bitcoin. Technological Advancements: Network upgrades and layer-2 solutions improve utility and perception. Expert Insight on Current Market Parallels Jesse Myers suggests the established pattern could repeat. Following a reported annual loss in 2025, a similar upward trend may resume. This projection is not a guarantee but a observation based on historical precedent. Myers’ role at Smarter Web Company involves strategic blockchain analysis, lending authority to his assessment. It is crucial to contextualize this analysis within the 2025 market environment. Current factors differ from past cycles. Regulatory frameworks are more defined. Institutional custody solutions are robust. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets continues to evolve. These new variables mean any future Bitcoin price rally may unfold differently. However, the core psychological and cyclical drivers may remain consistent. The table below summarizes the historical data underpinning this analysis: Year of Annual Loss Following Year Rally Potential Catalysts 2014 +35% Market maturation post-Mt. Gox 2018 +95% Institutional interest begins, futures markets 2022 +156% Spot ETF approvals, macro pivot expectations Average ~95% N/A Broader Implications for Digital Asset Investment This historical pattern holds significant implications for portfolio strategy. It highlights the importance of a long-term perspective in cryptocurrency investing. Reacting solely to short-term annual losses can lead to missed opportunities. The data suggests that periods of maximum pessimism have often been optimal entry points. Of course, past performance never guarantees future results. Investors must also consider risk management. A potential 95% average recovery follows a 100% loss of value from all-time highs. The volatility cuts both ways. Therefore, any strategy based on this pattern should account for substantial drawdowns. Diversification and position sizing remain paramount principles. Moreover, this analysis reinforces Bitcoin’s unique position as a cyclical asset. Its fixed supply and growing adoption create a push-pull dynamic with market sentiment. The historical tendency for a strong Bitcoin price rally after downturns reflects this fundamental tension. It shows a market that learns, adapts, and ultimately grows through each cycle. Conclusion Historical data presents a compelling narrative for Bitcoin investors. The cryptocurrency has demonstrated a repeated capacity for a powerful Bitcoin price rally in the years following an annual loss. With an average historical rebound of 95%, this pattern offers a framework for understanding market cycles. While 2025 presents a new set of challenges and variables, the cyclical nature of the asset class suggests observers should watch for signs of a similar recovery phase. As always, thorough research and measured risk assessment are essential when navigating these volatile markets. FAQs Q1: How many times has Bitcoin had a negative annual return? Based on the cited analysis, Bitcoin has recorded negative annual returns in at least four instances: 2014, 2018, 2022, and reportedly 2025. Q2: What was the strongest rally after an annual loss? The strongest documented rally followed the 2022 annual loss, with Bitcoin’s price increasing by approximately 156% in the subsequent period. Q3: Does this pattern guarantee Bitcoin will go up after a down year? No. Historical patterns do not guarantee future performance. They provide context and identify trends, but many external factors can influence price. Q4: What is the average recovery rate after a Bitcoin annual loss? According to the analysis of the 2014, 2018, and 2022 cycles, the average recovery rate in the following year is approximately 95%. Q5: Who provided this analysis on Bitcoin’s historical performance? The analysis was cited by CoinDesk and attributed to Jesse Myers, Head of Bitcoin Strategy at Smarter Web Company.

He is not alone in his push, as Senator Joe Gruters proposed two bills, SB 1040 and SB 1038, which also call for the creation of the reserve and a trust fund that will hold and manage digital assets. The proposal states, “To be eligible to be purchased for the reserve, a cryptocurrency must have an average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over the most recent 24-month period.” This condition means that the reserve will only keep Bitcoin, whose market capitalization exceeds $1 trillion, for now. While others fall short of this mark, the closest is Ethereum , with its market capitalization currently around $380 billion as of the time of writing. This is not the first time lawmakers have made a push to establish a crypto reserve in Florida. HB 487 and SB 550 were withdrawn in May 2025, while Representative Webster Barnaby filed HB 183 in October with revised provisions following the initial failure. Florida follows Trump executive order for BTC reserve Florida’s proposal is also coming at a time when more states are creating their own strategic crypto reserves, buoyed by the executive order issued by President Trump in March 2025, when he established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the federal level. Texas became the first state to fund a strategic cryptocurrency reserve with a $5 million Bitcoin purchase in December 2025, while New Hampshire was the first state to pass a law that established a strategic Bitcoin reserve, allowing its treasurer to invest up to 5% of public funds in digital assets exceeding $500 billion in market capitalization. Arizona also passed more limited legislation permitting the state to hold seized cryptocurrency assets. Proponents have stated that these reserves help keep state financial institutions cutting-edge while providing an inflation hedge, describing Bitcoin as a store of value for public funds comparable to how governments traditionally use gold. Senator Gruters positioned his bills as a long-term investment strategy to diversify Florida’s portfolio and adapt to the emerging digital economy. The bill plans to buff the state’s crypto stash through recoveries in legal proceedings, revenue, purchases, and rewards from blockchain forks or airdrops. Regulation is in the bag, volatility still runs wild Bitcoin hit an all-time high of over $126,198 in October and saw steep declines by the end of the same month. As of the time of writing, BTC trades around $90,000 . All these happened in 2025 when bullish speculators believed the asset would hit over $200,000. Critics have raised concerns about the wisdom of investing taxpayer money in volatile assets. Another fear surrounding digital assets, especially for institutions, both private and public, apart from volatility, lies in the unregulated nature of most of the sector. The passing of the GENIUS Act was the first step towards bringing more regulatory oversight into the space, and the CLARITY bill is expected to further regulate the space. All of these are expected to give investors the needed boost and cover, compared to the wild west that the industry had been operating in before now.

56948974,654734,1767819609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56948974.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Security Model May Shift As Quantum Computing Moves Forward: Analyst,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-security-model-may-shift-as-quantum-computing-moves-forward-analyst/,bitcoinist,"A Coinbase research lead has warned that advances in quantum computing could pose wider risks to Bitcoin than simple wallet theft. According to David Duong , the company’s global head of investment research, future quantum machines might be able to break the cryptographic signatures that secure transactions and could also give quantum-powered miners a big speed edge — two separate threats that would touch both user funds and Bitcoin’s economic model. Quantum Risk Moves Beyond Keys Duong said about one-third of the Bitcoin supply may be structurally exposed because their public keys are already visible on the blockchain. That figure is close to 33%, or about 6.51 million BTC, held in address types where public keys are revealed and could, in theory, be derived into private keys by a powerful enough quantum computer. Reports have highlighted that this exposure comes mostly from address reuse and older wallet formats. Experts Say Two Main Technical Threats Exist One threat is to signatures. Quantum algorithms such as Shor’s could, at scale, recover private keys from public keys, letting attackers sign transactions and drain funds. The second is a possible mining problem: a sufficiently fast quantum miner might find proofs of work much faster than classic rigs, upsetting incentives and block production. Duong and others stress the signature risk is nearer-term in theory, because it only requires cracking signatures tied to revealed public keys. What The Industry Is Doing Based on reports , the conversation has already reached fund managers and standards bodies. Some institutional filings have started to flag quantum risk, and NIST and other bodies are pushing work on post-quantum cryptography for broader systems. Engineers in the crypto space are looking at migration paths that would swap in quantum-resistant schemes, though any such change to Bitcoin would be complex and would require wide agreement. A Long-Term Problem, Not An Immediate One Duong and other commentators note that today’s quantum machines are far too small and noisy to crack Bitcoin’s cryptography. The warnings are about a possible future point often called “Q-day,” when a machine large and stable enough could run Shor’s and related algorithms at scale. Timelines vary widely among experts; some expect decades, others say the gap is shrinking faster than many predicted. According to industry sources, coins that remain in addresses that have already allowed vulnerability of public keys are the most exposed if a well-architectured quantum machine is deployed. That makes best practices — like avoiding address reuse and moving old balances to fresh, quantum-resistant addresses once those are available — sensible steps. But there is no simple, one-click fix for the whole ecosystem, experts say.

The move places the alleged kingpin behind a multibillion-dollar “pig butchering” network directly into China’s criminal justice system, raising questions about how Beijing will prosecute one of the most complex transnational crypto cases to date. Cambodia Hands Over Chen Zhi After Revoking Citizenship Cambodia China Times and statements from Cambodia’s Ministry of Interior stated that Chen Zhi, along with two associates, Xu Ji Liang and Shao Ji Hui, was arrested on January 6 following months of joint investigations by Cambodian and Chinese authorities. Beijing had desired the three to be deported to China. According to Cambodian authorities, the operation was conducted as a bilateral cooperation agreement that involved transnational crime. In December 2025, Chen had already been removed as the royal decree had revoked his Cambodian citizenship, paving the way. Chen, 38, has been the chairman and founder of Prince Group, a conglomerate that started its operations in Cambodia in the year 2015 and has interests in real estate, finance, and hospitality. Although the company was publicly a legitimate regional company, U.S. and U.K. authorities have alleged that it was a cover to facilitate a massive criminal network, which they claim was developed through online frauds, money laundering, and forced labor. Prince Group has refuted all the allegations. The deportation is possible after the enforcement efforts by the United States in October , when the federal prosecutors sought to seize over 127,000 bitcoin they claimed was tied to wallets operated by Chen and his network. @USTreasury has moved to make its largest-ever cryptocurrency seizure, targeting $12B in #Bitcoin from a global ""pig butchering"" scam. #US #PigButchering https://t.co/6JpciJNrod — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 By that point, the Bitcoin was worth approximately 15 billion dollars, which is the biggest cryptocurrency seizure to date associated with the use of online fraud. The U.S. Treasury and the U.K. government had jointly described Prince Group as a transnational criminal group, and U.S. sanctions had been extended to dozens of crypto wallets containing hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin. After Deportation, Chinese Courts Set to Handle Global Crypto Fraud Case The schemes, commonly known as pig-butchering scams , involved building trust with victims before directing them to fake crypto trading platforms. Once funds were deposited, the platforms disappeared. Investigators say the proceeds were funneled through more than 100 shell companies, crypto exchanges, and mining operations before being consolidated into private Bitcoin wallets. The case now takes a new turn with Chen being back in China. The Chinese law enables the authorities to prosecute the citizens in case a serious crime was committed abroad, especially when it dealt with a massive fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking. Even though the official charges are not yet declared, Chinese courts in the past have sentenced very harshly in similar cases, such as life imprisonment, and in extreme cases involving violence or forced labor, the death penalty. Asset forfeiture is also anticipated by the Chinese authorities. Coordination with foreign governments is likely, given that U.S. officials have already seized billions of dollars in Bitcoin connected to the case. Those assets could ultimately be used for victim compensation if courts approve such measures. The arrest comes amid a broader global crackdown on crypto-enabled fraud networks operating across Southeast Asia. Over the past year, regulators and law enforcement agencies have worked with major crypto firms to freeze and recover illicit funds . @Tether_to , @chainalysis , @binance , and @OKX have worked with APAC law enforcement to freeze $49.6M in USDT traced to a global “pig butchering” scam ring. #Tether #pigbutchering https://t.co/30UEbMdTja — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 28, 2025 Tether, Binance, Coinbase, and blockchain analytics firms have all assisted in tracing and blocking assets tied to pig-butchering scams.

This development comes amid BTC’s rally above $90,000, with the flagship crypto now targeting new 2026 highs. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs See Over $800 Million In Inflows SoSoValue data shows that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs saw over $800 million in daily net inflows on January 5. The BTC ETFs took in $697.25 million, led by BlackRock and Fidelity’s fund. This inflow was notably the largest since the October 10 crypto crash, marking a huge positive for the Bitcoin price. Notably, BTC has reached a 2026 high above $94,000 amid these inflows, with sustained demand likely contributing to higher prices. Furthermore, the Ethereum ETFs recorded daily net inflows of $168.13 million, building on the $174.43 million inflows on January 2. The net inflows recorded on January 2 were the largest since December 9. These inflows of the ETH ETFs come as ETH staking demand rises, with the staking entry queue now over 200x larger than the staking exit queue. This is significant as the institutional and staking demand could both contribute to a supply shock for the ETH price. Meanwhile, just like the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETFs also recorded significant inflows on January 5. These funds took in $46.10 million on the day, marking their highest flows in the last month. It is worth noting that these XRP funds have not recorded daily net outflows since they launched in November. This has likely contributed to XRP’s outperformance following Bitcoin’s rally above $90,000 to start the year. The altcoin currently boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 20%, outperforming all crypto assets in the top 10 ranking except Dogecoin. “Coming Into 2026 Like A Lion” In an X post , Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the Bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion. This came as he noted that they had taken in over $1.2 billion in the first two trading days of the year, with every fund seeing considerable flows. Based on this, the Bloomberg analyst noted that they are on pace to take $150 billion in inflows in 2026. “If they can take in $22b when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining,” he added. Meanwhile, Balchunas stated that the total 2026 flows for these Bitcoin ETFs will depend on price. Although he noted it wasn’t a formal prediction, the Bloomberg analyst mentioned that they could take in between $20 and $70 billion in inflows if the BTC price underperforms. On the other hand, if BTC rises to around $130,000 and $140,000, Balchunas believes that the ETFs could record up to $70 billion in inflows this year.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|BlackRock|Bloomberg|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Eric Balchunas|Ethereum|Ethereum Spot ETFs|Fidelity|XRP|XRP Spot ETFs|Year-To-Date|YTD,BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

I recommend avoiding GBTC in favor of lower-cost alternatives like IBIT for Bitcoin ETF exposure. Current accumulation trends and exhausted long-term holder selling suggest a prudent 1–2% portfolio allocation at current Bitcoin levels. Rising derivatives leverage increases volatility risk, supporting only a modest allocation to avoid shocks from potential liquidations. Intro & Thesis The investment manager Grayscale markets several interesting products within the digital asset industry. In today's article, I will focus on one of its flagship products: the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). This ETF is an exchange-traded fund that offers direct exposure to the spot price of Bitcoin, removing the risk of self-custody for investors. This is because Grayscale itself operates with authorized custodians, who perform this custodial function within their security vaults. When an investor buys the GBTC ETF, what they are doing is buying shares in a fund that acquires Bitcoin. That is its objective: to passively replicate the performance of the spot price of Bitcoin, after deducting the fees charged by the fund itself for exposure to the asset. From my point of view, today's thesis is to buy the ETF, supported by the evolution of holder behavior and the positioning of the derivatives market. Bitcoin set its all-time high (ATH) in October 2025, at a level close to $126,000. After that, the price of the asset corrected to around $84,000, defending it strongly and establishing a current price close to $93,000, marking an approximate drop of 29% from its all-time high. In my opinion, this reduces the entry risk, as we have passed a moment of euphoria and are currently experiencing a moment of fear in the market. Therefore, seeing the behavior indicators stabilizing and beginning to rebound from low levels, I interpret that we are in a market consolidation environment. That said, when we look at leverage in the derivatives market, we can see a situation of relative fragility, so I recommend buying in stages. I suggest making an initial partial purchase of 1–2% of the portfolio and only adding to it if the improvement in the indicators analyzed is confirmed. The use of GBTC as the main ticker in the article is motivated by the fact that it was the first product to be exposed to the spot price of Bitcoin, initially designed to function as a trust. With the wave of ETF approvals, the GBTC product transitioned to an ETP product, aligning itself with other products such as IBIT (Blackrock) or ARKB (Ark Invest) in terms of behavior and characteristics. In the ETF Overview section, we will see how these products compare in terms of costs, which is a relevant variable when choosing an ETF. ETF Overview Fund Website In the previous image we can observe the comparison in terms of returns of the ETF analyzed (differentiated between NAV and market price) and its benchmark, which is the Bitcoin asset. At 1 month the market price has fallen by 17.45% against 16.89% of the benchmark, and 17.00% of the NAV. This indicates that the directional tracking error is positive, since it replicates the return on the asset well, although it is negative and also indicates that the beta of the asset can play in favor of the investor if the rebound occurs that we have discussed in the previous section. We can also see, as in the long term there is a certain friction between the price of the ETF and its NAV (43.36% (NAV) and 42.02% (price)), which is magnified over time. Seeking Alpha Next, we compare several ETFs that have the same objective (search for Bitcoin exposure), such as GBTC, IBIT, BITB, FBTC or ARKB. As can be seen in the picture, GBTC has an expense ratio of 1.50%, which is far from the expense ratio of the other ETFs, which in turn have an associated cost in the range of 0.20 to 0.25% per year. That is why, at a cost level, the ETF analyzed is not the most suitable fund to replicate the Bitcoin asset, so I would recommend buying one of the alternatives proposed here, such as IBIT, which is the ETF of Blackrock. Having cheaper alternatives, I completely rule out exposing myself to Bitcoin through the GBTC ETF. Behaviour Status Node Analytica When establishing our thesis, we will focus on analyzing the behavior of different market players. In the image above, we can see the Accumulation Trend Score metric, which measures the level of Bitcoin accumulation by the different holders participating in it. In the period after the 2025 high, we can see recurring episodes of the score rebounding in areas of consolidation, which suggests to me that there is an absorption of supply. For the thesis, this is key because it supports the idea that the movement from 126k to 84k has not led to a persistent distribution regime. On the contrary, the signal has begun to behave as in transition phases where the market is replacing impulsive sales with more patient purchases. In this context, it makes sense for me to make a partial entry (1–2% of portfolio), as it is justified as positioning in an area where marginal demand is reappearing, without assuming that the absolute minimum has already been confirmed. Node Analytica If we look at the same indicator, broken down, analyzing the historical behavior of the cohorts, we can draw the following conclusions. Visually, we can see that the colored bands do not move in unison. There are some periods where small cohorts show more alternation (more mixed colors), while in certain sections there are more continuous blocks of intense blue in other cohorts, which is usually interpreted as episodes of more persistent accumulation. Currently, we can see how the trend is reversing in some cohorts and, as a result, Bitcoin is beginning to accumulate (see the 1k - 10k and +10k cohorts). This situation increases the possibility of a price rebound in the medium term and may therefore confirm the thesis put forward in this article. checkonchain The chart above measures the net supply flow of long-term holders, where the red bars refer to episodes of distribution (reduction in exposure) and the blue bars refer to accumulation (increase in exposure). The image shows a prolonged phase dominated by red, with a particularly intense episode of selling towards the end of the period, coinciding with a weak price environment. After this episode, we can see how the indicator has been approaching a neutral situation, which is usually interpreted as an exhaustion of structural selling pressure. This does not mean that there will be a price rebound, but it does partially support my proposal for a partial purchase in the current zone, since if you buy, you would not be buying on FOMO, but at a point where the data suggests that long-term selling may have done much of the work, and where the next leg will depend more on confirmations (derivatives) than on a continued outflow of LTH supply. Derivatives Perspectives checkonchain To recap and conclude my presentation, we will now analyze Bitcoin's derivatives leverage ratio. Looking ahead, this chart helps us frame the “how” and ‘when’ of the proposed thesis, not just the “why.” We can see how the leverage ratio (derivatives leverage relative to capitalization) has been on an upward trend since 2023, accelerating particularly in 2024 and 2025, with growth also accompanying open interest. At this point, we can say that even if the spot price of the asset re-enters an accumulation phase, the market is based on derivatives that have grown significantly, which increases the likelihood that the next stage will follow a “ladder” pattern, with price advances followed by violent leverage resets (liquidations), before resuming the aforementioned trend. That is why I only recommend an allocation of 1-2% of the portfolio, to avoid any shocks caused by the derivatives market.

A notable recent trend has been Bitcoin’s steady decline in market dominance since summer . Historically, this pattern often signals capital shifting toward altcoins. That means tokens like XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana could be the biggest winners in the year ahead. XRP (XRP): The Global Payments Leader Could Hit New Highs in Q1 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) remains the biggest blockchain player in international payments, thanks to fast settlement speeds and minimal transaction costs. Built for institutional finance, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) provides a modern, cost-efficient alternative to legacy systems such as SWIFT. XRP’s real-world use case has been highlighted in reports from organizations including the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. XRP is now the third-largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency, with a market valuation above $134 billion. Following the resolution of Ripple’s lengthy court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission early last year, XRP climbed to a new seven-year high of $3.65. Since then, the price has retraced around 39% and currently trades near $2.22. Over the past week, XRP surged r19%, driven by the launch of five U.S.-listed spot XRP ETFs, which opened the door for significant institutional participation. If additional ETF approvals arrive alongside clearer regulatory guidance, some analysts believe XRP could reach as high as $5 by the end of Q1 with $10 being a stretch target for the year. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Blockchain Targeting a Move to New ATH Soon Solana ($SOL) is one of the world’s leading smart-contract networks. Recognized for lightning-fast transactions and extremely low fees, it commands a market cap of around $71 billion and $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Recently approved Solana spot ETFs from issuers such as Grayscale and Bitwise could unlock additional institutional inflows, much like the wave of capital that previously supported Bitcoin and Ethereum. After dipping toward $100 earlier in the year, SOL has recovered to around $136 and is currently trading near a key technical support range. SOL is trading high its 30-day moving average, suggesting a possible short-term rebound back toward $130 by the weekend. This would give it a strong launchpad as it eyes its next major resistance level near $250. A breakout could propel Solana towards its previous all-time high of $293.31 by the end of the quarter, with some analysts suggesting it could hit $500 this year. Beyond price trends, Solana is rapidly becoming the preferred blockchain for tokenizing real-world assets (RWA). Global financial giants including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have already chosen Solana to launch tokenized investment products. Dogecoin (DOGE): Will The World’s Favourite Meme Coin Finally Hit $1 Original meme coin Dogecoin ($DOGE) was first released in 2013 and continues to thrive thanks to its passionate “Doge Army.” Despite its humorous origins, DOGE commands an eye watering market cap around $25 billion, making it no laughing matter. The token’s explosive rise in 2021, boosted by influential figures such as Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, cemented Dogecoin as one of the most recognizable brands in crypto. Although created as a joke, Dogecoin’s substantial market base has helped moderate price volatility. The token often trends alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The popular rallying cry “Dogecoin to $1” remains alive and well, though reaching that milestone in 2026 may be difficult without supportive U.S. crypto policy changes. A major regulatory breakthrough, such as the Trump administration advancing Project Crypto, could fuel a sharp move from $0.15 toward $0.45 as early as spring. Adoption continues to expand. Tesla accepts DOGE for selected merchandise purchases, while major platforms including PayPal and Revolut facilitate Dogecoin transactions. DOGE’s record high of $0.7316, set in 2021, still remains distant, with the coin currently sitting around 80% below that peak. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 One emerging project still flying under the radar is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 solution. Despite the playful branding, the platform is serious about delivering ultra-fast throughput, minimal fees, and advanced smart-contract functionality to the Bitcoin network. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER integrates decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge to simplify Bitcoin transfers across multiple blockchains. The presale has already raised more than $30 million, and some market commentators believe the token could deliver up to 100× gains when it lists on exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit reported no security vulnerabilities, an encouraging sign for cautious investors. HYPER tokens support network fees, governance voting, and staking rewards. Those who stake today can earn up to 38% APY, although this rate declines as the staking pool grows. With the full platform rollout expected in 2026, both veteran Bitcoin users and newcomers have the opportunity to invest in a project that will bootstrap Bitcoin.

The financial institution filed the required paperwork to list both Solana and Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday. These are the first crypto-related products of this kind that they will bring to the U.S. market. Solana ETFs have attracted $801 million just 6 months after the first of these funds was launched country. The largest of these ETFs in terms of assets under management (AUM) continues to be Bitwise’s BSOL ETF with $730 million. Staking rewards are an attractive feature for investors. At the time of writing, BSOL’s staking yield sits at 6.75%. These rewards are added to the fund’s assets daily and should boost the price of the ETF in the long run. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Eyes $230 as Positive Momentum Accelerates Morgan Stanley’s decision to launch a Solana ETF gives this altcoin a strong credibility boost. It also provides further confirmation of Wall Street’s strong interest in tokens beyond Bitcoin. Source: TradingView In the past week, SOL has gained 9% and currently sits at $138. Meanwhile, trading volumes stand at $5.5 billion, accounting for 7% of the asset’s market cap. The daily price action shows that SOL broke out of a falling wedge pattern. This is a bullish setup that, once broken, commonly confirms a trend reversal. The near-term target for the token would be the $160 level, as the market will likely retest the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Meanwhile, if SOL surpasses its 200-day EMA, it may reach $200 quickly, aided by growing institutional demand on Wall Street. As interest in the Solana ecosystem keeps growing, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could eventually draw Wall Street’s attention as well. This is a powerful Solana-based Bitcoin L2 that will make it easier for BTC investors to earn passive income on their assets. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Leverages Solana’s Efficiency to Boost Bitcoin’s DeFi Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings real utility to Bitcoin by unlocking fast, low-cost DeFi through Solana’s high-speed infrastructure. With the Hyper Bridge , BTC holders can tap into the Hyper Layer 2 directly from the Bitcoin network, without ever giving up custody. That means lending, staking, and earning yield on BTC for the first time. As more Bitcoin flows into the Hyper L2, demand for $HYPER is set to surge. Investors have already poured in over $30 million, spotting the potential to revive Bitcoin’s ecosystem and open the door to true on-chain utility. To buy $HYPER before its presale ends, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or SOL for this token or use a traditional bank card to complete your purchase.

Over recent weeks, a combination of technical signals, governance decisions, and regulatory speculation has brought ADA back into focus. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bring The Heat: $1.2 Billion Flows In First 48 Hours—Analyst While optimism has returned to parts of the market, the network now faces a critical test: whether short-term recovery can translate into sustained progress across price, adoption, and infrastructure. ADA's price trends slightly upwards on low timeframes as seen on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Cardano’s (ADA) Technical Signals Suggest Improving Momentum Cardano’s price action has shown signs of stabilization following a decline of more than 60% in 2025. Currently, ADA formed its first golden cross of 2026, with short-term moving averages crossing above longer-term averages on both hourly and two-hour charts. ADA has also printed its first positive weekly candle in over two months, reflecting improving sentiment. At the time of writing, the token is trading around the $0.41–$0.416 range, supported by higher futures open interest and daily trading volume near recent highs. However, price remains capped by resistance near $0.401, a level that aligns with the 50-day moving average and has rejected multiple breakout attempts since late 2024. A sustained move above this zone is widely seen as necessary for further upside toward higher historical ranges. Governance Funding and Ecosystem Priorities Beyond charts, Cardano has taken steps to address ecosystem development through governance. A proposal authorizing the withdrawal of 70 million ADA for critical integrations has been ratified by the network’s governing bodies. The funding is intended to support infrastructure additions such as stablecoin integrations and oracle services, including work related to USDC, USDT, and Pyth. In parallel, the Cardano Foundation has allocated additional resources to boost stablecoin liquidity, a key requirement for competitive DeFi activity. Founder Charles Hoskinson has emphasized that future success will be measured less by short-term price movement and more by growth in metrics such as active users, total value locked, and real-world usage. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade and the planned expansion of the Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain, are central to this strategy. ETF Expectations and the 2026 Outlook Another factor shaping expectations is the prospect of a spot Cardano ETF in the United States. While no application has been approved as of December 2025, products such as the Grayscale Cardano ADA Trust remain under SEC review, with decisions now expected in early 2026. Previous approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have raised expectations, though analysts note that ADA faces additional scrutiny tied to classification debates.

This significant movement, tracked by blockchain analytics firm Onchain Lens, involved 3,040 BTC valued at $270 million and 61,359 ETH worth $190 million. Consequently, market analysts immediately began scrutinizing the implications of this substantial institutional action. BlackRock Bitcoin Withdrawal Analysis and Market Context BlackRock’s recent cryptocurrency movement represents one of the largest single institutional withdrawals recorded in 2025. The firm transferred these assets from exchange wallets to private custody solutions. Typically, such transfers indicate a strategic shift toward long-term holding rather than immediate trading. Moreover, this action follows BlackRock’s successful launch of its spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, which has accumulated substantial assets under management. Blockchain data reveals precise timing and execution details. Onchain Lens reported the transactions occurring between 2:00 AM and 10:00 AM UTC. The withdrawals originated from multiple exchange addresses and consolidated into newly created institutional custody wallets. Additionally, transaction patterns showed careful fee optimization and batch processing, suggesting sophisticated operational planning. Institutional Crypto Investment Patterns Financial institutions have developed distinct blockchain behavior patterns over recent years. Exchange withdrawals generally signal accumulation phases, while deposits often precede selling pressure. BlackRock’s action aligns with accumulation behavior observed among other major institutions throughout 2024. Furthermore, similar movements from Fidelity and Vanguard preceded extended holding periods averaging eighteen months according to CryptoQuant research. Several key indicators support the long-term holding interpretation: Cold Storage Transfers: Assets moved to wallets without exchange integration Timing Patterns: Execution during low-volume trading hours Transaction Structure: Batch processing with optimized fees Historical Precedent: Similar movements preceded extended holding periods Cryptocurrency Exchange Dynamics and Institutional Behavior Exchange balances serve as crucial liquidity indicators for cryptocurrency markets. When major institutions withdraw assets, available supply decreases on trading platforms. This reduction can potentially create upward price pressure during demand surges. Currently, exchange Bitcoin reserves sit at multi-year lows according to Glassnode data, representing just 11.8% of circulating supply. Recent Major Institutional Crypto Movements (2024-2025) Institution Asset Amount Date Interpretation BlackRock BTC/ETH $460M March 2025 Long-term accumulation Fidelity BTC $210M February 2025 ETF reserve building MicroStrategy BTC $370M January 2025 Corporate treasury addition Grayscale ETH $180M December 2024 Trust rebalancing Market analysts monitor these movements closely. Exchange net flows provide valuable sentiment indicators. Positive net flows (deposits exceeding withdrawals) often signal distribution phases. Conversely, negative net flows typically indicate accumulation. The cryptocurrency market currently shows sustained negative exchange flows for fourteen consecutive weeks according to CryptoQuant metrics. Bitcoin ETF Impact on Institutional Strategy Spot Bitcoin ETFs revolutionized institutional cryptocurrency access since their January 2024 approval. These financial products created regulated pathways for traditional investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerged as the largest fund by assets within six months of launch. ETF structures require underlying asset custody, which explains part of BlackRock’s withdrawal activity. ETF operations involve complex logistical considerations. Authorized participants must source Bitcoin for creation units. Providers often maintain exchange relationships for liquidity management. However, long-term holdings typically migrate to specialized custody solutions. This operational reality explains why major withdrawals frequently follow ETF inflows. Ethereum Institutional Demand and Market Structure BlackRock’s substantial Ethereum withdrawal warrants particular attention. The 61,359 ETH movement represents significant institutional interest beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 created new institutional appeal. Staking rewards provide yield generation opportunities unavailable with Bitcoin. Consequently, institutions increasingly view Ethereum as a dual-purpose asset. Ethereum’s exchange balance dynamics differ from Bitcoin’s pattern. Exchange ETH supply decreased 28% since the Merge according to Nansen data. This reduction reflects growing staking participation and institutional custody. Furthermore, Ethereum’s upcoming protocol upgrades continue attracting sophisticated investors. The network’s roadmap includes scalability improvements and enhanced security features. Several factors drive institutional Ethereum adoption: Staking Economics: 3-5% annual yield from network participation Protocol Development: Continuous upgrades enhancing utility DeFi Integration: Foundation for decentralized finance applications Regulatory Clarity: Improving classification frameworks globally Cryptocurrency Custody Evolution Institutional custody solutions matured significantly since 2020. Early solutions offered basic storage with limited functionality. Modern platforms provide sophisticated services including staking, delegation, and governance participation. BlackRock reportedly utilizes multiple custody providers according to industry sources. This diversification strategy mitigates counterparty risk while optimizing operational efficiency. Custody technology advanced through several generations. First-generation solutions focused primarily on security isolation. Second-generation platforms added financial service integrations. Current third-generation systems enable seamless movement between trading, custody, and staking environments. This technological progress facilitates large-scale institutional operations like BlackRock’s recent movement. Market Impact and Future Implications BlackRock’s withdrawal immediately affected market microstructure. Exchange order books showed reduced liquidity at key price levels following the movement. However, broader price action remained relatively stable, suggesting efficient market absorption. This stability indicates growing market depth and institutional participation according to Kaiko research analysis. Long-term implications extend beyond immediate price effects. Institutional holding patterns influence market cycles significantly. Extended holding reduces circulating supply, potentially amplifying price movements during demand increases. Historical analysis shows similar accumulation phases preceded major bull markets in 2017 and 2021. Current institutional behavior suggests preparation for extended holding periods. Several market indicators support this interpretation: Hodler Net Position Change: Consistently positive for 18 months Exchange Reserve Ratios: At lowest levels since 2018 Institutional Flow Data: Sustained accumulation across products Futures Market Structure: Healthy contango without excessive leverage Regulatory Environment Considerations Regulatory developments continue shaping institutional cryptocurrency strategies. The United States made significant progress toward clearer frameworks in 2024. Legislative proposals address custody requirements and market structure issues. Meanwhile, international jurisdictions advanced their regulatory approaches. The European Union implemented comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations last year. BlackRock operates within evolving regulatory parameters. The firm maintains rigorous compliance protocols across all cryptocurrency activities. Regulatory considerations influence custody selection, reporting requirements, and operational procedures. These factors partially explain the timing and structure of recent withdrawals according to compliance specialists familiar with institutional operations. Conclusion BlackRock’s substantial Bitcoin and Ethereum withdrawal represents a strategic institutional movement with broader market implications. The $460 million transfer from exchanges to custody solutions signals confidence in long-term cryptocurrency value. This action aligns with growing institutional adoption patterns observed throughout 2024 and early 2025. Furthermore, the movement reflects sophisticated operational capabilities and regulatory compliance. Market participants will continue monitoring similar institutional behavior for insights into cryptocurrency market development. Ultimately, BlackRock’s Bitcoin withdrawal demonstrates maturing institutional infrastructure and strategic positioning within digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: Why do institutions withdraw cryptocurrency from exchanges? Institutions typically withdraw cryptocurrencies from exchanges to secure assets in private custody solutions for long-term holding, risk management, and regulatory compliance purposes. Exchange withdrawals reduce counterparty risk and signal accumulation intentions. Q2: How does BlackRock’s withdrawal affect Bitcoin and Ethereum prices? Large withdrawals reduce immediate selling pressure and exchange liquidity, potentially creating upward price momentum during demand increases. However, sophisticated markets often price in such movements efficiently, resulting in limited immediate volatility. Q3: What tools do analysts use to track institutional cryptocurrency movements? Blockchain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Nansen provide institutional flow tracking through address clustering, exchange flow analysis, and wallet behavior pattern recognition. Q4: How does this withdrawal relate to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF? Spot Bitcoin ETFs require underlying asset custody. BlackRock’s withdrawal likely represents operational movement between exchange liquidity pools and long-term custody solutions supporting ETF creation and redemption processes. Q5: What percentage of circulating Bitcoin supply do institutions currently hold? Institutional entities including corporations, ETFs, and funds currently hold approximately 8-12% of circulating Bitcoin supply according to multiple analytics firms, with percentages increasing steadily since 2020.

56955727,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259544,1767833711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Altcoin Season Index Stagnates at 23, Revealing Bitcoin’s Unwavering Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-holds-23/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Stagnates at 23, Revealing Bitcoin’s Unwavering Dominance As of late March 2025, the cryptocurrency market’s pulse, measured by CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, remains steady at a low 23. This critical metric, unchanged from the previous day, delivers a clear and data-driven message: the digital asset landscape continues to operate firmly under Bitcoin’s shadow. For investors and analysts, this persistent reading underscores a market phase where capital and sentiment overwhelmingly favor the original cryptocurrency, raising questions about the timing and triggers for a potential rotation. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Market Barometer CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index functions as a quantitative market barometer. It systematically compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets, against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The methodology is straightforward yet powerful. The index calculates the percentage of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin. Consequently, a reading above 75 triggers an official “altcoin season” declaration, indicating widespread altcoin strength. Conversely, the current score of 23 sits far from this threshold, firmly placing the market in what analysts term a “Bitcoin season.” This index provides more than a simple snapshot. It offers historical context for market cycles. For instance, during the bull market of late 2020 and early 2021, the index repeatedly breached the 75 level, signaling frenzied altcoin rallies. In contrast, periods of market consolidation or risk-off sentiment often see the index languish below 50. The steadfast hold at 23 suggests a market characterized by caution, where investors perceive Bitcoin as the primary store of value and safe-haven asset within the volatile crypto space. Bitcoin Season: Drivers and Market Implications The prolonged Bitcoin season, indicated by the low index score, stems from several interconnected factors. Firstly, macroeconomic conditions continue to influence capital allocation. In times of perceived economic uncertainty or tightening monetary policy, investors historically flock to assets with proven resilience. Bitcoin, with its longer track record and massive liquidity, often fulfills this role within the crypto ecosystem, drawing capital away from smaller, riskier altcoins. Secondly, the maturation of institutional investment channels has disproportionately benefited Bitcoin. The approval and subsequent inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have created a consistent, institutional-grade demand vector that most altcoins lack. This structural demand supports Bitcoin’s price floor and dominance. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected in April 2024, continues to cast a long shadow, with many investors positioning in anticipation of its historical impact on Bitcoin’s supply dynamics, thereby sidelining altcoin investments. The implications for traders and portfolio managers are significant: Risk Assessment: A low index suggests higher relative risk in altcoin allocations. Capital Rotation Watch: Analysts monitor for a sustained rise above 50 as an early signal of shifting sentiment. Niche Performance: Even during Bitcoin seasons, specific sectors like Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) or Real-World Assets (RWA) may outperform, though they fail to lift the aggregate index. Expert Analysis on Market Structure Market analysts point to on-chain data to support the index’s narrative. Bitcoin’s dominance chart, which measures its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, has remained elevated, often correlating inversely with the Altcoin Season Index. Additionally, liquidity analysis shows deeper order books and lower slippage on major Bitcoin pairs compared to most altcoins, reinforcing its status as the market’s base currency. This environment creates a “wait-and-see” approach among altcoin investors, who may be accumulating positions in anticipation of a future season shift rather than driving immediate price appreciation. Historical Precedents and Future Catalysts Examining past cycles provides context for the current stagnation. Historically, prolonged Bitcoin seasons have eventually given way to altcoin rallies, often triggered by a period of Bitcoin price stability or consolidation after a major run-up. Once Bitcoin’s price establishes a strong, steady range, speculative capital typically seeks higher beta opportunities in the altcoin market. Other catalysts have included breakthrough technological developments in specific altcoin sectors, major protocol upgrades, or a surge in decentralized application user activity that diverts attention from pure monetary assets. For the index to climb meaningfully from 23, a broad-based rally across multiple altcoin sectors is necessary. This requires a change in market psychology from risk-aversion to risk-seeking. Potential triggers on the horizon include clearer regulatory frameworks for altcoins beyond Bitcoin, which could reduce perceived regulatory risk, or a surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) across major decentralized finance ecosystems, signaling renewed utility-driven demand. Altcoin Season Index Thresholds and Market Phases Index Range Market Phase Interpretation Typical Investor Sentiment 0-24 Strong Bitcoin Season Extreme caution towards altcoins, flight to safety 25-49 Moderate Bitcoin Season Selective altcoin accumulation, majority Bitcoin focus 50-74 Transition / Neutral Balanced portfolios, watching for rotation signals 75-100 Altcoin Season High risk appetite, aggressive altcoin allocation Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index holding firm at 23 serves as a sobering reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring primacy in the current market cycle. This data point, reflecting the performance of the top 100 altcoins, confirms a landscape still dominated by the pioneer cryptocurrency. While this environment presents challenges for altcoin investors seeking immediate outsized returns, it also provides a period for due diligence and strategic accumulation. Market participants will watch for a sustained upward movement in the Altcoin Season Index as the primary technical signal that capital is beginning its historic rotation, potentially heralding the next phase of broader crypto market growth. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 23 mean? It means that only an estimated 23% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90-day period. The market is far from the 75% threshold needed to declare an “altcoin season,” indicating Bitcoin’s strong relative performance. Q2: Who creates the Altcoin Season Index and how often is it updated? CoinMarketCap calculates and publishes the Altcoin Season Index. The index updates daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins based on rolling 90-day performance data. Q3: Can the market be in an altcoin season even if the index is below 75? No, by the index’s specific definition, an “altcoin season” is only officially declared when the score sustains a reading above 75. Scores below this indicate varying degrees of Bitcoin dominance or a neutral market. Q4: Does a low index score mean all altcoins are performing poorly? Not necessarily. It indicates that less than a quarter of the major altcoins are beating Bitcoin. Some individual altcoins or specific sectors may still post significant gains, but they are the exception, not the rule, during such periods. Q5: What is the main utility of this index for a cryptocurrency investor? The index provides a macro, data-driven tool for assessing overall market risk appetite and capital rotation. It helps investors understand whether the market environment favors the relative safety of Bitcoin or the higher-risk, higher-reward potential of altcoins, informing asset allocation decisions.

56955847,https://timestabloid.com/?p=94316,1767834016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Cardano (ADA) Set to Explode. Analyst Sets Bullish Price Targets,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-set-to-explode-analyst-sets-bullish-price-targets/,timestabloid,"Recent market analysis indicates that Cardano (ADA) may be positioned for further upward movement following its year-to-date gains. The cryptocurrency has advanced by over 23% in early 2026, reflecting a broader recovery across the digital asset market. A January 6 analysis on TradingView by a pseudonymous commentator highlights two primary factors supporting a potential continuation of this rally. ADA Maintains Critical Support Levels A central factor in the bullish outlook is ADA’s ability to hold a multi-month demand zone near $0.35. This area has acted as a strong support level since December 2025, cushioning the cryptocurrency during periods of weakness and facilitating subsequent upward bounces. According to the analysis, Cardano recently rebounded from this zone to reach $0.40 before experiencing a minor correction. The commentator notes that although ADA broke below an ascending channel in November 2025 during a bearish phase, the long-term support near $0.35 has remained intact. Multiple technical indicators in this area suggest a high probability of further upward momentum, indicating that the cryptocurrency could aim for significantly higher price levels if the support holds. Liquidity Clusters Suggest Further Gains The analyst also highlighted visible liquidity clusters above ADA’s current price, which often act as short-term magnets for asset movement. These clusters represent areas where orders accumulate, and market participants frequently drive prices toward these levels before executing larger moves. In this context, the analysis predicts that Cardano is likely to continue its advance to capture these liquidity pockets. The commentator also identified the specific price ranges for potential take-profit targets: the first at $0.44, followed by $0.50 to $0.55, and $0.60 to $0.65. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analysis also identifies a maximum target range between $0.73 and $0.78, which represents roughly a 78% to 90% increase from current trading levels. The analyst cautions that a drop below $0.245 would invalidate the bullish thesis, as this would break the structural support of the channel and suggest a weakening of the overall trend. Dependence on Broader Market Stability Cardano’s potential upside is closely linked to the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Significant declines in these assets could limit ADA’s ability to sustain gains. Additionally, the analysis notes that Cardano could benefit from capital rotation within the altcoin market. Recent trends indicate that layer 1 tokens and large-cap cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin, creating favorable conditions for investors to shift toward assets like ADA in search of higher returns. Cardano’s ability to hold critical support near $0.35 and its proximity to key liquidity clusters support the case for further price appreciation. The outlined take-profit levels, combined with careful attention to market conditions in Bitcoin and Ethereum, provide a framework for evaluating ADA’s potential rally. While risks remain, the technical setup suggests that Cardano could continue targeting higher prices from current levels if structural support and broader market stability persist.

56957012,654820,1767834052,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56957012.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Most Reactive Investors Are Still Selling At A Loss – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-most-reactive-investors-are-still-selling/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin is holding above the $90,000 level after briefly testing resistance near $94,000, a move that has provided short-term relief but stopped short of confirming a renewed uptrend. While price action suggests buyers are defending key psychological support, momentum remains fragile, and analysts are increasingly focused on on-chain signals to assess whether this consolidation can evolve into a sustainable recovery. According to top analyst Darkfost, one of the most informative indicators in the current environment is the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR). To avoid misleading short-term fluctuations, Darkfost emphasizes the importance of monitoring the 30-day moving average of STH SOPR rather than the raw daily readings. This smoother view helps isolate structural shifts in behavior. At present, the indicator is recovering from a cycle low near 0.982 and is gradually approaching the neutral threshold of 1.0. That level marks the point at which short-term holders move from realizing losses to breaking even. This recovery suggests selling pressure from recent buyers may be easing. However, whether SOPR can reclaim and hold above neutral will likely determine if Bitcoin’s current consolidation resolves higher or gives way to renewed downside pressure. Short-Term Holders Still Under Pressure, Trend Confirmation Pending This metric tracks whether short-term holders—market participants who typically control a large share of daily trading volume—are realizing profits or losses when they move coins. Because these holders tend to react quickly to price changes and often provide exit liquidity, their behavior plays a decisive role in short-term market direction. According to Darkfost, short-term Bitcoin holders are still operating at a loss, despite the recent price stabilization above $90,000. This detail is critical for interpreting the current market phase. When STHs are underwater, selling pressure tends to persist in waves, but it also marks the zone where attractive risk-reward conditions often begin to form—provided broader structure holds. Historically, durable bullish trends do not emerge while short-term holders are consistently realizing losses. For momentum to shift decisively, this cohort must return to profitability. Once STHs move back into profit, behavior changes materially: panic selling fades, holding periods extend, and the market becomes less reactive to minor pullbacks. When this transition follows a capitulation phase, it has often preceded stronger upside continuation. However, Darkfost highlights a clear risk scenario. If STH SOPR approaches the neutral level around 1.0 and is rejected, it may signal that short-term participants are using break-even levels to exit positions. This behavior reflects lingering uncertainty rather than renewed confidence. Prolonged rejection below neutral has historically aligned with bear market conditions, where rallies fail to gain traction and sellers dominate rebounds. In this context, Bitcoin’s ability to sustain STH profitability becomes a key confirmation signal. Until that occurs, the market remains in a fragile balance—poised between recovery and renewed downside. Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Structure Remains Cautious Bitcoin is currently trading near the $92,000 area after rejecting higher levels, and the chart highlights a market attempting to stabilize following a sharp corrective phase. Price remains well below the prior cycle highs above $120,000, confirming that the broader trend has shifted from expansion into consolidation and distribution. From a technical perspective, BTC is trading below the short- and medium-term moving averages, which are now sloping downward. This configuration reflects persistent overhead supply and reinforces that rallies are still being sold into. The recent bounce from the $85,000–$88,000 zone shows that buyers are defending this area, but the lack of strong follow-through suggests demand remains fragile. The 200-day moving average continues to act as structural support below the price, currently near the mid-$80,000 range. As long as BTC holds above this level, the broader market structure avoids a deeper breakdown. However, price is also capped below former support around $95,000–$97,000, which has now flipped into resistance. Volume dynamics further support a cautious outlook. While sell pressure has moderated compared to the October breakdown, buying volume remains muted, indicating limited conviction from bulls. For momentum to improve meaningfully, Bitcoin would need a sustained reclaim of the $96,000–$100,000 zone. Until then, price action suggests a range-bound environment with elevated downside risk if support fails.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin analysis|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Realized Losses|Bitcoin STH|Bitcoin STH SOPR|btc|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

CEO Ki Young Ju’s recent assessment points to deep, institutional-led changes that are reshaping Bitcoin’s economic foundations, making a large-scale sell-off increasingly unlikely. This shift represents a potential maturation point for the flagship cryptocurrency, moving it away from the extreme volatility that characterized its earlier years. Bitcoin Sell-Off Unlikely Due to Structural Market Evolution The core argument from CryptoQuant’s leadership centers on a documented change in investor behavior. Historically, Bitcoin markets experienced severe drawdowns, often exceeding 80% from all-time highs, driven by retail panic and leveraged speculation. However, current data reveals a different narrative. Institutional entities and large-scale holders now demonstrate a pronounced tendency toward long-term accumulation and holding, fundamentally altering market liquidity and sell pressure dynamics. This behavioral shift creates a more stable price floor and reduces systemic risk. Furthermore, the channels through which capital enters the Bitcoin ecosystem have diversified significantly. Capital no longer flows through a single, predictable conduit. Instead, it arrives via multiple pathways including Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries, sovereign wealth fund considerations, and traditional finance vehicles. This diversification makes timing market inflows a futile exercise and, more importantly, ensures a more consistent and resilient liquidity base. The market’s structure itself has evolved to be more robust. Institutional Holdings as a Defensive Bulwark A critical component of this new stability is the role of massive, static Bitcoin holdings. Ki Young Ju specifically highlighted the strategic position of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds approximately 673,000 BTC. This colossal stash, valued in the tens of billions, operates under a clear, long-term corporate strategy. The firm consistently communicates its intent to hold Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, not a trading instrument. Consequently, this supply is effectively locked away from the daily market, removing it as a source of potential selling pressure. Instead of posing a threat, these institutional reserves function as a defensive mechanism. Their presence on the balance sheets of public companies acts as a public commitment to Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This visibility discourages aggressive short-selling and provides psychological support during market downturns. The table below contrasts traditional versus new market dynamics: Traditional Bitcoin Market (Pre-2020) Current Structural Market (Post-2024) Dominance of retail & speculative capital Significant institutional & long-term capital Concentrated liquidity channels (exchanges) Diversified liquidity (ETFs, trusts, direct custody) Large holdings frequently traded Mega-holdings (e.g., MicroStrategy) treated as strategic reserves Cyclical 80%+ drawdowns from ATH Potential drawdowns capped at ~50% from ATH High correlation to retail sentiment cycles Growing correlation to macro liquidity & institutional flows The Liquidity Dispersion Phenomenon Ju’s analysis introduces a nuanced observation about current global liquidity. He notes that present market liquidity appears dispersed into traditional assets like equities and gold, rather than being concentrated in Bitcoin. This might seem bearish at first glance, but it actually supports the thesis of reduced sell-off risk. It indicates that Bitcoin is not currently the target of excessive, “hot money” speculative inflows that can exit just as quickly. The capital within Bitcoin is, by comparison, more patient. This dispersion also suggests that when liquidity cycles eventually rotate back toward alternative stores of value, Bitcoin stands to benefit from a fresh, non-speculative inflow. The asset is building its foundation during a period of relative calm, not during a manic phase. This sets the stage for more sustainable growth, as the baseline of holders is solidified by conviction rather than short-term profit motives. Implications for Future Price Action and Volatility Based on these structural shifts, CryptoQuant’s CEO projects a significant departure from historical bear market patterns. The era of Bitcoin falling 80% or more from its peak may be over. The new paradigm, supported by on-chain data showing illiquid supply hitting record highs, suggests a maximum downside volatility in the range of 50% from all-time highs during corrective phases. This represents a halving of potential downside risk compared to previous cycles. The immediate forecast points toward a period of consolidation or sideways movement for several months. This is typical of markets undergoing structural change, as new support levels are established and volatility compresses. Such a phase allows weaker hands to exit and stronger, long-term holders to increase their positions, further cementing the stability of the network. Key indicators to watch include: Exchange Reserves: Continued outflow from exchanges to private custody signals long-term holding intent. Illiquid Supply Shock: The ratio of illiquid to liquid supply indicates how much BTC is effectively off the market. Entity-Adjusted Dormancy: Measures the average age of coins moved, with higher values suggesting older, likely institutional coins are remaining stationary. This analysis is grounded in verifiable on-chain metrics, not speculation. Firms like CryptoQuant track the movement of Bitcoin between wallets categorized as belonging to exchanges, miners, institutions, and long-term holders. The persistent trend of coins leaving exchange-controlled wallets for cold storage is one of the strongest empirical signals supporting the “sell-off unlikely” thesis. Conclusion The assertion that a large-scale Bitcoin sell-off is now unlikely marks a potential inflection point in the asset’s history. The structural changes identified by CryptoQuant’s CEO—driven by institutional adoption, diversified liquidity, and strategic long-term holding—are creating a more resilient market architecture. While volatility remains inherent to cryptocurrency, the extreme downside risks of the past appear to be mitigated by this new foundation. Bitcoin’s evolution from a speculative tech asset to a recognized macro store of value is actively reshaping its price dynamics, making catastrophic collapse scenarios far less probable than in any previous cycle. FAQs Q1: What does “structural change” mean for the Bitcoin market? A1: It refers to a fundamental shift in the types of investors (from retail to institutional) and their behavior (from trading to long-term holding), which alters how capital flows in and out, creating a more stable market base. Q2: Why is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holding so significant? A2: MicroStrategy’s ~673,000 BTC is held as a corporate treasury asset under a declared long-term strategy. This massive amount is effectively removed from daily trading supply, acting as a permanent reduction in sellable Bitcoin and setting a precedent for other institutions. Q3: How does diversified liquidity make Bitcoin more stable? A3: When money enters via many routes (ETFs, direct purchase, trusts) instead of just exchanges, it represents different investor time horizons and goals. This prevents a single point of failure and ensures outflows from one channel can be offset by stability in others. Q4: Does this mean Bitcoin will no longer have bear markets? A4: No, bear markets and corrections will still occur. However, their severity is likely to be less extreme. The analysis suggests drawdowns may be limited to around 50% from highs, rather than the 80%+ seen in cycles like 2018 and 2014-2015. Q5: What is the “liquidity dispersion” mentioned, and is it bad for Bitcoin? A5: Liquidity dispersion means investment capital is currently flowing into assets like stocks and gold more than Bitcoin. This is not necessarily bad; it indicates Bitcoin is not in a speculative bubble fueled by easy money. It can lead to more sustainable growth when the cycle eventually turns.

While such an outcome remains hypothetical, recent commentary from industry figures has renewed debate about the regulatory future of cryptocurrencies and their possible role within the global banking system. The discussion gained attention after Jake Claver, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ascension Group, stated on X that XRP may be progressing toward use as a global settlement bridge. He further suggested that, over time, XRP could potentially receive recognition from the BIS at the highest regulatory level. His remarks have encouraged renewed examination of what Tier-1 classification means and whether such a designation is realistically achievable for a crypto asset. XRP is looking more and more like it will claim it's spot as a global bridge asset and possibly be recognized by the BIS as tier-one asset in the future. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 6, 2026 The Tier-1 Assets Under BIS Standards Under the Basel framework developed by the BIS, Tier-1 assets represent the strongest and most reliable components of a bank’s capital structure. These assets are designed to absorb losses during periods of financial stress and form the foundation of a bank’s solvency position. Regulators require institutions to maintain strict minimum thresholds of Tier-1 capital to ensure systemic stability. Tier-1 capital is divided into two categories. The first, Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1), consists of common shares, retained earnings, and disclosed reserves. Banks are required to hold CET1 capital equal to at least 4.5% of their risk-weighted assets. The second category, Additional Tier-1 capital, includes instruments such as contingent convertible bonds that can absorb losses by converting to equity or being written down if a bank’s financial condition deteriorates. Assets traditionally associated with Tier-1 treatment include cash held at central banks, high-quality sovereign debt issued in domestic currency by highly rated governments, and fully allocated physical gold held directly by financial institutions. How Cryptocurrencies Are Currently Classified At present, cryptocurrencies do not fall within the Tier-1 category under BIS regulations. Instead, the BIS has introduced a separate framework that governs how banks may interact with digital assets. This framework divides crypto assets into two broad groups based on their risk characteristics. Group 1 includes tokenized versions of traditional assets and certain stablecoins that meet stringent backing, redemption, and governance requirements. When these conditions are satisfied, banks may treat such instruments similarly to the assets they represent. Algorithmic stablecoins, however, are excluded from this group. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Group 2 encompasses unbacked cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. These assets face the most restrictive capital requirements. Banks are generally limited to holding small exposures to Group 2 assets, often capped at 1% to 2% of their Tier-1 capital, reflecting regulatory concerns about volatility and risk. Hypothetical Impact of Tier-1 Recognition on XRP Despite these limitations, some XRP supporters continue to explore scenarios in which regulatory treatment could evolve. Claver’s comments contributed to renewed discussion about the potential consequences if XRP were ever removed from the Group 2 category and granted Tier-1 recognition. To assess this possibility, an analysis was conducted using Google Gemini AI. According to Gemini, a reclassification of XRP to Tier-1 status would fundamentally alter how banks could engage with the asset. Financial institutions would no longer face punitive capital charges and could potentially treat XRP like reserve assets. Under a purely hypothetical scenario in which such regulatory changes occurred by 2026, Gemini estimated that XRP’s price could range between $15 and $22, driven by increased institutional demand and broader integration into financial infrastructure. It’s essential to highlight that BIS regulations do not allow unbacked cryptocurrencies to be categorized as Tier-1 assets. The Basel framework reserves this classification for traditional capital components, sovereign exposures, and physical gold. Digital assets operate under a distinct regulatory structure specifically designed to reflect their higher risk profile. Any upgrade in XRP’s regulatory standing would require a fundamental reassessment of how international regulators evaluate digital assets. Without clear evidence of long-term stability, systemic relevance, and consistent institutional use, existing capital rules are unlikely to change. As things stand, Tier-1 classification remains a speculative concept rather than a realistic regulatory milestone.

Scott has signaled a markup and a committee vote as early as next Thursday, reports note, putting pressure on negotiators who have been revising the bill for months.

Based on reports, the draft includes provisions on how the SEC and CFTC would share oversight and on consumer protections, though most final details are still being hashed out. Lawmakers Face Key Policy Disputes Several major sticking points remain unresolved, including rules for decentralized finance, stablecoin yields, and how many regulators are needed to take enforcement actions. Reports have warned that the committee may be rushing toward a vote while those issues are still open, which could complicate getting bipartisan support later on. Industry groups and some senators have urged more time to iron out those details. That pressure comes as proponents argue the country needs clearer rules to guide firms and investors. The debate has become both technical and political, with members of both parties expressing concern about leaving important protections unclear. Markets React To The Uncertainty Based on market reports, news of delays and uncertainty around the bill has already moved prices. Bitcoin briefly pushed past $93,000 before retreating to about $86,729 after a recent holdover in the Senate, showing how sensitive crypto markets can be to legislative timing. Traders and firms are watching the calendar closely because even the promise of a vote can sway flows and sentiment.

The risk reset came through energy first. Oil prices fell sharply after President Donald Trump confirmed Venezuela would supply up to 50M barrels of crude under a new arrangement following the weekend upheaval, a headline that markets read as a potential pressure valve on global prices over time. Asian shares took a step back as that narrative sank in. Japan’s Nikkei slid 1.1% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.3%, while Australia’s ASX 200 edged 0.2% higher, helped by commodity exposure. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $90,975 down 2.1% Ether : $3,160, down 3.4% XRP : $2.17, down 4.5% Total crypto market cap: $3.20 trillion, down 1.9% Wall Street Stumbles As Softer Jobs Data Tests Risk Appetite US markets handed over a shakier lead. On Wednesday, Wall Street turned mixed as investors digested softer labour signals ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report, with traders also tracking the Venezuela fallout and other Trump-driven policy headlines. Bonds held onto their bid, and the dollar eased slightly, as investors weighed whether cooling jobs indicators keep the Federal Reserve on track for rate cuts later this year. ETF Demand Anchors Crypto As Traders Look Past Venezuela Crypto traders kept their focus on flows and positioning, not just the Venezuela tape. Bitfinex analysts wrote on X, “Flows and access are still moving in Bitcoin’s favour. US spot ETFs added more than $1.1B of net inflows in the first two trading days [of the year], Morgan Stanley filed for a BTC trust, MSCI kept crypto-treasury names in its indexes, helping preserve passive exposure,” they said. They added, “In the background, the S&P 500 is at new highs. Metals sit near records, and US gasoline prices are at multi-year lows, easing headline inflation pressure. For traders, 2026 opens with higher volume but a macro backdrop that still leans supportive for risk.” Geopolitics stayed busy beyond Caracas. China escalated pressure on Japan by banning exports of dual-use items for military use, adding another layer to an already tense relationship between Asia’s two biggest economies. The calendar now does the heavy lifting. Investors line up Friday’s jobs report and a US Supreme Court ruling tied to Trump’s global tariffs, with both events carrying the kind of headline risk that can whip around rates, equities, and crypto in the same session.

Chen’s network is accused of orchestrating an estimated $12 billion‑plus crypto fraud, using so‑called “pig butchering ” scams and forced‑labour cyber‑fraud compounds to defraud victims worldwide. Cambodia’s Interior Ministry confirmed that Chen — a Chinese‑born tycoon and former Cambodian citizen whose citizenship was revoked in December 2025 — was arrested along with two alleged co‑conspirators after a months‑long investigation and deported to the People’s Republic of China at Beijing’s request. Following his actions, Chen faced severe charges for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in October. Notably, while imposing these charges, the court cited the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group’s participation in operating scam sites that defrauded individuals from the US and globally. After these charges were filed, the US authorities alleged that Chen’s illegal actions transformed Prince Group into one of the most significant transnational criminal organizations in Asia. The crypto industry faces another significant fraud case Several victims of the $12 billion crypto fraud claimed that they were under forced compliance at these scam sites. They further disclosed that Chen’s firm pressured them to engage in crypto-related fraud schemes, widely known as “pig butchering” scams. Sources noted that crypto scammers in such incidents begin by establishing fake relationships with users who are unaware of any danger or threat before initiating their motive of stealing their funds. Ideally, the expression “pig butchering” is derived from the concept of making a pig gain muscle and a healthy amount of weight efficiently before it is killed. Meanwhile, reports confirmed that Chen’s team collected a total of 127,271 Bitcoin, worth approximately $11.6 billion, according to the current market price. After a lengthy investigation, the US government confiscated these assets, marking the biggest seizure in history. To serve as a warning to individuals with similar intentions to Chen, the Department of Justice imposed sanctions on the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group and others involved in this illegal activity. Several individuals spark safety concerns in the ecosystem Technology has played a significant role in facilitating criminal activities within the crypto industry. To support this claim, sources revealed that Chen’s team illegally transported hundreds of its staff members to various locations in Cambodia to run their fraud scheme. The Prince Group’s chairman utilized technology to gain direct control over these locations and managed to store detailed records of each one. At this time, his partners utilized cryptocurrencies to conceal the team’s earnings. Chen and his colleagues used some of the collected funds to purchase luxurious items, such as a painting by Pablo Picasso, and catered to their trip to lavish places. Following the seizure of $12 billion in Bitcoin as a result of the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group’s unlawful act, reports from Chainalysis indicate that more than $75 billion has been collected from crypto-related criminal activities. This announcement sparked safety concerns among individuals. To demonstrate the intense nature of the situation, sources pointed out that criminal groups gathered almost $15 billion in their own accounts as of July. This figure represents an over 300% surge since 2020, with most of this income resulting from funds stolen, according to a report from a reliable source. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Near The Neutral Zone The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the sentiment that’s held by the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. It determines the investor mentality using the data of these five factors: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Improve, But Signal Still Not Decisive: Glassnode The index uses a numerical scale running from zero to hundred for representing the sentiment. On this scale, all values below 47 correspond to a net sentiment of fear, while those above 53 to one of greed. Levels lying between the two thresholds represent a neutral mentality. Now, here is how the current Bitcoin sentiment is like, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of 42 right now, suggesting a fearful sentiment is shared by the majority. However, the indicator’s value is quite close to the neutral region, so the dominance of fear isn’t too significant. Just a few days ago, this wasn’t the case, as the index was deep into the fear territory. In fact, the metric’s value was so low that it was inside a special zone called the extreme fear. The turn from extreme fear to the nearly-neutral level of today has come as Bitcoin and other digital assets have enjoyed a recovery rally. Given the trend, it’s possible that if the bullish market push continues, trader sentiment could return to the neutral territory, or even edge slightly into the greed zone. Historically, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have tended to move in the direction that goes contrary to crowd expectations. The probability of an opposite move occurring may be considered the strongest inside the extreme areas of extreme fear (25 and under) and extreme greed (above 75), as they have been where major bottoms and tops have formed in the past. The bottom in November, which has acted as the low for Bitcoin so far, also formed when the market held a sentiment of extreme fear. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation: Data Shows Institutions Are Net Buyers Again Now that the Fear & Greed Index has edged to the neutral zone, though, sentiment may not be able to dictate where the market will head next, since traders currently don’t agree on a direction. In such an environment, the chances of a move occurring in either direction may be equally probable. BTC Price Bitcoin broke above $94,000 earlier in the week, but its price has seen a setback as it’s now back at $92,000.

56960832,654722,1767844848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56960832.jpeg,Solana ETF Volume Explodes: Anomaly Or New Normal?,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-etf-volume-explodes-anomaly-or-new-normal/,bitcoinist,"Solana spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have witnessed a $220 million spike in trading volume. Here’s what this could mean for the asset. Solana Spot ETF Volume Has Shot Up In a new insight post on its website, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed what spikes in the spot ETF trading volume mean for Bitcoin and Solana. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow traders to gain indirect exposure to an underlying asset. In the context of cryptocurrencies, they allow investors an off-chain route into digital assets that doesn’t require them to deal with exchanges and wallets; the fund buys and custodies the tokens on their behalf. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first Bitcoin spot ETFs back in January 2024. Ethereum funds got the green light in July of that year, while Solana obtained its approval in October 2025. Thus, while BTC and ETH spot ETFs have been around for some time now, SOL products are relatively new. As the chart shared by Santiment shows, SOL spot ETFs observed a burst of trading volume during the initial launch hype. Solana spot ETF volume rose to a high of $122 million on October 28th, but excitement was quick to run out as the metric fell to a much lower level soon after. This record wasn’t broken for the rest of the year, but six days into 2026, SOL ETFs finally saw activity surpassing that of the launch period. From the chart, it’s visible that SOL volume hit $220 million on January 6th, significantly higher than the October 28th spike. The uptick in the cryptocurrency’s investment vehicles has come as its price has enjoyed a rally, and Morgan Stanley has filed for its first Solana and Bitcoin ETFs. As for what the volume surge could mean for the asset, it’s hard to say from the data of SOL ETFs alone, as they are still quite young. Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, have been around for two years now, so some interpretations can be made from their data. As the analytics firm has highlighted in the chart, Bitcoin has seen two types of surges in the ETF volume: a healthy, sustained rise that supports price moves, and sudden spikes that mark local reversals. Solana’s latest spike could be of the latter type, but since its spot ETFs still have a small sample size, the pattern with them is yet uncertain. The sharp surge could be an anomaly, or it could just be the start of a new normal (which, if so, would put the spike in the former category). SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $138, up more than 9% over the last week.",Solana|bitcoin|Ethereum|SOL|solana|Solana ETF|Solana ETF Volume|SOLUSDT,BTC|ETH|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

BUCK token holders receive yield but lack ownership or redemption rights to STRC, as well as exposing them to both crypto and traditional finance risks. STRC could see modest demand from BUCK, but even a $100 million BUCK issuance would only absorb about 3% of STRC shares. I view BUCK as uncompetitive versus existing DeFi and euro-denominated yield options, so it is not a catalyst to buy STRC now. One of the major Bitcoin ( BTC-USD )-adjacent stories in 2025 was the arrival of perpetual preferred stocks from BTC guzzler (Micro)Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF )( STRC ). I covered Strategy's common stock and its preferred shares several times over the course of the year. My thinking can best be summed up in this way : the common stock should be avoided by investors, but the preferred stocks are interesting to various degrees. My preference among what are now four different US Dollar-based Strategy preferred stocks is STRF, and I still personally hold shares . I have yet to offer the market my thoughts on the Stretch Perpetual Preferred Stock class but will get into how the stock is being used in an interesting, albeit risky, ""tokenized"" product by a third party. ""The Bitcoin Dollar"" On January 6th, Cayman-based Buck Labs launched the self-described ""Bitcoin Dollar"" through the Buck Token (BUCK-USD) on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Unlike stablecoins, which generally don't see direct yields from T-bill collateral passed through to token holders, BUCK is being positioned as a ""SavingsCoin"" rather than as a stablecoin. 'SavingsCoin' (Buck.io) Instead of requiring interaction with saving/lending protocols to earn yield like stablecoins do, BUCK holders are entitled to 7% yields simply by allocating capital to the token. Buck Labs says the token would appeal to savers, institutions, and speculators when they are in between trades, though the white paper states that Buck's target market is retail investors in the EU. Unlike permissionless stablecoins, buying or selling the BUCK token isn't possible without AML compliance and also isn't available in the United States presently. Staking the asset isn't required to generate the yield, but holders do have to go through a claim process via the Buck App to receive their token rewards. The obvious question is how could Buck Labs possibly advertise 7% yields for a dollar-based product without staking when the collateral backing stablecoins is generating closer to 3.5%? The simple answer is BUCK is not backed by T-bills. Rather, buying BUCK is indirectly buying exposure to Bitcoin through a token where proceeds are ultimately used to buy STRC shares. Those shares currently have an effective yield of 11%. So despite paying a substantial yield to token holders, BUCK issuer Buck Labs is actually taking a larger spread than both Tether and Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) on the collateral purchased for the tokens. Interestingly, BUCK is being positioned primarily as a 'governance' token that enables holders to vote on DAO proposals. BUCK token holders don't have any claim on the STRC shares purchased by the issuer. Per the white paper, bold my emphasis: The Issuer, not token holders, will hold legal and beneficial title to its assets, including any treasury assets it acquires to fund ongoing business operations. The Buck Token is a fungible crypto-asset issued on Ethereum blockchain. The Token is not backed by assets or pegged to any currency. Its value is determined solely by market supply and demand. The Token does not grant holders any ownership, claim or other legal or economic rights over the Issuer or its assets, nor any entitlement to dividends, profits or other returns. Essentially, BUCK is not actually backed by STRC, and BUCK holders don't have any actual ownership rights or redemption mechanisms for the STRC shares that provide the BUCK yield. Will BUCK Drive STRC Purchases? The simple answer to the question above is, ""it's possible."" However, I suspect any potential bid on STRC from growing BUCK issuance will be relatively small in the grand scheme of things. Consider that STRC has a market capitalization of just under $3 billion. In the BUCK white paper, Buck Labs cites a goal of $100 million as an initial offer. So even if the entire $100 million offer of BUCK is reached, we're talking about 3% of outstanding STRC shares getting pulled into the BUCK ecosystem. That's certainly not nothing, as it's about four days of average volume for STRC shares. But I have serious doubts that BUCK will be able to come close to $100 million in supply. I hold that view because I don't think BUCK is a very good product despite the lofty yield. For starters, BUCK requires the AML compliance associated with traditional finance but also settles on public blockchain rails. One of the key risks from the white paper lays out how investors could actually lose access to their BUCK tokens: Risks such as private key loss, hacking incidents at custodians or exchanges, and unauthorized access can lead to permanent loss of tokens. Any real crypto-native already knows the private key risk associated with on-chain tokens. It's a notable trade-off that comes with decentralized systems. But what makes this so much more concerning with BUCK is that holders get the data breach risk of personal information held by centralized issuers without what would be the equivalent of 'lost password' protection. Following completion of the AML compliance, it could still take up to 3 days for BUCK buyers to receive their tokens. Which means BUCK offers the asset access safety of on-chain crypto with the speed and data theft risk of TradFi. This is not a compelling mix, from where I sit. On top of that, BUCK holders are only taking 7% from an asset that actually yields 11%. While recognizing that BUCK isn't available for the US market and the token could be more appealing to EU participants who may not have easy access to a direct STRC purchase, I still think giving up 4% might be a tough pill to swallow when there are stablecoin yield opportunities available through DeFi protocols that can yield between 7% and 10% through permissionless tokens like USDC ( USDC-USD ) or Tether ( USDT-USD ). Furthermore, institutional players in Europe can buy Strategy's euro-denominated product STRE, which had an effective yield of 12.5% when it launched back in November. Closing Summary The fact that STRC is being used as a way to sell tokenized dollar yields outside the US is certainly intriguing. If BUCK is actually successful and exhausts an initial offering of $100 million tokens, it could theoretically create a bid on STRC shares that generates capital appreciation in the stock. Which is definitely something that I think current STRC shareholders should be paying attention to. That said, I'm not of the view that Buck Labs will sell $100 million BUCK tokens. Furthermore, I'm not really sure BUCK is even a product that solves any problem. For EU market participants with a risk appetite who want higher dollar-denominated yields, I don't see how a new permissioned token that earns yields from presumptive Bitcoin gains is any more attractive than the permissionless tokens and DeFi protocols already available in the market. None of this means that investors in STRC should sell, but I don't think BUCK is a reason to buy today either.",BTC-USD|MSTR|USDC-USD|USDT-USD|STRC,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This significant capital movement marks a pivotal moment for the regulated cryptocurrency investment sector, drawing immediate analysis from market observers. The data reveals a broad-based withdrawal, not isolated to a single fund, prompting a deeper examination of underlying market dynamics and investor sentiment. Analyzing the Sharp Rise in Bitcoin ETF Outflows The reported net outflow of $486.91 million represents a stark increase from the $240 million recorded just one day prior. Consequently, this two-day trend signals a potential cooling period following the initial fervor surrounding spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. Market analysts consistently monitor these flows as a real-time barometer for institutional and retail investor appetite. Furthermore, the scale of the withdrawal necessitates a breakdown to understand which major financial players experienced the most significant redemptions. A detailed ledger of the January 7 outflows presents a clear picture. Leading the retreat was Fidelity’s FBTC, with outflows of $247.62 million. BlackRock’s IBIT followed, recording outflows of $130.79 million. Other notable funds included Ark Invest’s ARKB ($42.27M), Bitwise’s BITB ($39.03M), VanEck’s HODL ($11.57M), and Grayscale’s GBTC ($15.63M). This distribution indicates the activity was not driven by a single event affecting one provider but reflected a broader market reassessment. Contextualizing the Crypto Investment Fund Landscape To fully grasp the importance of these outflows, one must consider the historical context of Bitcoin exchange-traded products. For years, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) operated as a closed-end fund, often trading at a significant premium or discount to its net asset value. However, its conversion to a spot ETF in early 2024 unlocked a massive amount of pent-up shareholder liquidity. Initially, GBTC dominated outflow figures as investors rotated into newer, lower-fee competitors. The recent data, however, shows a new phase. Now, the newer spot Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are also seeing notable outflows. This shift suggests the movement may be less about fund-specific rotation and more about macro sentiment towards Bitcoin itself. Potential factors include profit-taking after a price rally, reactions to broader equity market volatility, or reassessments of interest rate expectations by the Federal Reserve. Expert Perspectives on Market Dynamics Financial analysts specializing in digital assets point to several converging factors. First, Bitcoin often experiences price consolidation after major rallies, and ETF flows can mirror this technical pattern. Second, traditional market indicators, such as bond yields or dollar strength, can indirectly influence cryptocurrency allocations. Third, the sheer novelty of these products means flow volatility is expected as the market finds its equilibrium. Historical data from other asset classes shows that new ETF products frequently experience high early volatility in creation and redemption activity. This process does not inherently signal a long-term bearish trend for the underlying asset. Instead, it often reflects the natural price discovery and portfolio rebalancing mechanisms of a maturing market. The true test will be the sustainability and direction of flows over the coming weeks and months. Impact and Implications for the Digital Asset Ecosystem The immediate impact of substantial ETF outflows is direct selling pressure on the underlying Bitcoin market. Authorized Participants (APs) redeem ETF shares by returning them to the fund sponsor. In turn, the sponsor sells the corresponding Bitcoin holdings to return cash to the AP. This process creates a direct, measurable link between fund flows and spot market activity, a transparency previously absent from crypto markets. For long-term market health, however, this mechanism is vital. It demonstrates the ETFs are functioning as designed, providing efficient liquidity and price arbitrage. Moreover, these flows provide unparalleled, transparent data for all market participants. Regulators, investors, and analysts now have a clear, auditable trail of institutional capital movement in and out of Bitcoin, which may ultimately reduce volatility and increase mainstream adoption confidence. Conclusion The notable $486.9 million in Bitcoin ETF outflows on January 7 underscores the dynamic and responsive nature of the newly established spot Bitcoin ETF market. While the figure is significant, it represents a normal function of liquid, regulated financial products. Analysts will watch subsequent flow data closely to determine if this marks a short-term correction or the beginning of a new trend. Ultimately, the transparency provided by these daily flow reports strengthens the entire digital asset investment landscape, offering clear signals in a historically opaque market. FAQs Q1: What does “ETF outflow” mean in this context? An ETF outflow occurs when the value of shares redeemed from the fund exceeds the value of shares created. This requires the fund to sell some of its underlying assets, in this case Bitcoin, to return cash to investors. Q2: Why are outflows from BlackRock and Fidelity significant? Outflows from these newer funds, beyond just Grayscale, suggest the selling pressure is broader and may be linked to general Bitcoin market sentiment rather than just rotation from an older product into newer ones. Q3: Do ETF outflows always cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? Not always, but they can create selling pressure. The overall price is determined by global spot market supply and demand across all exchanges. Large ETF outflows are one significant factor among many. Q4: How does this data compare to historical ETF flow patterns? High volatility in flows is common for new ETF products. The market is still in an early price discovery phase, and such activity is typical as investors test liquidity and establish positioning strategies. Q5: Where can investors find this flow data? Several financial data firms and cryptocurrency analytics platforms publish daily aggregated and fund-specific flow data for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, often with a one-day lag.

Its price has soared 21% over the past week, sparking hopes among bulls that a new all-time high can be reached in 2026. We delved deeper and asked four of the most widely used AI-powered chatbots whether such a rally is possible. ‘Extraordinary Catalysts’ Would be Required As of this moment, DOGE trades just below $0.15, meaning it needs a 430% rally to surpass its historical record of approximately $0.74 set in the spring of 2021. According to ChatGPT, such a pump in the next 12 months is possible yet far from certain. It noted that Dogecoin remains the most recognizable meme coin, with deep liquidity across major exchanges, making it a natural target when hype picks up. The chatbot also added that the token is heavily influenced by the broader crypto market, suggesting its performance is often impacted by Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other leaders. “If BTC and ETH reach new highs and retail enthusiasm returns, DOGE often outperforms due to its speculative nature.” In conclusion, ChatGPT set the odds of a new ATH for the meme coin sometime this year at 35% – 45%. Grok, the chatbot integrated within X, estimated that a fresh DOGE record in 2026 is unlikely without “extraordinary catalysts.” It described the influence of Elon Musk (known as a Dogecoin supporter) and meme coin dynamics as the main factors. In case there isn’t a massive market-wide mania, DOGE’s most probable peak this year would be around $0.50, Grok added. Seems Like a ‘Miracle’ Scenario Perplexity backed Grok’s theory and claimed that supportive comments from Musk could positively impact DOGE’s valuation. However, it predicted that the meme coin can reach a maximum price of $0.44 this year, whereas a new all-time high is more likely to be celebrated in 2027. Google’s Gemini appears even more pessimistic, describing the potential explosion to a fresh record in 2026 as “a miracle scenario.” Instead, it claimed the ongoing year will offer a rebound and consolidation rather than a breaking surge above $0.74. “2026 is expected to be a strong year for DOGE, but reaching a new ATH is a low-probability event,” it concluded.

56962534,655060,1767848409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56962534.jpeg,Strategy Soars After MSCI Confirms Inclusion Of Bitcoin Treasury Firms In Its Index,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-soars-msci-confirms-bitcoin-treasury-firms/,bitcoinist,"On Wednesday, shares of Strategy (MSTR) climbed by 6% after Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) announced that it would maintain the inclusion of digital asset treasury companies (DATCOs) in its indexes. Strategy Maintains Index Designation Speculation surrounding a potential exclusion of Strategy—the leading player in the Bitcoin treasury space led by CEO Michael Saylor—had fueled uncertainty in the market. This concern contributed to a considerable decline in cryptocurrency prices including Bitcoin on October 10, as investors grappled with the implications of losing a key index designation. In its announcement issued on January 6, MSCI confirmed that it would not move forward with the proposal to exclude DATCOs from the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes as part of its upcoming February 2026 Index Review. Consequently, companies meeting the criterion of holding 50% or more of their assets in digital currencies will remain categorized as they are. However, MSCI did implement a crucial change in its guidelines, prompting significant implications for treasury-focused companies like Strategy. Capital-Raising Challenges Ahead Analysts at Bull Theory noted that previously, when Strategy would issue new shares to raise capital, MSCI would include these shares in their index, thus creating an automatic demand from index funds—typically requiring them to acquire 10% of the new shares. This forced buying could substantially benefit MicroStrategy. For example, if the shares were priced at $300 each and the company issued 20 million new shares, index funds would be compelled to purchase approximately $600 million worth of shares, enhancing Strategy’s ability to raise capital and, subsequently, its Bitcoin holdings. Under the new MSCI rule , however, while Strategy can still issue shares, MSCI will not increase the share count in its index. As a result, index funds are not obliged to buy any new shares, eliminating this previous demand. This shift requires Strategy to seek private buyers for its new shares, which may lead to lower capital raised and an inability to purchase as much Bitcoin as before. Morgan Stanley’s ETF Plans Market expert Crypto Rover emphasized the underlying question: why did MSCI make this change? Given MSCI’s origins with Morgan Stanley, the connection to the banking institution is significant. Bitcoinist reported on Tuesday that Morgan Stanley filed for a spot Bitcoin and Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), positioning MSTR as a direct competitor in the crypto investment space. Rover highlights that many investors opt for Strategy as a means to gain passive exposure to Bitcoin, which has contributed to a steady rise in MSTR stock and has established the company as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. With the new MSCI directive, Rover alleges that Strategy may face challenges in accumulating more Bitcoin. Any attempts to dilute shares could lead to significant declines in MSTR stock due to the lack of passive demand. The expert also asserts that this situation may prompt large investors to reallocate their funds from Strategy and similar treasury firms into Bitcoin ETFs, particularly given the likelihood that Morgan Stanley’s ETF will attract significant investment. At the time of writing, MSTR is trading at $166, having made a slight recovery from the 16-month low of $150 reached last Friday.

Per on-chain data, the largest asset manager snapped 3,948 BTC, nearly $371.89 million worth , on January 6. The fund flows confirm that BlackRock accumulated 31,737 ETH, worth $100.23 million, on the same day. Bullish Indicator For Traders? The influx of institutional capital is particularly noteworthy from a trading perspective. Such large combined Bitcoin and Ether accumulations often happen when institutions expect higher prices. Traders should monitor key support and resistance levels for BTC, which has shown resilience around $90,000 during similar accumulation phases. Besides, ETH purchases align with its ongoing network upgrades, suggesting breakouts above $3,200, where trading volume potentially spikes.

Analysts Draw Correlations,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/did-morgan-stanley-orchestrate-bitcoin-october-crash-analysts-draw-correlations/,newsbtc,"Morgan Stanley’s filing for a Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), coupled with MSCI’s decision to retain digital asset companies in its index, has ignited a wave of speculation among analysts. Notably, analysts from Bull Theory have alleged that these events could be indicative of a larger-scale market manipulation. Bitcoin Market Manipulation? In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Bull Theory analysts drew attention to the timeline of events involving Bitcoin, arguing that the trajectory from its October crash to its subsequent recovery in January resembles an orchestrated setup supported by data. The first significant trigger occurred on 10 October, when MSCI — previously a division of Morgan Stanley — proposed removing Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) from its global indexes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Strategy Purchases 1,287 BTC Amid Rising Prices This decision would affect firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, which hold substantial Bitcoin assets on their balance sheets. The implications were profound, given that MSCI’s indexes guide trillions of dollars in passive investments. If these companies were removed, institutional investors, including pension funds and ETFs, would be compelled to divest, leading to a substantial contraction in institutional exposure to Bitcoin and an immediate tightening of liquidity. Following that announcement, Bitcoin’s price plummeted by nearly $18,000, wiping out over $900 billion from the total crypto market cap. Morgan Stanley And The MSCI Shift The uncertainty continued with a consultation period that remained open until December 31. This three-month window of prolonged anxiety effectively froze investor demand for Bitcoin. Passive investors became wary, index-linked funds faced potential forced selling, and as a result, prices saw a stark decline—with Bitcoin dropping about 31% and altcoins suffering even more, marking the worst quarter for crypto markets since 2018. However, the tide began to shift on January 1, 2026, as Bitcoin experienced an unexpected surge, rising 8% in just five days. This $7,300 increase, from $87,500 to $94,800, left many analysts puzzled, especially since the relentless selling had seemingly halted abruptly. The analysts noted that this sudden upturn could imply that insiders might have had prior knowledge of forthcoming developments. Then, the narrative shifted dramatically on January 5 and 6. In a matter of 24 hours, Morgan Stanley unveiled its plans for spot Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana ETFs. This was followed by MSCI announcing its decision not to proceed with the previously proposed exclusion of crypto-heavy companies from its indexes. A Calculated Move? The sequence of these events has led the analysts to present a narrative: MSCI initiated pressure by threatening index removals in October, leading to an extended period of uncertainty and suppressed prices. Related Reading: Solana Shatters Records: 2025 Annual Review Reveals New All-Time Highs In Key Metrics Once institutions had accumulated at lower prices, Morgan Stanley introduced its ETF, and MSCI subsequently removed the threat of exclusion, raising serious concerns about the possibility of coordinated efforts to manipulate market conditions. Bull Theory analysts assert that as the market now transitions back towards liquidity, the same entities that potentially orchestrated the prior downturn may be strategically positioned to profit from the rebound. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $91,550, having retraced 2% from the $95,000 2-month high reached at the beginning of the week.

DOGE is now consolidating and might decline if it trades below $0.140. DOGE price started a fresh increase above $0.1480 and $0.1520. The price is trading below the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $0.150 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.140. Dogecoin Price Consolidates Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1420, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.1450 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.150. A high was formed at $0.1541 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1155 swing low to the $0.1541 high. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $0.150 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1480 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.150 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1540 level. A close above the $0.1540 resistance might send the price toward $0.1625. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.1680. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1720. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.150 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1450 level. The next major support is near the $0.140 level. The main support sits at $0.1360 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1155 swing low to the $0.1541 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.1360 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.130 level or even $0.1280 in the near term.

This analysis, based on verifiable blockchain metrics, provides objective insights into current market dynamics without speculative claims. Understanding the Bitcoin STH Profitability Signal On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant recently highlighted a notable trend in Bitcoin’s market structure. Contributor Maartunn identified that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) is rising toward the crucial baseline of one. This metric serves as a fundamental indicator of market psychology and profit-taking behavior among investors who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. The STH SOPR calculation measures whether coins moved on the blockchain are being sold at a profit or loss. When the ratio exceeds one, holders realize profits through their transactions. Conversely, values below one indicate loss realization. The current movement toward this equilibrium point suggests changing market conditions that warrant careful examination. Technical Analysis of the SOPR Metric The Spent Output Profit Ratio represents a sophisticated on-chain analytical tool that tracks the economic behavior of different investor cohorts. For short-term holders specifically, this metric provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price pressure points. Historical data shows consistent patterns around this indicator that market analysts monitor closely. Several factors contribute to the current STH SOPR movement. First, Bitcoin’s price recovery from recent lows has improved the cost basis for many recent buyers. Second, reduced selling pressure from this cohort indicates changing holder behavior. Third, the metric’s approach to the baseline suggests a potential shift from loss-taking to profit-taking psychology. Historical Context and Market Cycles Previous Bitcoin market cycles demonstrate the significance of STH SOPR movements. During the 2018-2019 bear market, sustained periods below the baseline preceded eventual recoveries. Similarly, the 2020-2021 bull market saw the metric remain consistently above one during upward trends. Current movements should therefore be analyzed within this broader historical framework. Market analysts typically examine several related indicators alongside STH SOPR. These include long-term holder behavior, exchange flows, and miner activity. The convergence of multiple metrics provides stronger signals than any single data point. Currently, other on-chain indicators show complementary patterns that support the STH SOPR analysis. Implications for Bitcoin Market Structure The potential crossing of the STH SOPR baseline carries several implications for Bitcoin’s market structure. First, it could indicate reduced selling pressure from recent buyers who might otherwise liquidate positions at a loss. Second, it suggests improving sentiment among market participants who entered during recent price ranges. Third, it may signal the beginning of a healthier market phase. Market participants should consider several important distinctions. The STH SOPR measures realized behavior rather than predicted outcomes. Additionally, the metric reflects past transactions, not future intentions. Finally, sustained movement above the baseline matters more than temporary crossings for establishing trend changes. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Markets Similar concepts exist in traditional financial markets, though blockchain data provides unprecedented transparency. Equity markets use various holder profitability metrics, but Bitcoin’s public ledger enables more precise measurement. This transparency represents a significant advancement in market analysis capabilities that benefits all participants through improved information efficiency. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Context The Bitcoin STH SOPR movement occurs within a specific regulatory and macroeconomic environment. Global cryptocurrency regulations continue evolving, with different jurisdictions implementing varied approaches. Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors including interest rates and inflation impact all risk assets, creating complex intermarket relationships that analysts must consider. Several verification methods exist for the reported data. Blockchain analytics firms use multiple data sources and calculation methodologies to ensure accuracy. Independent verification through alternative platforms provides additional confidence in the reported trends. This multi-source approach aligns with best practices in financial data analysis. Conclusion Bitcoin short-term holders approaching profitability represents a significant on-chain development that market participants should monitor carefully. The STH SOPR metric’s movement toward the critical baseline of one suggests changing market dynamics that historically correlate with momentum shifts. While no single indicator guarantees future price movements, this development provides valuable data points for informed market analysis within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the STH SOPR metric? The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio measures whether Bitcoin held for less than 155 days is being sold at a profit or loss, with values above one indicating profit realization and values below one showing loss-taking. Q2: Why does the baseline of one matter for this metric? The baseline of one represents the equilibrium point where holders break even on their transactions. Crossing this threshold signals a shift in market psychology from loss-taking to potential profit-taking behavior. Q3: How reliable is this indicator for predicting Bitcoin price movements? While historically correlated with market phases, STH SOPR should be considered alongside other indicators rather than as a standalone predictor. It reflects realized behavior rather than forecasting future prices. Q4: What time period defines “short-term holders” in this analysis? Most on-chain analytics platforms define short-term holders as addresses that have held Bitcoin for 155 days or less, based on statistical analysis of holder behavior patterns. Q5: How does this development relate to long-term Bitcoin holders? Long-term holders (those holding beyond 155 days) typically show different behavioral patterns. Their profitability metrics often remain positive through market cycles, providing contrasting data to short-term holder analysis.

Key Takeaways: CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju expects Bitcoin to trade sideways in early 2026 as capital flows slow. Weak sentiment and rotation into stocks and precious metals are weighing on short-term momentum. Strong ETF inflows suggest institutional interest remains despite the muted price outlook. “Capital inflows into Bitcoin have dried up,” Ju said Wednesday , arguing that money has recently shifted toward equities and precious metals as gold and silver prices surge. While Bitcoin has often shown strong momentum early in the year, Ju said the current setup points to a period of subdued price action rather than a sharp rally or sell-off. Bitcoin Slips From Weekly High as CryptoQuant CEO Sees Sideways Trading At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading around $90,900, down more than 2% on the day and off its weekly high near $94,400, according to CoinMarketCap. Ju said a deep drawdown appears unlikely, adding that the market is more likely headed for “boring sideways” trading over the coming months. A flat first quarter would run counter to historical patterns. January has typically delivered modest gains for Bitcoin, averaging a 3.8% return since 2013. February and March have been stronger, with average gains of 13.1% and 12.2%, respectively, according to data from CoinGlass. Ju’s cautious outlook follows recent warnings from veteran trader Peter Brandt and Fidelity macro research director Jurrien Timmer, both of whom have floated scenarios where Bitcoin could revisit the $60,000–$65,000 range this year. Capital inflows into Bitcoin have dried up. Liquidity channels are more diverse now, so timing inflows is pointless. Institutions holding long-term killed the old whale-retail sell cycle. MSTR won't dump any significant chunk of their 673k BTC. Money just rotated to stocks and… pic.twitter.com/Ha866TP857 — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) January 8, 2026 Market sentiment has also remained weak. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has hovered between “fear” and “extreme fear” since early November, registering a score of 28 on Thursday, signaling continued caution among traders. However, not all indicators are pointing lower. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened 2026 with renewed inflows, recording $925.3 million in net additions over the first three trading days of the year, according to Farside Investors. The flows suggest that institutional interest remains intact despite short-term hesitation. Bitcoin Bulls Stay Confident as Draper and Bitwise Eye New Highs in 2026 Optimism among long-term bulls also remains strong. Venture capitalist Tim Draper reiterated this week that 2026 would be a breakout year , repeating his long-standing $250,000 Bitcoin price target. Meanwhile, Bitwise head of research Ryan Rasmussen has argued that Bitcoin will break its traditional four-year cycle in 2026 and push to new highs. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions. Barhydt said the US central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy.

While bulls are making an effort to defend recent gains, the broader market context remains fragile, with several risk factors limiting upside conviction. Price action reflects a market caught between relief-driven buying and persistent sell-side pressure near major resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Regime: Market Supported By Seller Exhaustion, Not Buying Surge A recent CryptoQuant analysis highlights that Bitcoin is currently testing an important technical and on-chain confluence. On the daily timeframe, BTC has managed a strong rebound from the Point of Control (POC) around $85,000, an area that previously concentrated significant trading volume. This recovery pushed price back into the $92,000–$94,000 supply zone, where sellers have consistently stepped in. From a momentum perspective, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that bullish pressure is building, signaling improving short-term sentiment. However, on-chain data paints a more cautious picture. Key flow and positioning metrics indicate that the market may be approaching a zone where distribution risk increases, especially if buyers fail to absorb available supply. This divergence between improving technical momentum and warning signals from on-chain indicators places Bitcoin at a pivotal moment. Whether BTC can consolidate above $90,000 or faces renewed rejection will likely define the next directional move, making this level critical for traders and investors alike. Rising Sell-Side Risk at Key Resistance Levels The report explains that Bitcoin is currently trading just below a major technical resistance block, highlighted as a critical supply zone. Price has entered this area multiple times, but each attempt has lacked the conviction needed for a clean breakout. Historically, when Bitcoin fails to decisively clear such resistance, the market often responds with a liquidity sweep toward lower levels, targeting areas where unfilled demand remains. On-chain data reinforces this technical caution. An analysis of Binance’s exchange netflow over the past seven days reveals a sharp increase in assets moving onto the exchange. Bitcoin net inflows reached approximately $3.6 billion, while Ethereum saw an additional $1.15 billion. Combined, this represents roughly $4.75 billion in potential sell-side pressure entering centralized venues in a short period. Related Reading: XRP Shows “Coiled Spring” Setup As Network Liquidity Hits Record Levels This creates a clear divergence. While price action suggests an attempt to break higher, the rapid expansion of exchange reserves points to a different dynamic beneath the surface. Large holders and institutions may be positioning to sell into strength or establish short exposure near resistance, rather than supporting a sustained upside move. The timing is critical. The convergence of heavy inflows with Bitcoin testing the $92,000–$94,000 range skews risk to the downside in the short term. Unless buyers can absorb this supply and secure a strong daily close above $94,000, the probability of a pullback toward the $85,000 Point of Control remains elevated. Bitcoin Consolidates Below Key Weekly Resistance Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows price stabilizing after a volatile correction, with BTC currently trading around the $92,000 area. The recent rebound followed a sharp drawdown from the $120,000 region, where strong selling pressure emerged and broke the previous bullish structure. Since then, the price has entered a consolidation phase, attempting to build a base above former support turned resistance. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin is still trading below the weekly 50-period moving average, which now acts as a dynamic resistance around the mid-$90,000s. This level has capped upside attempts so far, indicating that bulls have not yet regained full control. At the same time, the weekly 100-period moving average continues to slope upward well below the current price, suggesting that the broader macro trend remains constructive despite the correction. Related Reading: Venezuela, Geopolitical Risk, And Bitcoin: What On-Chain Data Really Shows Price action over the last several weeks shows higher lows forming near the $85,000–$88,000 zone, signaling that buyers are stepping in on dips. Volume has decreased compared to the distribution phase near the highs, which is typical during consolidation periods and suggests selling pressure is easing rather than accelerating. However, the structure remains fragile. A failure to reclaim and hold above the $95,000–$98,000 range could keep Bitcoin trapped in a broader corrective range. Conversely, a decisive weekly close above the 50-week moving average would improve the technical outlook and increase the probability of a renewed push toward the $105,000–$110,000 area.

Morgan Stanley Files For Ethereum Trust On Tuesday, banking giant Morgan Stanley submitted an S-1 form with the US SEC for its Morgan Stanley Ethereum Trust, which seeks to generate returns for investors by tracking the price of ETH and to “reflect rewards from staking a portion of the Trust’s ether.” The SEC Filing shows that the bank “plans to engage one or more Staking Services Providers to conduct such Staking Activities,” using a staking model that “aims to maximize the portion of the Trust’s ether available for staking while controlling for liquidity and redemption risks. Nonetheless, the document doesn’t address key details, such as the exchange on which the fund will be listed, the Trust’s custodian, or the ticker. Morgan Stanley’s Ethereum ETF filing follows recent efforts to launch other investment products based on some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. As reported by Bitcoinst, the Wall Street giant announced that it had submitted preliminary filings for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) Trusts on Tuesday, seeking to hold and generate returns by tracking these two cryptocurrencies. In a January 6 statement, the bank detailed that “Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and Morgan Stanley Solana Trust are pending regulatory approval and would be passive investment vehicles that seek to track the performance of the price of the relevant cryptocurrency.” Similar to its submitted Ethereum ETF, the Solana fund will include an allocation for staking, and plans to engage one or more third-party staking service providers to conduct these activities. A Broader Crypto Push Notably, Morgan Stanley’s crypto ETF move is part of a broader shift toward a more welcoming approach that expands the presence of traditional institutions in the digital assets industry. This pivot follows US regulatory efforts led by the Trump administration to turn the country into the “crypto capital of the world.” Amid this major push, the SEC has published new generic listing standards for crypto-based ETFs, which have seen a successful run since their initial launch nearly two years ago. In 2024, Morgan Stanley, which had built one of the most significant Bitcoin ETF holdings in the US, allowed its managers to offer the products as an investment option for its wealthy customers. This enabled access to individuals with a minimum of $1.5 million in assets and an aggressive risk tolerance. In October 2025, it expanded its access to crypto fund investments for all clients, including those with retirement accounts, moving away from its previous customer restrictions. The shift allowed its financial advisors to present crypto funds to any client. It also announced last year that it would enable trading of the largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, through its E-Trade subsidiary.",Crypto News|bitcoin ETFs|btc|crypto adoption|crypto ETFs|Crypto institutional adoption|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum ETFs|ETHUSDT|Morgan Stanley crypto|SOL|Solana ETFs|US SEC|Wall Street Banks,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

These derivatives maintain their positions through funding rate mechanisms that balance long and short interests. The long/short ratio specifically measures the proportion of open positions betting on price increases versus those anticipating declines. Consequently, this metric provides valuable sentiment data that experienced traders analyze alongside traditional technical indicators. Furthermore, exchanges calculate these ratios using aggregated position data from all active traders on their platforms. Professional market participants consider several critical factors when interpreting long/short ratios. First, extreme readings often signal potential market reversals as crowded trades become unsustainable. Second, consistent trends across multiple exchanges typically indicate stronger conviction than isolated platform data. Third, funding rates accompanying these ratios provide additional context about market equilibrium. Finally, experienced analysts compare current ratios against historical averages to identify unusual positioning. The current 49.25% long to 50.75% short distribution represents one of the most balanced readings observed in recent months. Exchange-Specific Analysis of Bitcoin Derivatives Positioning Detailed examination of individual exchange data reveals subtle but important variations in trader behavior. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, reported a 49.35% long to 50.65% short distribution. This near-perfect equilibrium suggests professional traders on this platform maintain neutral expectations despite recent market volatility. Meanwhile, OKX displayed the most pronounced short bias with 48.63% long positions against 51.37% short positions. This 2.74 percentage point difference indicates slightly greater bearish sentiment among OKX’s predominantly institutional user base. Bybit’s data showed 49% long versus 51% short positioning, mirroring the overall market average almost exactly. The consistency across these three major platforms—which collectively represent approximately 85% of global cryptocurrency derivatives open interest—strengthens the statistical significance of today’s readings. Market structure analysts note that synchronized positioning across exchanges often precedes periods of reduced volatility as conflicting opinions balance each other. Additionally, the narrow range between exchange-specific ratios (less than 1 percentage point variation) suggests information efficiency in today’s interconnected cryptocurrency markets. Historical Context and Market Implications Comparing current ratios against historical data provides crucial perspective for proper interpretation. During Bitcoin’s November 2021 all-time high, aggregate long positions exceeded 65% across major exchanges. Conversely, the June 2022 market bottom saw short positions surge above 58%. Today’s nearly balanced 49.25%/50.75% distribution represents the most neutral sentiment reading since January 2024. This positioning typically correlates with consolidation phases where markets digest previous movements before establishing new trends. Several macroeconomic factors likely influence current derivatives positioning. First, ongoing regulatory developments in major economies create uncertainty about cryptocurrency market structure. Second, traditional financial market volatility affects risk appetite across all speculative assets. Third, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 creates conflicting narratives about supply dynamics. Fourth, institutional adoption continues progressing despite short-term price fluctuations. Finally, technical analysis shows Bitcoin testing key support levels that often trigger derivative repositioning. Mechanics of Perpetual Futures Funding Rates Perpetual futures maintain price parity with spot markets through sophisticated funding rate mechanisms. These periodic payments transfer value between long and short position holders based on market conditions. When long positions dominate, funding rates typically turn positive, requiring longs to pay shorts. Conversely, excessive short positioning usually creates negative funding rates where shorts compensate longs. Current funding rates across major exchanges remain near neutral levels, confirming the balanced sentiment indicated by long/short ratios. Experienced derivatives traders monitor several interconnected metrics simultaneously. First, they track open interest changes to distinguish between new positions and existing ones. Second, they analyze volume patterns to identify institutional versus retail activity. Third, they examine liquidation levels to understand potential price catalysts. Fourth, they monitor basis spreads between futures and spot prices. Fifth, they consider options market data for complete sentiment analysis. Today’s data shows moderate open interest growth accompanied by average trading volume, suggesting measured rather than frantic positioning adjustments. Institutional Versus Retail Trading Patterns Advanced data analytics reveal distinct behavioral patterns between institutional and retail derivatives traders. Institutional participants typically demonstrate more balanced positioning with smaller position sizes relative to capital. Retail traders often exhibit greater herd behavior with larger concentrated positions. Current exchange data suggests institutional traders maintain the slight short bias while retail traders show marginally more long exposure. This divergence creates interesting market dynamics where sophisticated and unsophisticated participants hold opposing near-term expectations. Several verification methods ensure data accuracy and reliability. First, exchanges calculate ratios using actual position data rather than surveys or estimates. Second, multiple data aggregators cross-verify figures across platforms. Third, blockchain analytics firms correlate on-chain movements with derivatives positioning. Fourth, regulatory filings from public cryptocurrency companies provide additional validation. Fifth, academic research consistently confirms the predictive value of properly interpreted long/short ratios. The consistency across these verification methods strengthens confidence in today’s reported figures. Global Market Correlations and External Influences Cryptocurrency derivatives markets increasingly correlate with traditional financial indicators despite maintaining unique characteristics. First, U.S. dollar strength inversely affects Bitcoin pricing across global exchanges. Second, equity market volatility spills over into cryptocurrency risk appetite. Third, interest rate expectations influence capital allocation decisions. Fourth, geopolitical developments affect all risk assets simultaneously. Fifth, technological advancements create fundamental value independent of market cycles. Current neutral derivatives positioning suggests traders await clearer signals from these external factors before establishing strong directional bets. Regional analysis reveals interesting geographical variations in trading behavior. Asian markets typically demonstrate greater derivatives activity during their daytime hours. European traders often focus on arbitrage opportunities between different instruments. North American participants increasingly influence markets through regulated products like Bitcoin ETFs. These regional patterns create continuous 24-hour trading flows that sometimes obscure underlying sentiment. However, aggregate long/short ratios effectively smooth these geographical variations to reveal genuine market psychology. Conclusion The current BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio of 49.25% long versus 50.75% short represents balanced market sentiment amid uncertain global conditions. This nearly equal distribution across Binance, OKX, and Bybit suggests traders await clearer directional signals before committing to strong bullish or bearish positions. While slight short bias exists, the minimal differential indicates cautious optimism rather than outright pessimism. Market participants should monitor upcoming economic data, regulatory developments, and technical levels that could trigger more decisive positioning. Ultimately, today’s BTC perpetual futures metrics reflect mature market behavior where participants carefully weigh multiple factors before establishing derivatives exposure. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio measure? The ratio measures the percentage of open long positions versus short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specific exchanges, providing insight into trader sentiment and market expectations. Q2: Why do different exchanges show slightly different long/short ratios? Variations occur because each exchange has distinct user demographics, trading interfaces, fee structures, and geographical concentrations that influence how traders position themselves in derivatives markets. Q3: How often should traders monitor these long/short ratios? Professional traders typically check these metrics daily for significant changes, but weekly trends often provide more reliable signals than daily fluctuations for longer-term positioning decisions. Q4: Can long/short ratios predict Bitcoin price movements accurately? While not perfect predictors, extreme ratios often signal potential reversals, and consistent trends across multiple exchanges frequently precede significant price movements when combined with other indicators. Q5: How do funding rates relate to long/short ratios? Funding rates balance perpetual futures markets by transferring payments between long and short positions; they typically become positive when longs dominate and negative when shorts prevail, working alongside ratios to maintain market equilibrium.

The surprise wasn’t merely that a major wirehouse wants in. It was the branding and the timing. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said he “didn’t see this coming,” amplifying Eric Balchunas’ “SHOCKER” reaction to the filings. Seyffart then pointed to Matt Hougan’s framing of what made it unusual: “Morgan Stanley manages 20 ETFs, but mostly under the Calvert/Parametric/Eaton Vance brands. These will be the 3rd and 4th ETFs to bear the ‘Morgan Stanley’ brand. Pretty remarkable.” Park, the head of alpha strategies at Bitwise and ProCap CIO, argues the late-cycle entry is precisely why the filing matters. “It is unheard of for a vanilla ETF product to launch two years after the first to market has already secured the liquidity throne,” he wrote. “IAU famously tried a year later, and never caught up.” Park’s point was that Morgan Stanley wouldn’t make that bet unless internal channels were flashing something the broader market still underestimates. Why This Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ For Bitcoin Park framed the filing as a total addressable market story, not a product story. “It means the market is MUCH bigger than even crypto professionals anticipated, especially to reach NEW customers,” he said. “This signals that despite IBIT being the fastest ETF in history to reach $80Bn in AUM (roughly 1/5th the time it took for second place VOO), there is enough untapped interest as viably researched and ascertained through MS’ proprietary wealth channels that they are willing to bet that a branded product has commercial viability.” He finished that thought with the kind of line that reads like a thesis statement for 2026: “It means we are still so early.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Wins As Trump Pumps GDP, Suppresses Oil: Arthur Hayes The “why now” also fits with Seyffart’s longer-running view that institutional platforms would eventually shift. “I’ve been saying for literal years that most of these firms will change their tune on crypto,” he wrote. “But it really was just a couple months ago that Morgan Stanley advisors were barred from buying crypto ETFs for their clients.” In other words: the timeline is compressing, and the posture is moving from cautious access to product ownership. Park’s second argument is that Morgan Stanley is treating Bitcoin as an identity product as much as an allocation sleeve. “It means that Bitcoin is ‘socially’ important just as much as it is ‘financially’ important as a product to offer to customers,” he wrote. “Consider the fact that for being ‘digital gold’ there are virtually no branded gold ETFs in existence, yet for Bitcoin there is.” In his view, that difference is the tell: a house-branded Bitcoin ETF isn’t only about exposure, it’s about what the firm signals to clients and recruits by having it at all. Park argued the branding functions as a credibility marker with a specific audience in mind. “This is because every asset manager knows that having a Bitcoin ETF communicates that they are forward thinking, young, and a little edgy that allows targeting the most challenging investor cohort that everyone wants to reach: UHNW Independent Investors,” he said.“ Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Improve, But Signal Still Not Decisive: Glassnode Morgan Stanley is making the bet that even if their ETF doesn’t scale to blockbuster success, there’s an intangible benefit that will help build their clout.” The third pillar is defensive: platform economics. “It is at the core a defensive move against platform disintermediation and fee leakage,” Park wrote. “By launching their own BTC ETF after IBIT already consolidated liquidity, Morgan Stanley is implicitly acknowledging a hard truth: DISTRIBUTION owns the customer, not product superiority.” He added why that matters strategically: “They are not going to let advisors default to third parties by outsourcing the economic rent. That’s why at first glance while this launch looks irrational through a pure AUM lens, also totally inevitable through a PLATFORM ECONOMICS lens.” That logic also surfaced in Seyffart’s exchange with James Van Straten, who asked why anyone would be surprised if a firm has “own distribution” and “huge demand from clients.” Seyffart’s answer didn’t dispute demand; it underscored that Morgan Stanley historically “doesn’t do a ton of ETF launches,” and that the decision to do so here is itself informative, even if, as he put it, “there’s plenty of demand” for many products that platforms never bother to manufacture. On timing, Seyffart said approval is “at least 75 days from now,” emphasizing that 75 days can be the fastest possible path under current processes, but also that “there’s plenty of products that don’t launch right at 75 days.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,256.

The commentary positions XRP within a wider discussion about rising national debt, persistent inflation, and shifting confidence in traditional monetary systems. Anderson positioned the current moment as one where market participants are increasingly attentive to alternatives that demonstrate both liquidity and functional efficiency. This Billionaire's #XRP Prediction Will SHOCK the Market? pic.twitter.com/eU0l2qGL3f — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) January 4, 2026 ETF Momentum Highlights XRP’s Institutional Traction Central to Anderson’s analysis is the performance of XRP-related exchange-traded products. He noted that XRP ETFs have accumulated approximately $1.16 billion in inflows since inception, with no recorded days of net outflows during that period. This consistency contrasts with recent volatility in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows, which experienced significant swings before closing the week near neutral. According to Anderson, XRP ETFs have already absorbed an estimated 746 million tokens, representing over one percent of the circulating supply, a figure he views as material when assessing market dynamics. Supply Constraints and the $5 Billion Scenario Looking ahead, Anderson outlined a scenario in which XRP ETF assets could reach $5 billion by mid-2026. Under that assumption, roughly 2.6 billion XRP could be removed from active circulation, equating to close to four percent of total supply. He emphasized that exchange balances for XRP reportedly declined sharply over the past year, suggesting reduced availability in spot markets. Anderson argued that sustained institutional holding through ETFs, combined with tightening supply conditions, could exert a measurable influence on price formation if demand remains steady or increases. Real-World Utility as a Valuation Anchor Beyond inflows, Anderson underscored the importance of demonstrated utility. He referenced comments from Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, who has stated that long-term value depends on real-world usage rather than capital flows alone. As an example, Anderson highlighted remarks from Arrington Capital founder, Michael Arrington, who described executing a $50 million XRP transfer in seconds at minimal cost, positioning XRP as an efficient settlement tool for large-scale transactions. This, Anderson suggested, provides tangible evidence of functionality that institutional investors often require.

He cited external forecasts, including a projection from Standard Chartered pointing to a potential triple-digit percentage increase, while cautioning that outcomes will depend on observable data such as ETF flows, supply trends, and overall market conditions. His analysis ultimately presented XRP as an asset increasingly influenced by institutional behavior rather than retail speculation, with 2026 shaping up as a critical period for validation.

56966432,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259616,1767856511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $90,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-90000-6/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $90,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Shift Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant correction on Tuesday as Bitcoin, the world’s leading digital asset, dropped below the psychologically important $90,000 threshold. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC currently trades at $89,957.24 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable decline from recent highs. This movement represents one of the most substantial single-day decreases observed in the 2025 trading year, consequently prompting renewed analysis of market fundamentals and investor sentiment. Bitcoin Price Movement: Current Market Context The descent below $90,000 follows several weeks of relative stability in cryptocurrency markets. Market analysts immediately began examining multiple potential catalysts for this movement. Trading volume across major exchanges increased by approximately 42% during the decline, indicating substantial selling pressure. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by $180 billion within the same 24-hour period, demonstrating Bitcoin’s continued influence on digital asset valuations globally. Historical data reveals that Bitcoin has tested the $90,000 support level three times previously in 2025. Each previous test resulted in either a rapid rebound or further decline toward $85,000. Market participants now closely monitor whether this level will hold as support or transform into resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 38, suggesting the asset approaches oversold territory but maintains room for additional downward movement. Technical Analysis Perspective Technical analysts highlight several concerning indicators emerging from recent price action. The 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming what traders call a “death cross” pattern. Additionally, trading volume patterns show increased activity during downward movements compared to upward trends. These technical factors combine with macroeconomic conditions to create a complex trading environment for both institutional and retail investors. Cryptocurrency Market Correlations and Impacts Bitcoin’s decline triggered corresponding movements across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Major altcoins including Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano experienced declines ranging from 8% to 15% within the same timeframe. This correlation demonstrates Bitcoin’s continued role as market leader and sentiment indicator. The table below illustrates the top five cryptocurrency performances during this market movement: Cryptocurrency Price Change Trading Volume Change Bitcoin (BTC) -4.8% +42% Ethereum (ETH) -7.2% +38% Solana (SOL) -9.1% +55% Cardano (ADA) -11.3% +47% Polkadot (DOT) -8.7% +41% Market analysts identify several interconnected factors contributing to this broad-based decline: Macroeconomic pressures including interest rate uncertainty Regulatory developments in major markets Institutional profit-taking after extended gains Technical selling triggers at key resistance levels Market sentiment shifts following extended bullish periods Historical Bitcoin Volatility Patterns Bitcoin’s current price action aligns with historical volatility patterns observed throughout its market history. The digital asset has experienced 15 similar percentage declines since surpassing $50,000 in early 2024. Each previous correction averaged 22 trading days from peak to trough, followed by recovery periods averaging 45 trading days. This historical context provides perspective for investors navigating current market conditions. Notably, Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased significantly compared to earlier market cycles. The 30-day volatility index currently measures 3.8%, substantially lower than the 8.2% average observed during 2021’s bull market. This reduced volatility reflects increasing institutional participation and market maturation. However, periodic corrections remain characteristic of cryptocurrency markets, serving as healthy consolidations within broader trends. Institutional Investment Flows Institutional investment vehicles including Bitcoin ETFs recorded mixed flows during the recent price movement. While some funds experienced modest outflows totaling $240 million, others maintained stable holdings. This divergence suggests institutional investors maintain varied perspectives on current market conditions. Several major financial institutions published research notes emphasizing long-term fundamentals remain unchanged despite short-term price volatility. Regulatory Environment and Market Development The current regulatory landscape significantly influences cryptocurrency market dynamics. Recent developments in multiple jurisdictions have created both challenges and opportunities for market participants. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework continues implementation, while United States regulatory clarity remains incomplete. These evolving frameworks create uncertainty that occasionally manifests in price volatility. Simultaneously, technological developments continue advancing blockchain infrastructure. The Bitcoin network recently processed its one billionth transaction, demonstrating growing adoption and utility. Layer-two solutions including the Lightning Network now facilitate over $100 million in daily transactions. These fundamental improvements contrast with short-term price movements, highlighting the complex relationship between technological progress and market valuation. Global Economic Factors Influencing Crypto Markets Traditional financial markets and macroeconomic conditions increasingly correlate with cryptocurrency valuations. The current interest rate environment, inflation expectations, and currency fluctuations all impact digital asset prices. Recent strength in the U.S. dollar index created headwinds for dollar-denominated assets including Bitcoin. Additionally, equity market performance influences risk appetite across all speculative asset classes. Geopolitical developments also affect cryptocurrency markets as investors seek alternative stores of value during uncertainty. Regions experiencing currency instability or capital controls demonstrate increased cryptocurrency adoption rates. These fundamental use cases provide underlying support for blockchain networks regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Market analysts monitor these adoption metrics alongside price charts for comprehensive market assessment. Mining Economics and Network Security Bitcoin’s price directly impacts mining economics and network security. The recent decline reduces mining profitability for operations with higher electricity costs. However, the network hash rate remains near all-time highs, indicating robust security despite price volatility. This resilience demonstrates the Bitcoin network’s fundamental strength independent of temporary market conditions. Mining difficulty adjustments scheduled for next week will further optimize network operations. Investor Psychology and Market Sentiment Market sentiment indicators provide valuable insight into current conditions. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index declined from 72 (Greed) to 48 (Neutral) following the price movement. Social media analysis reveals increased discussion of buying opportunities at current levels. Derivatives markets show balanced positioning with put/call ratios indicating neither extreme fear nor excessive optimism. Historical patterns suggest sentiment extremes often precede market reversals. The current neutral reading indicates neither panic selling nor irrational exuberance dominates investor psychology. This balanced sentiment typically supports healthy market development following corrections. Experienced investors monitor these psychological indicators alongside technical and fundamental factors for comprehensive market analysis. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $90,000 represents a significant market movement within the broader context of cryptocurrency evolution. While short-term volatility captures attention, long-term fundamentals including adoption rates, technological development, and institutional integration continue advancing. The Bitcoin price movement triggers necessary analysis of market structure, investor behavior, and external influences. Market participants now observe whether current levels establish support or precede further testing of lower thresholds. Regardless of immediate price action, blockchain technology’s transformative potential remains undiminished by temporary market fluctuations. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $90,000? Multiple factors contributed including macroeconomic uncertainty, technical selling at resistance levels, institutional profit-taking, and broader market sentiment shifts. No single catalyst explains complex market movements. Q2: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? This 4.8% decline represents a moderate correction within historical context. Bitcoin has experienced 15 similar declines since early 2024, averaging 22 trading days from peak to trough before recovery. Q3: Should investors be concerned about this price movement? Periodic corrections characterize all financial markets including cryptocurrencies. Long-term investors typically focus on fundamental developments rather than short-term volatility when making investment decisions. Q4: What support levels exist below $90,000? Technical analysts identify potential support near $85,000, $82,500, and $80,000 based on previous price action and trading volume patterns. Each level represents historical areas of increased buying interest. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin’s decline triggered corresponding movements across major altcoins, with decreases ranging from 8% to 15%. This correlation demonstrates Bitcoin’s continued role as market leader and sentiment indicator for the broader digital asset ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF is a strategic move that delivers reputational and long-term benefits beyond inflows. The bank’s ETF filing signals a deeper push into crypto through ETRADE and institutional adoption channels. Analysts say the move could add legitimacy to crypto ETFs and encourage other major banks to follow. “Morgan Stanley is making the bet that even if their ETF doesn’t scale to blockbuster success, there’s an intangible benefit that will help build their clout,” Park said Wednesday , framing the move as one designed to deliver broader gains across the firm. Morgan Stanley Files for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs in Crypto Push The comments followed a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two new products, including a spot Bitcoin ETF and a separate fund tied to Solana. The filing positions Morgan Stanley among a growing list of major financial institutions seeking a more direct role in crypto markets. Park said the value of the launch should be measured beyond headline inflows. He pointed to social and reputational gains, along with longer-term financial upside tied to the bank’s brokerage arm, ETRADE. Morgan Stanley, he noted, has been increasingly focused on monetizing ETRADE through crypto trading access and tokenization partnerships. “This becomes especially relevant as a positive externality if it helps recruit top talent versus competitors,” Park said, adding that the announcement underscores how large the crypto market has become, particularly as a channel for reaching new customers. Park also argued that simply offering a spot Bitcoin ETF sends a powerful signal. “Every asset manager knows that having a Bitcoin ETF communicates that they are forward thinking, young, and a little edgy,” he said, suggesting that perception alone can confer an advantage. heres what most people are missing about why Morgan Stanley launching Bitcoin ETF is the most bullish thing ever- 1) it means the market is MUCH bigger than even crypto professionals anticipated, especially to reach NEW customers. It is unheard of for a vanilla ETF product to… — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) January 7, 2026 Others see the move as potentially catalytic. Morningstar ETF analyst Bryan Armour told Reuters that Morgan Stanley may be looking to migrate existing Bitcoin exposure held by clients into its own ETFs, giving the products a quicker start despite the firm’s late entry. “A bank entering the crypto ETF market adds legitimacy to it, and others could follow,” Armour said. Morgan Stanley is widely regarded as one of the world’s top three investment banks, alongside Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. While both rivals maintain crypto-related initiatives, neither currently offers a proprietary crypto ETF, leaving Morgan Stanley with a chance to shape the next phase of institutional adoption. Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Sharp Outflows After Brief Early-2026 Inflow Burst US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sharp reversal in flows on Wednesday, posting $486.08 million in net outflows, according to the latest aggregated data. The pullback followed a short stretch of strong inflows earlier in the year and marked one of the largest single-day redemptions so far in 2026. The outflows came after two solid sessions to start the year. On Jan. 5, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $697.25 million, followed by $471.14 million on Jan. 2, briefly lifting cumulative net inflows above $57.7 billion. That momentum faded quickly, with redemptions accelerating on Jan. 6, when funds saw an additional $243.24 million leave. Looking back to late December, flows were mixed but leaned negative. Dec. 31 recorded $348.10 million in outflows, while Dec. 30 saw $355.02 million in inflows. Several other late-December sessions also showed consistent withdrawals, reflecting cautious positioning heading into the new year.

Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $93,500 Reclaim Holds The Key For Next Move XRP Becomes The Hottest Trade Of The Year CNBC’s Brian Sullivan highlighted XRP’s strong start to the year, calling the cryptocurrency the “new cryptocurrency darling” of 2026 and placing it ahead of the market’s leading assets. During the Power Lunch segment, the network’s anchor affirmed that “the hottest crypto trade of the year is not Bitcoin, it is not Ether, it is XRP,” arguing that there’s “big money behind this trade.” In his initial remarks, he pointed out the altcoin’s remarkable seven-day rally toward the recent highs. XRP has seen a notable performance since the start of the year, climbing over 30% from its yearly opening to its two-month high of $2.41 on Tuesday morning. Amid this recent performance, the altcoin recently flipped BNB again to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a place it had lost during the December market volatility. Moreover, it has outperformed most of the largest cryptocurrencies in the weekly timeframe, including BTC’s and ETH’s 4.3% and 6.2% respective rallies. CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos weighed in on XRP’s performance on various segments, affirming that “XRP has been the quiet outperformer for months now.” She addressed whether XRP is taking its place as “the next cool thing to know about” or whether it has a different and more relevant use case that sets it apart from the leading cryptocurrencies, emphasizing its role in cross-border payments as one of its key appeals. What’s Driving The Rally? Sigalos cited three main reasons for the strong star-of-the-year performance. First, she stated that “the regulatory overhang has finally cleared as Ripple has fully wrapped up its SEC fight as of August 2nd.” Second, she asserted that people consider the cryptocurrency “a less crowded trade than Bitcoin or Ether,” which “proved out to be true” just in the first trading days of January. For the third reason, she pointed out that “the flows have held up even during the Q4 dip,” arguing that investors continued to add to XRP-based funds, while the largest crypto ETFs’ flows fell with the price. Well, it’s actually been interesting is that during the doldrums of Q4, you actually saw a lot of people piling into those XRP ETFs, which is the exact opposite of what happens with the spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, where people really move in tandem with the price of the coin. But it was the fact that it is a way to have a higher percentage jump.

The ETF category has not recorded a single day of negative net flows in nearly two months, with consistent inflows since going live. During the first three trading days of the year, XRP funds have seen a total inflow of $78.81 million. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.19, a 20% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Analyst Kamran Asghar warns that a stronger rebound is essential to sustain momentum toward the $100,000 milestone. Notably, Bitcoin’s dip to $90,126, per CoinCodex data , reflects cautious market sentiment. Analyst Kamran Asghar warns that without a surge in on-chain activity, transaction volume, active addresses, and network usage, recent gains may struggle to sustain a push toward $100K. Well, Bitcoin’s past rallies to $60K and $70K were fueled by strong on-chain activity, including surging transactions and record active addresses. Today, muted engagement signals cautious investors, likely consolidating profits or awaiting clearer market cues before committing further capital. The analyst notes that while macroeconomic trends, interest rates, and regulations can sway investor behavior, lasting rallies hinge on genuine on-chain activity. Past cycles show that price surges without strong network support often trigger corrections. For Bitcoin to realistically reach $100,000, on-chain metrics must show a decisive rebound. Stronger network activity, higher transaction volumes, and increased engagement from long-term holders would signal renewed confidence and support a sustainable uptrend. While recent price gains are encouraging, Asghar emphasizes that true momentum depends on these underlying metrics. Until on-chain demand picks up, the path to $100K remains tentative, shaped by both market sentiment and network fundamentals. Investors should remember: genuine rallies are driven by activity, not just price spikes. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent rebound is encouraging, but without a surge in on-chain activity, the path to $100,000 may lack staying power. Asghar notes that lasting rallies rely on genuine network engagement, higher transaction volumes and active holder participation. Investors should monitor these on-chain metrics closely, as they will reveal whether the current momentum signals a historic surge or a short-lived spike.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Inside the Top 5 Shadow Holders,https://coinpaper.com/13609/who-really-controls-bitcoin-s-hidden-supply-inside-the-top-5-shadow-holders,coinpaper,"Bitcoin trades at $ 91,405 at the time of writing , holding steady as analysts revisit the role of hidden Bitcoin holdings tied to sanctioned states and entities. These so-called “shadow” reserves do not appear in official disclosures and often rely on opaque methods such as illicit transfers, covert mining, or off-chain settlements. Who controls the largest hidden pools of Bitcoin, and how do analysts track them? 1. Venezuela and the Alleged $60 Billion Bitcoin Reserve Venezuela stands at the center of current speculation. Intelligence-style reports claim the country accumulated between 600,000 and 660,000 Bitcoin since 2018 , placing its value between $60 billion and $67 billion at current prices. Reports link the buildup to gold exports, oil sales settled in USDT, and seized domestic mining operations. According to these accounts, Venezuela converted gold sales between 2018 and 2020 into Bitcoin at an average price near $5,000. Later, the state oil company PDVSA reportedly accepted USDT for crude exports from 2023 to 2025, then converted the stablecoins into BTC to reduce exposure to sanctions. Analysts stress that no on-chain evidence confirms these figures, yet the scale alone keeps Venezuela at the top of shadow reserve discussions. 2. North Korea’s Cyber-Fueled Bitcoin Accumulation North Korea does not rely on mining or purchases to build Bitcoin exposure. Instead, the regime depends heavily on cybercrime . United Nations estimates show North Korea-linked hackers stole more than $630 million in crypto during 2022 and $1.34 billion during 2024. In early 2025, the Lazarus Group drained $1.4 billion in Ethereum from the Bybit exchange. These thefts often include Bitcoin and later conversions into BTC through decentralized platforms. Analysts link these funds to weapons development and foreign currency needs. Laundering tactics include wallet hopping, mixers, and decentralized exchanges, which complicate attribution and tracking. 3. Bitcoin Mining in Russia’s Shadow Territories Russia-linked shadow territories such as Donbas, Transnistria, and Abkhazia host large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. These regions benefit from near-zero energy costs and weak regulatory oversight. Mining produces new Bitcoin with no transaction history, which appeals to actors seeking clean coins. Analysts say these operations support sanctions evasion, influence campaigns, and personal enrichment. While no official reserve exists, the steady output of newly mined BTC creates a persistent shadow supply that feeds illicit and gray-market channels tied to sanctioned networks. 4. China’s Gray-Market Bitcoin Channels China banned public crypto trading in 2021, yet demand continues through over-the-counter desks and offshore platforms. Mainland investors access Bitcoin using USDT, private brokers, and nested exchange services. Chainalysis data shows OTC Bitcoin demand from mainland China has grown sharply since the ban. While analysts doubt systematic state accumulation, rumors persist that Chinese authorities still hold roughly 15,000 BTC from PlusToken seizures. Courts in China recognize Bitcoin as property, which allows continued informal use. This gray-market activity creates hidden demand rather than a centralized reserve, yet it still shapes global liquidity. 5. Sanctioned Darknet Markets and Exchanges Darknet platforms such as Hydra Market once handled massive Bitcoin flows tied to ransomware, drugs, and illicit services. Before its shutdown, Hydra processed billions of dollars in BTC and funneled funds through Russian exchanges. Blockchain researchers found that most illicit Bitcoin entering Russian platforms in 2019 traced back to Hydra . Although Hydra no longer operates, similar OFAC-listed entities continue to route Bitcoin through layered wallets and mixing services. These networks do not hold reserves in the traditional sense, yet they control significant shadow liquidity that analysts track through illicit flow analysis. Why Shadow Holdings Matter Shadow Bitcoin holdings influence liquidity, enforcement strategies, and geopolitical risk. Analysts rely on transaction patterns, seizure records and intelligence reports rather than balance sheets. As Bitcoin matures, scrutiny of hidden supply intensifies. The question remains simple yet unresolved. How much Bitcoin truly sits beyond the reach of public ledgers?",News|Bitcoin,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56969561,655048,1767862801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56969561.jpeg,Bitcoin Activity Decline Continues: Volume Downtrend Extends To 3 Years,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-activity-decline-volume-downtrend-3-years/,bitcoinist,"Data shows the Bitcoin transfer volume has been following a long-term decline, suggesting network activity has been shrinking despite price growth. Bitcoin Total Transfer Volume Has Been Going Down As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Total Transfer Volume has steadily been declining for Bitcoin since January 2023. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s becoming involved in transactions on the blockchain every day. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are ramping up their transfer activity. Such a trend may be a sign that trading interest in the asset is going up. On the other hand, the indicator registering a drop suggests holders are moving around fewer tokens, potentially because the market isn’t attracting their attention. Now, here’s the chart for the Bitcoin Total Transfer Volume (denominated in BTC) shared by Adler Jr that shows the trend in its 30-day and 365-day simple moving averages (SMAs) over the last decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Total Transfer Volume saw its 30-day SMA plummet during the 2022 bear market. This trend isn’t anything unusual, as bearish phases with long stretches of consolidation tend to be boring for investors, so they tend to shift their interest away from the cryptocurrency. The sharp decline in the metric ended at the start of 2023, but interestingly, even though BTC has seen a significant amount of price appreciation since then, the Total Transfer Volume has only continued to slide further, albeit this time at a more gradual pace. As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the 30-day SMA has been following this slow decline for three years now. The 365-day has followed a bit of a delayed trajectory, with its phase of gradual downtrend only beginning in late 2023, naturally due to the fact that it’s a long-term average. One factor behind the cooldown in Bitcoin network activity could be the introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States at the start of 2024. These investment vehicles allow for an off-chain route of investment into the asset, so the activity occurring on-chain no longer captures the full picture. In some other news, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap saw a breakout into the positive territory alongside the asset’s recent recovery above $94,000, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . The Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference between the asset’s price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair), so it being positive suggests that the former’s userbase, made up of American institutional entities, applied a higher amount of buying pressure than the latter’s global userbase during the price surge. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $90,700, up 5.5% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Activity|Bitcoin transaction volume|btc|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Large corporations are also accumulating Bitcoin, but sellers are also creating some hard tasks for the price. This is one of the reasons it is risky, and any investor asking what crypto to invest in now if they want to make lots of profit might rather invest in a newcomer that only costs $0.04 as it offers many practical uses. The Speculative Rise of Bitcoin Faces Obstacles Bitcoin is trying very hard to move beyond the $94,661 level, but it still has some tough blocks in the market. However, buying interest is increasing, as shown by charts, but the prices may fall suddenly as it finds difficulty staying above the $90,573 support line. The cryptocurrency headlines predicting that Bitcoin should reach $150,000 have to do with the larger banks purchasing more. But that does not necessarily make BTC the best cryptocurrency to have if you want a crypto to quickly grow in value in the future. Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in might need to look beyond the most well-known one. Mutuum Finance Presale: Early-Stage Exponential Value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a big shift in the world of investors who are on the hunt for the next big crypto opportunity. In a short while, the project has raised more than $19,680,000 and currently boasts more than 18,730 holders, meaning many individuals truly desire the token. It is currently in Phase 7 and is priced at only $0.04, which is a 300% increase from when it initially started, and the news about it is quickly circulating on the crypto scene that the current phase is selling out fast. The next price increase will be to $0.045 in Phase 8, so those asking about what cryptocurrency to buy now should invest before the time is up. Some predict that it may increase as high as $0.10 or even higher when it is released, making it a good contender for the best cryptocurrency investment right now. If MUTM reaches $0.10, an investor buying $1000 worth of the token today will see their position grow into $2500. Overcollateralized Lending and Direct Profit Participation Mutuum Finance is more than just having a rising token value, since you can also make money using its lending feature. It implements a secure loan approach called overcollateralized lending, ensuring that the entire process is stable while still allowing users to have earning opportunities. Investors have the ability to deposit $10,000 of ETH. With this, they would have the ability to borrow $7,500 to invest elsewhere while their ETH continues to grow. With this, they get the ability to fund their expenses without needing to sell their Ethereum. Lenders on the other hand have the ability to earn 10-15% APY. A $20,000 deposit would for instance grow into as much as $23,000 by the end of one year. Sustainable Rewards Through the Buy-&-Distribute Engine One major reason why Mutuum is the next big crypto is due to its brilliant mechanism of rewarding value to the people who actually hold the token. The platform harnesses the fees generated from the platform to purchase MUTM tokens from the market and then rewards users who had locked their tokens. In this way, success on the platform is directly linked to the rewards you will receive, helping investors to determine the best crypto to buy now. For instance, if the platform is generating a fee of $1 million, holding $5,000 would fetch fantastic rewards every few months. Such a platform forms the best crypto to invest in the coming days as it will make the prices rise. Finding a Niche in the High-Growth DeFi Era According to the latest bitcoin news, it might reach $150,000, but Mutuum Finance has something better to offer to smart investors. Mutuum Finance has a low presale price, with a functional lending platform and reward systems for holders. Mutuum Finance has quality attributes to offer: it has been audited and is running a major $100,000 giveaway campaign. If you are looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in during the next cycle, then MUTM is a good investment choice because its potential is based on actual use and not on predictions. This makes MUTM the best crypto to invest in.

For decades, global banks have relied on SWIFT to move money across borders, from dollars to yen or euros. While secure, SWIFT transactions can take days to settle. XRP, however, promises to cut that time to mere seconds. XRP’s edge lies in its unique blockchain, designed for speed and efficiency. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can suffer congestion and high fees, XRP acts as a bridge currency, enabling near-instant transfers between banks. As CNBC’s Sigalos notes, it settles transactions almost instantly, making it a practical, cost-effective alternative for cross-border payments and remittances, not just a speculative asset. Well, XRP’s speed and low fees are attracting investors and institutions alike. Outpacing Bitcoin and Ethereum recently, it handles thousands of transactions per second with minimal costs, making it a preferred choice for banks seeking faster, more efficient international transfers. Notably, XRP isn’t just theoretical, RippleNet is actively partnering with banks worldwide to streamline cross-border payments. Unlike crypto focused on speculation, XRP’s real-world adoption is driving institutional engagement, hinting at potential market momentum. XRP aims to revolutionize global banking with near-instant settlements, low fees, and scalable infrastructure. Former SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt predicts the network will adopt cryptocurrencies like XRP once regulations stabilize. Why does this matter? Well, XRP’s push to become the ‘SWIFT of banking’ isn’t just ambition, it’s a strategic move poised to redefine global money transfers. With its quiet outperformance, XRP signals growing influence that could extend well beyond crypto markets, attracting both investors and financial institutions. Conclusion XRP isn’t just another crypto, it’s redefining cross-border payments. With near-instant settlements, minimal fees, and rising institutional adoption, it challenges SWIFT’s decades-long dominance. Outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum quietly, XRP signals a shift in global finance toward speed, efficiency, and real-world utility.

Top 5 market coins Ethereum, XRP, and BNB are all trading in the red column, counting losses as much as 7% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin tumbled below $90,000 for a brief period on Thursday morning, while Ethereum tanked to $3,120, causing an unwelcome market bloodbath heading into the end of the week. At the time of this reporting, the largest coin by market cap had walked slowly back above $90,300. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin fell 2.7%, Ethereum lost 4.1%, while XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Hyperliquid declined as much as 4%. The overall crypto market has tanked by 2.9% during the same period, according to CoinGecko data. Crypto market turn to profit taking as liquidations take charge When Bitcoin attempted to surpass $94,000 earlier in the session, sellers took control of the market and pushed it back into the $91,000–$92,000 range. Some market watchers believe holders have begun profit-taking, coupled with long liquidations, which reached $150 million in the last four hours, according to CoinGlass data. Looking beyond Thursday’s losses, Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded weekly gains of 3.2% and 5.1%, respectively. Other tokens, including XRP, BNB, Solana, Tron, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Hyperliquid posted up to 20% gains in the seven days ending Wednesday. Bitcoin’s daily chart reveals that the asset briefly broke above its October downtrend into late December, only to face heavy resistance last Tuesday. According to market watchers on X, the crypto’s support levels now lie at $87,496 and $85,982–$86,291, based on retracement of the corrected October price rally and December lows. Bulls are holding their ground at the $83,712–$84,000 price marks, derived from the 2025 weekly low close and 38.2% retracement of the 2022 advance. If the sellers move close and breach this threshold, the market could witness another multi-month downtrend eyeing the next target between $78,342–$79,127, levels last seen in April 2025. CryptoQuant’s SOPR Ratio, which measures realized profitability between Long-Term Holders (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH), has also gone weak. The ratio dropped below 1 when Bitcoin tanked from highs near $110,000–$120,000 in October down to the current $91,000 status, which means short-term holders are realizing losses while long-term holders are shedding their November 2024 to Q4 2025 profits. Ethereum faces institutional selling pressure Ethereum’s US institutional interest is waning, owing to the $98.45 spot ETF outflow counted on Wednesday. Moreover, the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Gap , which compares prices on Coinbase to Binance, has flipped negative. The 14-day simple moving average dropped to -2.285, the lowest since February last year, spelling stronger selling pressures on US-based exchanges. The negative premium poses a hurdle for Ethereum to reclaim the $3,300 resistance level. As seen on CoinGecko’s charts, the crypto has struggled to shake off the effects of “doomtober,” where it peaked at $4,700 and fell steeply back to the $3,200 zone, failing to climb back up to $3,500 since November 15. US jobs data in play: Markets recovery could be delayed Crypto markets have been influenced by several factors in 2026, including geopolitical troubles between the US and Venezuela. However, the US labor market data released yesterday could have influenced today’s price shedding. As reported by the ADP, private employers added 41,000 new positions in December, a modest rebound after November’s revised decline of 29,000 jobs. ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson noted that “even in those sectors that shed jobs this month, the shedding was not as strong as last month,” because December’s gains were more positive than expected. Economists suggest that investors are now looking at both jobs data and future Supreme Court decisions on global tariffs to find signs that could affect how much risk they are willing to take in digital assets.

The current price action is caught in a narrow range, with several key levels keeping it in place. Traders are now watching for signs that the market is ready to break out. Dealer Hedging Keeps Price Contained Crypto Rover said Bitcoin is being “mechanically suppressed” by dealer hedging. In this setup, dealers are managing risk by selling into rallies and buying dips. This activity has kept the price locked between $90,000 and $95,000. At the top, $100,000 remains a major resistance. BITCOIN’S $100,000 WALL & WHY IT’S STUCK AT $93,000.

That could be the trigger for the next move. Until then, the hedging may keep the price range tight. Bitcoin has tested both sides of this zone but hasn’t shown a clear direction. In parallel, technical indicators suggest BTC remains range-bound. Chart analyst Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin needs a daily close above $94,000 or below $88,000 to confirm trend direction. At press time, BTC trades near $90,300, just below the midpoint of that range. The daily chart shows a rising support line that started forming in late 2025. Buyers continue to defend higher lows, but the $94,000 level has blocked further gains. Unless the price closes outside this range, it remains in consolidation. CME Gaps May Guide Next Steps Another analyst, Ted, shared a chart showing that the first CME futures gap around $90,700 has now been filled. The next possible target is the lower gap near $88,000–$88,500, which also lines up with a key support zone. Bitcoin tried to reclaim the $92,000–$94,000 area but faced heavy selling. If the asset drops again, the $88K zone could act as a magnet. Some traders expect that gap to be filled before a fresh move to the upside. Even so, spot market demand has led Bitcoin’s latest rebound, while futures traders appear cautious. This divergence shows that not all participants are positioned the same way. As reported by CryptoPotato, Bitcoin is still in the wider declining trend starting in September 2025, and the market is yet to prove a bottoming-out period. Analysts believe there is room to short-term rally to around $97,000 -107,000, yet believe that price will still fall below $70,000 later into the cycle.

Analyst Sees 2022-Style Bear Flag,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bounce-bull-trap-2022-style-bear-flag/,newsbtc,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the recent Bitcoin price action could echo the bear flag formation from the 2021-22 period. Bitcoin May Be Inside A Bear Flag Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a similarity that has been emerging between the Bitcoin price trend from 2021-22 and that from 2025-26. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Nears Neutral As Price Recovers Below is the chart shared by Martinez that puts the two periods side-by-side. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin saw a 54% drawdown during the first half of 2021, before witnessing another leg of the bull run to a new all-time high (ATH) above $69,000 later in the year. This high was followed by a bearish shift, with the price quickly sliding off as 2022 arrived. In 2022, the cryptocurrency observed consolidation inside a technical analysis (TA) pattern known as a Bear Flag. As the name suggests, Flag patterns look like a flag on a pole. In the case of a Bear Flag, the setup is oriented in the reverse direction; an initial sharp downward move represents the “pole,” while a parallel consolidation channel makes up for the “flag.” When the asset is trading inside the flag, it finds support at the lower level of the channel and resistance at the upper one. A break out of either of these bounds can signal a sustained move in that direction. Flags are considered to be continuation patterns, meaning that breakouts from them are likely to lead into the same direction as the preceding price trend. That is, a breakout could occur in the same direction as the pole. From the chart, it’s apparent that this appears to be what happened with Bitcoin back in 2022, with the price escaping downward from the Bear Flag with a sharp crash. Jumping to the recent Bitcoin price action, the cryptocurrency saw a similar trajectory in 2025 as in 2021, with an initial leg of the bull run leading to a second one that resulted in a new ATH (this time above $126,000). One difference, however, was that the legs of this bull market were separated by a price decline of just 30%. Since the latest record, BTC has once again faced a bearish transition, with its price plummeting to a low in November and beginning a period of consolidation. The analyst thinks that the latest phase of sideways movement could be occurring inside a Bear Flag, similar to the one from 2022.

The dispute surfaced after Bitcoin Magazine cited court paperwork that appeared to authorize liquidation of BTC tied to the Samourai Wallet case, and as blockchain movements showed the coins landing at Coinbase Prime, activity that traders often treat as a sale signal, even if it is not definitive on its own. Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis , one of Washington’s most vocal Bitcoin proponents, seized on the reporting to question why the government would be selling at all. “We can’t afford to squander these strategic assets while other nations are accumulating Bitcoin. I’m deeply concerned about this report,” she wrote on X, referencing the purported Samourai-linked sale. Why is the U.S. gov still liquidating bitcoin when @POTUS explicitly directed these assets be preserved for our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? We can’t afford to squander these strategic assets while other nations are accumulating bitcoin. I’m deeply concerned about this report. https://t.co/XW5WxsfliA — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 6, 2026 No Bitcoin Sold: USMS At the center of the controversy is Executive Order 14233 , which requires BTC obtained via criminal or civil forfeiture to be preserved as part of a US Strategic BTC Reserve. The reporting suggested the alleged sale clashed with that mandate. After DL News published its story, however, USMS directly denied that any such sale occurred, also criticizing the reporting process: [The USMS] has not sold the Bitcoin mentioned and it has no idea how Bitcoin Magazine would get that information. But they did not fact check nor contact us for information.” Furthermore, the US Marshals told DL News that “USMS cryptocurrency liquidations go through a multi-level approval process to ensure only forfeited digital assets that meet the requirements of Section D of Executive Order 14233 are disposed.” What sparked the confusion in the first place was a document described as an “Asset Liquidation Agreement” and an associated dollar figure—$6,367,139.69—tied to 57.5 BTC that were transferred on Nov. 3, 2025, in connection with the Samourai matter. Separately, on-chain tracking showed the same 57.5 BTC deposited to Coinbase Prime, a pattern that can be consistent with liquidation but “could not prove” a sale by itself. In the Samourai case , federal authorities arrested developers Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill in 2024, alleging the service operated as an unlicensed money transmitting business used by criminals. The report at issue centered on BTC that the developers paid to the Department of Justice as part of a guilty plea.

At the same time, the ETHBTC ratio sits at a key trendline near 0.035, with a possible breakout setup forming. Vitalik Buterin likens Ethereum to BitTorrent and Linux as he pushes “trustless” scaling vision Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin compared Ethereum to BitTorrent and Linux in a new post, arguing the network aims to combine decentralization with mass scale while keeping users independent from intermediaries. He said Ethereum’s goal is to deliver wide adoption without abandoning open access, and he framed Ethereum’s base layer as the long term “home” for people and organizations that want more autonomy. Buterin pointed to Linux as an example of software that stays free and open source while still being quietly relied on by billions of users, enterprises, and governments. He said Linux supports many mainstream distributions focused on adoption, while it also includes more “purist” versions that prioritize minimal design and technical power for users. He used that split to describe how Ethereum should support both broad usage and a high autonomy experience at the same time. He also used BitTorrent as a metaphor for how decentralized systems can scale, noting that businesses and governments use peer to peer distribution for large files. Buterin said Ethereum should mirror that combination by scaling through consensus while preserving what he called “trustlessness,” which he described as reducing reliance on middlemen. He added that enterprises often seek open, resilient systems for counterparty risk minimization, and he said that demand can align with Ethereum’s design goals. Buterin ended the post with a slogan used in Ethereum culture, writing, “This is the gwei,” a reference to a small unit of ether often used in transaction fee pricing. ETH to BTC ratio tests a long downtrend as a small bull flag forms near 0.035 Meanwhile, the ETHBTC ratio trades near 0.035 on a long term daily chart, and it now presses against a descending trendline that has capped relative strength for years. The line connects the major peaks from earlier cycles and keeps getting tested, so the current setup matters because ETH sits close to the same ceiling again. Ethereum to Bitcoin Ratio Chart. Source: StockCharts Price recently rebounded from a deep low near the prior base zone around 0.02, and then it pushed into a tighter consolidation. That consolidation looks like a short bull flag: ETHBTC climbed, then it started drifting sideways to slightly lower while holding a higher low. At the same time, the RSI in the panel above sits around 55, so momentum leans positive without showing an overheated condition. The next move likely depends on whether ETHBTC clears the trendline with a firm breakout and follow through. If buyers force a daily close above the falling line and keep the move, the ratio can rotate toward the next visible supply zone around 0.040 to 0.045, and then it can try to revisit the mid range area near 0.050 if the trend shift holds. That path would signal ETH outperforming BTC for a stretch, because the ratio would finally exit the long compression under resistance. However, the chart also supports a bearish outcome if the breakout fails. If ETHBTC rejects at the trendline again, then the flag can break down and pull price back toward the 0.033 area first. After that, a deeper slide can reopen the 0.030 zone, and then the market risks a return toward the longer term floor region near 0.02 if sellers regain control.",News|Crypto,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The $90,000 horizontal support level is holding up to now. Could the $BTC price switch on Thursday or Friday and start to rise back to the $94,000 resistance level, or might there be a further sting in the tail from the bears? $BTC price reaches bottom of bull flag Source: TradingView According to the 4-hour chart overhead, the $BTC price has reached the lower limit of the small bull flag. This coincides with strong horizontal support at $90,000, so the price will either fall through or it will bounce. If the bears win out and the price is forced through the supports, the major trendline and further horizontal support await below. If there is indeed a bounce, the price would probably head back to the top of the flag and a possible breakout. The Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom of the chart would go along with the bullish thesis, given that they are currently running along the bottom of their limit. Two strong support levels Source: TradingView As the $BTC price comes down to retest the bottom of the bull flag and the $90,000 horizontal support, it can be seen that the RSI indicator at the bottom of the chart is coming down to retest the uptrend line. If it falls through, this will be imitated in the price action. The price does have another big support below, in the shape of the bottom of the bear flag, the major ascending trendline, and the $88,000 horizontal level. There is the possibility of a quick candle wick down to these supports. All in all, there is a lot of support for the price here, and so it might be expected that the turn-around back to the upside could take place soon. The next few hours will be crucial. Bullish phase on the way? Source: TradingView The weekly chart view shows how important it is for the $BTC price to remain above the major ascending trendline, and if possible, the $90,000 horizontal support level. A hold above $90,000 at the end of this week would confirm this level as strong support on this high time frame, leading to a probable price rise from there. A breakout of the green ascending triangle would be a fantastic achievement for the bulls, also leaving the path open to the next target level of the all-important $108,000 resistance. Could this coincide with the top of the bear flag? This is a possibility, and if it did, this would be even stronger resistance for the bulls to overcome. At the bottom of the chart, the MACD illustrates that the indicator lines are straightening up, and are starting to head in more of a horizontal direction. At the same time, the pink histogram bars are continuing to reduce in size. This is pointing to a bullish phase on the horizon. If this happens, it just remains to be seen just how bullish it can be.

The shift marks a departure from historical patterns, in which whale selling typically triggered retail-driven crashes, suggesting a prolonged sideways trading period rather than the deep 50%-plus corrections seen in previous bear markets. Ju emphasized that institutional treasury holdings, particularly MicroStrategy’s 673,000 BTC position, have eliminated the conventional whale-retail sell cycle that previously dominated market dynamics. Capital has rotated into traditional stocks and precious metals, creating what he described as “ boring sideways ” price action for the coming months rather than dramatic downside volatility.

CryptoQuant data shows whale engagement remains relatively low even after the price recovery. This suggests limited distribution pressure from major holders, consistent with analysts’ characterization of a “ structurally healthy ” market environment. Source: CryptoQuant Retail investors also remain notably absent from the current recovery phase, with Bitcoin’s 30-day change in retail investor demand remaining deeply negative according to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn . Source: X/@JA_Maartun “ Retail is still missing in action ,” Maartunn noted, emphasizing that the crowd hasn’t returned to markets despite recent price stabilization. With little participation from the broader crowd and no clear push from whales, the market is stuck in an unusual state where both retail and large holders appear hesitant. In the middle of all this, Bitcoin recently dipped below $90,000 and filled its first CME gap, adding to uncertainty over whether prices could slide further toward the $88,000 area. Institutional Positioning Shows Early Recovery Signs Looking deeper, Glassnode reports Bitcoin entering 2026 following decisive drawdown and consolidation phases, with on-chain metrics pointing to reduced profit-taking pressure and structural stabilization around current range lows. “ In late December 2025, Realized Profit (7D-SMA) declined sharply to $183.8M per day, down from the elevated levels above $1B per day observed through much of Q4, ” the analytics firm stated, noting this deceleration in realized gains signaled exhaustion of distribution-side pressure. Source: Glassnode US spot ETF flows have also re-emerged following late-2025 outflows, while futures open interest has stabilized and begun turning higher after contracting from cycle highs above $50 billion. “ Positive impulses are becoming more frequent, indicating that ETF participants are once again transitioning from net distributors into marginal accumulators, ” Glassnode observed, describing the shift as institutional spot demand re-establishing itself as a constructive tailwind. Source: Glassnode Notably, the largest options open interest reset on record cleared more than 45% of outstanding positioning following the December 26 expiry , removing structural hedging constraints. “ Open interest fell from 579,258 BTC on December 25 to 316,472 BTC following the December 26 expiry ,” Glassnode noted, explaining the reset offers “ a cleaner read on sentiment, as new positions now reflect fresh premium being bought or sold rather than inherited exposure. “ Glassnode analysts also noted that dealer gamma has flipped short between $95,000 and $104,000, with new-year options flows tilting increasingly toward calls rather than defensive puts. Source: Glassnode They concluded that corporate treasury demand continues to provide stabilizing support beneath the price for now. However, it remains episodic rather than persistently structural, with accumulation bursts clustering around local pullbacks. Capital Rotation and Long-Term Outlook Speaking with Cryptonews, VALR CEO Farzam Ehsani attributes Bitcoin’s consolidation to capital flowing into precious metals, with gold and silver rising 69% and 161% respectively over the past year. “ Bitcoin and ETH will see capital inflows once the rally in precious metals comes to an end, ” Ehsani stated, projecting base-case targets of $130,000 for Bitcoin and $4,500 for Ethereum in Q1 2026 once precious metals momentum fades. In contrast, early Bitcoin investor Michael Terpin offers a different outlook, suggesting 2026 could mirror down years like 2014, 2018, and 2022. “ If the price follows historical patterns, we should bottom out around $60,000 in the early fall, ” Terpin noted, though acknowledging roughly 20% probability of an extended bull cycle reaching new highs before final correction. However, Ju offered a long-term perspective on patience, comparing Bitcoin investment to aging whiskey. Investing in Bitcoin is like aging whiskey. You need at least 4 years to get the depth. Open a bottle under a year old and you’ll never get that flavor. Age it as long as you can. Aren’t you curious what 16-year Bitcoin tastes like?

BlackRock Adds BTC and ETH for Three Straight Days BlackRock has accumulated Bitcoin and Ether for three consecutive days, according to onchain tracker Lookonchain. The account said the firm added a combined 9,619 BTC worth about $878 million and 46,851 ETH worth about $149 million over that period. BlackRock ETF Onchain Accumulation. Source: Arkham Intelligence Onchain labels and transfer logs also show fresh movements from Coinbase Prime linked wallets into BlackRock ETF related addresses. The records include multiple Bitcoin transfers into BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF tagged destination, alongside several Ether transfers into BlackRock’s ETHA Ethereum ETF tagged destination. The transfers appeared in batches within hours of each other, with repeated deposits of roughly 300 BTC at a time and several ETH moves that include 10,000 ETH sized transfers. While onchain data does not prove who initiated each transaction, the labels point to Coinbase Prime as the source and BlackRock ETF custody addresses as the destination in the latest series of movements. BTC and ETH Prices Move Higher, Then Pull Back During BlackRock Buying Bitcoin and Ether both posted gains during the three day period when onchain data showed BlackRock accumulating BTC and ETH through ETF linked wallets. At the start of the window, Bitcoin traded near the high $87,000 to $88,000 range, before pushing steadily higher over the following sessions. Price climbed above $90,000 and later tested the $93,000 to $94,000 area, marking the strongest levels of the week. As the buying period progressed, Bitcoin momentum slowed. After setting a short term high near $94,000, price began to roll over and moved lower into Jan. 7. By the end of the period, Bitcoin traded near $90,300, giving back part of the earlier advance but still holding above the levels seen before the accumulation phase began. The structure shows a higher high followed by a controlled pullback rather than a sharp reversal. Bitcoin Price Action, Three Day View. Source: CoinCodex Ether followed a similar path over the same days. ETH started near the $2,950 to $3,000 zone and advanced steadily as the sessions unfolded. Price broke above $3,100, then extended toward the $3,250 to $3,300 area, where it briefly stalled. This marked the strongest ETH levels during the three day stretch tied to BlackRock inflows.

BTC Struggles at $90K The primary cryptocurrency went on a solid ride starting on January 2 when it pumped from under $88,000 to just over $90,000. It briefly slipped below that level on Saturday morning after the US initiated a military operation against Venezuela and its president. However, it quickly rebounded and went on a roll in the following days. It jumped to $91,500 on Sunday, to over $93,000 on Monday, and tapped a multi-week peak of just under $95,000 on Tuesday morning. However, after gaining approximately $7,000 in just a few days, it was almost inevitable that it was due for a correction. At first, BTC slipped to $93,200, surged back up to $94,400, before it was driven to $91,200, and challenged $93,600 all within the span of hours. Nevertheless, the bears took complete control on Wednesday evening and Thursday for now, driving the asset below $90,000 earlier today. It struggles at around that level now, and its market cap has plunged to $1.8 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts is close to 57%. BTCUSD Jan 8.

ZEC is the biggest loser from the top 100 alts after one of its devs said they were leaving the project. PUMP followed suit, while PEPE, UNI, SUI, and CRO are next.

It has retreated by over 4% and continues to underperform other popular assets like gold and the stock market. Still, analysts are optimistic that the coin has more upside this year, with some expecting it to hit $300,000. Analysts are bullish on the Bitcoin price Bitcoin price remains in a technical bear market after falling by over 30% from its highest level in 2025. This crash happened as demand waned and as the January Effect started to end. In a note to CNBC, Standard Chartered analysts predicted that the coin may jump to $150,000 this year, much lower than the original estimate of $300,000. The bank reduced its target because it expects that Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies will not buy as aggressively as they did last year. Analysts at CoinShares predicted that Bitcoin would trade between $120,000 and $170,000, pointing to the potential interest rate cuts the Federal Reserve now that inflation has continued moving downwards. Maple Finance, a popular company in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, predicted that the coin would jump to $175,000, while Bit Mining expects it to rise to $225,000. Other bullish investors are those from companies like Nexo, FundStrat, and Strategy. Nexo analysts expect that the coin will rises to between $150,000 and $200,000. The bullish case for Bitcoin These Bitcoin price forecasts were delivered to CNBC , which collects them from some of the top companies in the industry. A closer look at the report identifies several reasons why the coin may continue rising this year. First, there is optimism that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates, especially when Donald Trump replaces Jerome Powell with a friendly Federal Reserve chairman. Bitcoin and other risky assets tend to do well when the Fed is cutting interest. Second, the US will have a stimulus package in the form of tax refunds as part of Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful. It is estimated that some taxpayers will receive thousands of dollars from the government, funds that may find their way to the crypto market. At the same time, Trump has hinted that the government will provide a stimulus dividend check using the tariff revenue the government will make. However, such funding will need congressional approval, which is highly unlikely. Third, the Supreme Court will likely cancel Donald Trump’s tariffs on Friday, noting that the president did not have the authority to impose it as the US was not in an emergency. Such a move would likely lead to lower prices, which would support the case for more cuts. Additionally, analysts believe that Bitcoin ETF inflows will continue this year as institutional investors pile in. One reason for this will be the passing of the CLARITY Act , which is expected to happen this year. Also, analysts believe that Bitcoin will play catch-up to the soaring gold price . Bitcoin price prediction and technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: TradingView A closer look shows that the Bitcoin price retreated after hitting the important resistance level at $94,516. It remains above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Bitcoin also remains above the Supertrend indicator, one of the most common bullish signs in technical analysis. Most importantly, it has formed an ascending triangle pattern, a common continuation pattern made up of a horizontal resistance and an ascending trendline. Therefore, the coin will likely rebound in the near term. The initial target price will be the upper side of the triangle followed by the psychological level at $100,000.

The reversal comes amid renewed pressure across major crypto exchange-traded products as the new year gets underway. The five US-listed XRP ETFs posted combined net outflows of $40.8 million on Wednesday. The selling was concentrated in a single product, with 21Shares’ TOXR recording $47.25 million in net outflows. That decline was partially offset by modest inflows of roughly $2 million each into funds managed by Canary, Bitwise, and Grayscale, resulting in a net negative reading for the day. XRP inflow momentum stalls after strong December The outflow marked a notable shift for XRP ETFs, which had been among the strongest performers in the crypto ETF space through December. By Dec. 30, spot XRP ETFs had notched a 29-day consecutive inflow streak, even as other crypto-linked exchange-traded products experienced sharp monthly redemptions driven by year-end portfolio rebalancing and profit-taking. Before Wednesday’s reversal, XRP ETFs had accumulated approximately $1.25 billion in net inflows since the launch of Canary’s XRPC fund on Nov. 13. The sustained demand had set XRP products apart from bitcoin and ether ETFs, which struggled to maintain consistent inflows over the same period. While Wednesday’s outflow breaks the streak, the data still suggest that XRP ETFs have retained a relatively sticky investor base compared with larger crypto funds, where flows have been more volatile in recent weeks. Bitcoin and Ether ETFs also reverse The weakness in XRP products coincided with broader selling pressure across the crypto ETF market. Spot bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined net outflow of $486 million on Wednesday, extending a reversal that began earlier in the week.

Early-year volatility highlights divergent trends ETF flow data from the opening days of January point to a sharp divergence by asset class. Spot bitcoin ETFs began the year with strong inflows of $471 million on Friday and $697 million on Monday, before reversing to $243 million in outflows on Tuesday and a deeper $486 million drawdown on Wednesday. Spot ether ETFs followed a similar trajectory, with inflows of $174 million on Friday, $168 million on Monday, and $114 million on Tuesday, before turning negative midweek. In contrast, smaller crypto ETFs have shown greater stability. Spot Solana ETFs continued to attract modest but consistent inflows during the first trading days of January, suggesting steadier positioning among investors in that segment. Dogecoin ETFs, meanwhile, recorded no notable net movement on Tuesday and Wednesday after starting the year with inflows of $2.3 million on Friday and $1.6 million on Monday.

The financial expert believes, however, that the cryptocurrency is going to appreciate against major fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar due to its fixed supply, which protects it from inflation. Bitcoin will not substitute gold due to crypto whales Bitcoin (BTC) is unlikely to displace gold or become a full-fledged alternative in the coming years because of the highly monopolized crypto market. That’s according to Oleg Vyugin, a prominent Russian economist, former deputy minister of finance and deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). Speaking for the popular YouTube channel of Russian blogger Alexander Sokolovsky this week, Vyugin assessed the prospects for the leading cryptocurrency. Theoretically, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could potentially approach that of the precious metal, the expert estimated. However, the digital coin’s strong dependence on the behavior of large holders and significant market manipulation makes it extremely unstable and difficult to predict. This, Vyugin emphasized, limits Bitcoin’s potential as a safe-haven asset. At the same time, the financier highlighted some of the crypto’s advantages over fiat currencies in the interview, quoted by Lenta.ru, Gazeta.ru and other Russian news outlets. He remarked, for example, that its limited supply is fixed at a “programmatic level” and is not subject to inflationary erosion, noting that Bitcoin-denominated assets retain their intrinsic value over time. Vyugin, who is a professor at Russia’s Higher School of Economics (HSE) national research university in Moscow, supposed that the prices of a given stock expressed in BTC in early 2026 and five years later will be comparable. This means that the rise in the cryptocurrency’s price would increase investor returns in dollar terms without a change in the fundamental value of the asset itself, he elaborated. With that in mind, the former high-ranking Russian official believes in the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin against the U.S. dollar. Russia set to regulate crypto investments in 2026 Bitcoin is leaving behind a turbulent year. The cryptocurrency with the largest market cap started 2025 at around $100,000 per coin and later crossed this threshold several times, reaching a new all-time high of over $124,000 and dropping below $90,000, the level where it’s currently trading in early 2026. Last year also marked a turning point in Russia’s policy toward crypto assets. Holdings and adoption have been growing amid sanctions limiting Russian access to global fiat channels and some foreign currency restrictions imposed to prevent capital flight earlier in the war with Ukraine . In a departure from its stubbornly conservative stance on decentralized digital money, the Bank of Russia proposed an “experimental legal regime” last spring, opening cross-border crypto payments for Russian firms. Initially announced as a three-year pilot, the ELR also gave a small group of “highly qualified” investors the opportunity to legally buy and trade Bitcoin, Ethereum and the like well as their derivatives . Then, the monetary authority suggested replacing the temporary arrangement with permanent and comprehensive regulation expected to be adopted by July 2026. Recognizing cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as “currency assets” as well as expanding investor access to the market are among the key proposals in its new regulatory concept published in late December. Crypto transactions have been on the rise throughout Eastern and Central Europe. According to Czech media reports earlier this week, domestic turnover in the country reached $750 million in 2025, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Quoted representatives of the industry there expect BTC to surpass its year’s record high in the coming months. And according to an estimate referenced by Russian media, Bitcoin’s peak price may exceed $140,000 in 2026. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The biggest number of liquidations ($45 million all in all) took place on the Hyperliquid cryptocurrency exchange , which also saw the single largest liquidation order, valued at $3.63 million. Adjusting for the new figures, a total of $464.44 million in crypto has been rekt in the past 24 hours, with more than 137,000 traders being affected. Total crypto liquidations chart. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin liquidations skyrocket as price drops Bitcoin was the most affected, accounting for $66.53 million, nearly double the $33.78 million recorded by Ethereum ( ETH ). As mentioned, the sell-off was driven primarily by Bitcoin’s flash crash, which dragged the price down to $89,600 and showed just how fragile leveraged trades can be in a volatile environment . Likewise, the liquidations followed significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , with $486 million in total daily net redemptions (the largest single-day outflow since November 20), recorded the day prior. In the aftermath, a number of digital assets have been left in the red on the daily chart. Bitcoin, although it’s again trading above $90,000, is still down 1.7%, while Ethereum fell 2.8%, now being priced at $3,125. XRP , which saw more than $6 million liquidated in the same hourly frame, has plummeted 6.8%, changing hands at $2.10. In sum, the broader crypto market has lost 2.19% in value, going from $3.21 trillion on January 7 down to $3.09 trillion at press time, according to CoinMarketCap .

MSTR won't dump any significant chunk of their 673k BTC. Money just rotated to stocks and… pic.twitter.com/Ha866TP857 — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) January 8, 2026 ‘BTC Sits in a Fragile Range’ Linh Tran, Senior Market Analyst at multi-asset broker XS.com , commented that BTC is “currently trading in a choppy range just above the $90,000 level, reflecting a fragile balance between monetary policy expectations, liquidity conditions, and global risk appetite.” The macro data environment from the US “provides a relatively supportive foundation,” Tran says. Still, given the ongoing downward pressure on BTC, “this support does not imply a strong upside breakout. Instead, it primarily helps limit the risk of a prolonged selling trend.” Moreover, geopolitical developments lead investors to reduce leverage or push the US dollar and yields higher. Therefore, Bitcoin may face downside pressure, says Tran. “Macroeconomic conditions currently support the view that Bitcoin is not being suffocated by interest rates, but they are still insufficient to generate a clear upside breakout,” according to the analyst. “An uptrend would only be firmly confirmed if labor market data continue to cool consistently, reinforcing expectations of looser financial conditions, or if institutional capital returns with enough strength to break the current stalemate.” However, the greatest risk to BTC “does not stem from any single geopolitical headline, but rather from the possibility that such shocks reignite inflation expectations, drive yields higher, and tighten financial conditions once again.” Should this happen, the crypto “would struggle to maintain its role as a beneficiary of the macro environment and may instead need to seek a new equilibrium at lower price levels than those currently prevailing.” Per Tran, “my personal view is that current data lean toward a scenario in which Bitcoin consolidates with a cautiously upward bias, rather than entering a deep bearish reversal. Bitcoin’s consolidation range for the remainder of January is likely to fluctuate between $88,000 and $95,000.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $90,235. The coin began the day with the intraday high of $92,847 before dipping below $90,000 to the intraday low of $89,797. BTC remains green over the 7-day period, increasing 3.2%. It’s been trading in the $87,491-$94,420 range. Now that the price had dipped to the $89,000 level, the doors opened for further pullbacks towards the $85,000 level. Yet, returning to $91,200 may give it a push towards $93,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,120. Starting the day with $3,255, the price gradually decreased to $3,099. Over the past week, ETH fell by 5.1%, moving between $3,292 and $2,973. It already briefly dropped below $3,000, creating opportunities for further decreases towards the $2,800 level. Managing to climb back above $3,300 may give it a push upwards. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has moved lower, following a couple of days of unchanged levels. The crypto fear and greed index currently stands at 43 today , compared to 49 yesterday. While it is still in the neutral territory, it’s worth noting that the metric now borders the fear zone. As worry rises among market participants, it is possible we’ll see the index back in the fear zone in the near-term. ETFs Turn Red The US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded the highest amount of outflows since late November 2025. On Wednesday, they posted negative flows of $486.08 million . With this, the total net inflow pulled back to $57.05 billion. Six of the twelve BTC ETFs posted outflows. Among these, Fidelity’s $247.62 million is the highest.

Bitbo is a specialized, real-time Bitcoin dashboard designed to provide investors with high-level analytics, live price action, and on-chain data visualization. It is not a cryptocurrency or a stock itself; rather, it is a sophisticated monitoring tool used by traders to track the health of the Bitcoin network. As of January 8, 2026 , the platform has seen a surge in traffic as investors closely monitor Bitcoin’s price movements around $90,036 USD (approx. ₹80,83,579 INR ) amidst heightened global volatility. Why Is the Bitbo Dashboard Trending Now? The platform’s popularity in early 2026 is driven by a confluence of macroeconomic shifts and specific market catalysts that have made real-time data essential for decision-making. Geopolitical Instability: Recent updates regarding U.S. intervention in Venezuela have spiked global risk appetite. Investors are flocking to Bitbo to monitor how these events correlate with Bitcoin’s performance as a “safe haven” asset alongside gold. New Year Capital Reallocation: Following a tax-related sell-off in late 2025 , the market is experiencing aggressive capital inflows. Traders use Bitbo to spot early signs of institutional accumulation as portfolios are rebalanced for the new year. Bullish Sentiment & Options Data: With Bitcoin trading near $90k , there is significant interest in call options betting on a break past $100,000 . The dashboard’s cycle models are critical for traders validating whether technical indicators support this potential all-time high. What Are the Key Financial Metrics for Bitcoin in 2026? As tracked on the Bitbo dashboard, the current financial landscape for Bitcoin reflects a mature and highly active market: Current Price: Approximately $90,036 USD (-1.22% in the last 24h). Market Capitalization: The global crypto market cap stands at roughly $3.16 trillion USD , signaling massive liquidity. 24-Hour Volume: Trading volume has surged to $40.45 billion USD , indicating high turnover and active participation. Circulating Supply: Approximately 19.97 million BTC are currently in circulation, inching closer to the 21 million hard cap. What Unique Features Does Bitbo Offer? Founded in 2020 by Christopher Gimmer and Marc Chouinard , Bitbo distinguishes itself from generic trackers with specific, high-value tools: Power Law Rainbow Chart: A proprietary visualization that combines logarithmic growth models with historical sentiment bands. It helps long-term investors determine if Bitcoin is currently “overbought” or “undersold.” Real-Time Economics: The dashboard aggregates key economic indicators (like inflation rates and treasury yields) alongside crypto data to provide a holistic view of the macro environment. Physical Goods: Uniquely, the Bitbo brand also markets physical lifestyle products, such as high-quality riding gloves, differentiating it from purely digital-only analytics firms. Frequently Asked Questions Is Bitbo a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet? No, Bitbo is purely a data analytics dashboard. You cannot buy, sell, or store Bitcoin directly on the website. However, the name is often confused with the BitBox02 , a Swiss-made hardware wallet that allows for secure cold storage of cryptocurrencies. How does the Bitbo Power Law Rainbow chart help traders? The Power Law Rainbow chart uses historical price data and logarithmic regression to project potential price ranges. It color-codes price zones (e.g., “Accumulate,” “HODL,” “Bubble”) to help investors visually identify where Bitcoin sits in its long-term market cycle, offering a strategic advantage over simple price charts. Why is Bitcoin trending on Bitbo in January 2026? Bitcoin is trending due to a “perfect storm” of drivers: geopolitical tension in Venezuela , post-2025 tax-loss harvesting reversals, and strong technical indicators suggesting a rally toward $100,000 . Bitbo has become a primary destination for tracking these real-time shifts. Conclusion Bitbo has solidified its role as an essential utility for the serious Bitcoin investor in 2026 . By providing clarity through tools like the Power Law Rainbow chart and real-time macro data, it empowers users to navigate complex market conditions driven by geopolitical events and institutional flows. For anyone looking to move beyond simple price checking and understand the why behind market movements, leveraging Bitbo’s analytics is a crucial step in executing a data-driven investment strategy.

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $90,036 USD (–2.5% in the last 24 hours) as of January 8, 2026 . The crypto market is facing a sharp correction driven by macroeconomic headwinds, specifically the release of softer-than-expected U.S. employment data . This report has dampened investor hopes for an immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cut, causing a pivot away from risk assets. This analysis breaks down the key market drivers, current technical levels, and what analysts predict for the weeks ahead. What Are the Key Drivers Behind the Drop? The decline is not isolated to a single event but rather a “perfect storm” of economic data and institutional movements. Federal Reserve Policy Shift: Weak job openings data (falling to 7.1 million) has ironically decreased the probability of a January 2026 rate cut. The Fed remains divided, leading traders to price in “higher for longer” rates, which typically strengthens the dollar and weighs on Bitcoin. Geopolitical Instability: Heightened tensions involving U.S. intervention in Venezuela and trade disputes in Asia have reduced global risk appetite, causing capital to flee volatile assets like crypto in favor of traditional safe havens. ETF Outflows: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded significant outflows (over $243 million in recent sessions), signaling a cooling of the institutional demand that fueled the early New Year rally. Profit-Taking at Resistance: After failing to break the $94,000–$95,000 resistance zone, short-term traders and some large holders (“whales”) moved funds to exchanges to lock in gains, triggering a technical sell-off. Short-Term Outlook: Key Support and Resistance Levels Technical analysts remain cautious in the short term, with volatility expected to persist until the release of the non-farm payrolls report later this week. Key Support Levels ($88k – $86k): The immediate floor for Bitcoin sits between $88,000 and $90,000 . A confirmed break below this range could expose the $84,000 level, which serves as critical mid-term support. Resistance Levels ($94k): For a bullish reversal, Bitcoin must decisively reclaim the $92,000 level and break through the heavy sell wall at $94,000 . Whale Activity Divergence: While price action is bearish, some on-chain data suggests a divergence: while retail investors are selling, certain “smart money” whale wallets have been accumulating during this dip, viewing the sub-$90k region as a discount before the next leg up to **$100,000**. Frequently Asked Questions Why did U.S. employment data cause Bitcoin to drop? Positive or “sticky” employment data often implies the economy is strong enough to handle higher interest rates. When rates stay high, safer assets like Treasury bonds become more attractive compared to risky assets like Bitcoin, leading to a sell-off. Will Bitcoin recover to $100,000 in January 2026? While the short-term trend is bearish, the long-term outlook remains positive. Many analysts believe that once the market digests the Fed’s January decision and geopolitical fears subside, the structural bull run could resume, potentially targeting $100,000 later in Q1 2026. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Trading carries risk, but technical analysts suggest watching the $88,000 support level. If the price stabilizes there, it may present a favorable entry point for long-term investors. However, waiting for the volatility from the non-farm payrolls data to settle is often recommended. Conclusion Bitcoin’s drop to $90,036 in early 2026 highlights the asset’s continued sensitivity to U.S. macroeconomic policy. While the delay in Fed rate cuts and recent ETF outflows present immediate hurdles, the underlying accumulation by long-term holders suggests the broader bull market remains intact. Investors should closely monitor the $88,000 support zone and upcoming labor reports to gauge the market’s next decisive move.

Rather than signaling weakness, the current pause in momentum reflects a controlled correction within a broader bullish structure. This phase has unfolded in sync with the wider crypto market, particularly Bitcoin’s short-term cycle, suggesting coordinated market behavior rather than isolated volatility. According to crypto analyst Tara, XRP’s price action has developed exactly as anticipated within an Elliott Wave framework . She explains that the asset pushed higher into a corrective subwave B, reaching the $2.30 level, which aligns precisely with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. That zone acted as firm resistance, triggering a pullback that marked the transition into the final wave of the correction instead of a breakdown in trend. #XRP EXACTLY as expected. It pushed up for subwave B right to the $2.30 (.5) resistance and is now on the final wave of the correction RIGHT at the textbook .382 support at $2.18. #XRP needs to hangout here while #BTC finishes up- almost done with this short-term correction. The… pic.twitter.com/1I0BwSJaWA — TARA (@PrecisionTrade3) January 7, 2026 Key Support Holds at a Textbook Fibonacci Level After rejecting $2.30, XRP retraced into a critical support region near $2.18. Tara identifies this level as the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, a zone that often acts as a stabilizing point in healthy corrective structures. XRP’s ability to hold this level reinforces the view that the market remains constructive rather than fragile. She stresses that XRP does not need to rush higher from this area. Instead, price consolidation around $2.18 allows the structure to mature while Bitcoin completes its own short-term corrective move. In her assessment, Bitcoin appears close to finishing this phase, which could soon provide tailwinds for XRP and the broader altcoin market. Updated Wave Targets Signal Higher Levels Ahead With the correction low now defined, Tara recalculated XRP’s next upside objective. She places the projected subwave 5 peak near $2.58, a level derived from current wave measurements. This target sits comfortably within the previously established resistance range between $2.49 and $2.66, an area where XRP traded before the correction took shape. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This zone carries added significance because a move into it would complete five full waves of the current structure. Tara explains that this completion would mark the end of the corrective sequence and confirm the first impulsive wave of a new trend. In classical Elliott Wave theory, such transitions often precede broader continuation moves rather than short-lived rallies. Market Structure Remains Firm and Orderly XRP’s broader structure continues to reflect balance and control. Price respects key Fibonacci levels, volatility remains measured, and the correction shows proportional depth rather than emotional selling. These characteristics typically appear during market resets, not trend reversals. As long as XRP maintains support near $2.18 and Bitcoin finalizes its corrective phase, the technical outlook remains intact. Traders now look for renewed momentum and volume expansion to confirm the next leg higher as XRP positions itself for a potential continuation of its emerging trend.

The spot XRP exchange-traded funds have seen their first red day on January 7, as the underlying asset’s price has tumbled by 13% since its local peak earlier this week. XRP ETF Streak Broken The first spot XRP ETF was released by Canary Capital on November 13, 2025, and it set the record for the highest daily trading volume throughout the year. Four more such financial vehicles followed suit, launched by Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares. The products attracted roughly $1 billion in just over a month. Moreover, they continuously outperformed all other crypto ETFs within this timeframe as they were consistently in the green. while the BTC and ETH funds were losing billions of dollars. More specifically, the spot Ripple ETFs hadn’t seen a single day with more net outflows than inflows since November 13, but this impressive streak came to an end yesterday. Data from SoSoValue shows that investors pulled out $40.80 million from the funds, reducing the cumulative net inflows to $1.20 billion. This was the longest such streak for ETFs tracking the performance of digital assets. Solana’s ETFs are next, as they were in the green for just under a month after the first one debuted in late October. In contrast, both the BTC and ETH funds saw numerous red days after launch, especially those tracking the largest altcoins. XRP Rejected The consistent ETF net inflows were among the reasons that drove the underlying asset to a new multi-week peak a few days ago. XRP went on the run at the start of the new year, skyrocketing by 30% from under $1.90 to $2.41. However, it faced a violent rejection at that point and has lost over 13% of value. It now struggles to remain above $2.10. While one of the reasons for this substantial nosedive could be related to the overall market retracement in the past day, another one could be attributed to the broken streak above. Investor sell-offs not only impact the asset’s price, but they can also serve as an example for others to follow suit. Nevertheless, analysts such as Steph Is Crypto continue to be bullish on XRP in the long run, indicating that the RSI has just “flashed a powerful signal” for its future price performance. On the weekly chart, $XRP just flashed a powerful signal. The weekly RSI has broken back above its moving average. This is important because it usually only happens when momentum starts to shift decisively in favor of buyers.

With the market holding its structure, insights from Quantum Models suggest that Wave (3) is underway, pointing toward a near-term target around $104,000. Q-Structure Confluence Holds Firm, Keeping The Bullish Bias Alive Elliott Chart, in a recent update, highlighted that Bitcoin remains firmly supported around the Q-Structure λ₅ confluence zone, a level that continues to underpin the broader bullish outlook. This support area has absorbed selling pressure, suggesting that larger participants are still defending key levels despite recent volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips Further, Setting Up a High-Stakes Support Moment Upon closer examination of market structure, the recent pullback is now being classified as a complex corrective phase rather than the beginning of a larger downtrend. Specifically, the correction is interpreted as Intermediate Wave (2), unfolding through a Zigzag W | Zigzag X | Triangle Y setup. With this corrective pattern largely resolved, Elliott Chart highlights that Intermediate Wave (3) is now in progress, with Minor Waves 1 and 2 already taking shape. This suggests the market is building the foundation for a more decisive move higher. The critical piece still developing is an impulsive Minor Wave 3. Historically, this wave tends to be the strongest and most aggressive part of an advance. If it unfolds as expected, the model points to a near-term Q-Target around $104,444, generated using the Q-Structure λᵣ projection. This bullish scenario is derived from insights within the Quantum Models framework and is not based on short-term noise. Notably, this potential trend reversal was first projected back on November 15, during Bitcoin’s decline. Sharp Flush Finds Strong Demand At Key Levels Delving into current price actions, CyrilXBT disclosed that Bitcoin experienced a sharp flush but found buyers precisely at a critical support level, allowing the price to stabilize and gradually grind higher. This reaction indicates that the recent sell-off was absorbed by strong demand rather than driven by panic selling, reflecting healthy market participation from buyers at key zones. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Recovery Extends Into 2026 as Charts Hint at Another Leg Higher This type of price action highlights absorption, not fear. What stands out most is the higher-low structure that has emerged following the drop. This formation is important because it signals that downside pressure is weakening. As long as Bitcoin continues to hold within this reclaimed range, the risk of a deeper sell-off diminishes, and the market maintains the potential for further upward moves. Sideways or consolidating price action at these levels is constructive for the overall crypto market. Maintaining this structure sets the stage for a healthier, more sustainable advance for Bitcoin rather than a rushed or volatile rebound.

The digital asset, which has experienced significant volatility throughout 2025, now faces a critical inflection point that market participants are watching with intense scrutiny. This analysis, published on March 15, 2025, by the Negentropic X account representing Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, centers on a proprietary Risk Index that has historically signaled major turning points in Bitcoin’s price cycles. The current market behavior will determine whether this represents a healthy mid-cycle pullback or the beginning of a more substantial bearish phase. Understanding the Bitcoin Correction and Glassnode’s Risk Index Glassnode’s analysis focuses specifically on a metric they term the Risk Index, which quantitatively measures profit-taking pressure across the Bitcoin network. This sophisticated on-chain indicator tracks the behavior of various market participants, particularly long-term holders and recent buyers, to gauge selling momentum. Essentially, the index rises when investors are actively realizing profits from their Bitcoin holdings, creating downward price pressure. Conversely, the index falls when selling activity diminishes, suggesting that market participants are either holding through volatility or lack the incentive to sell at current prices. Historically, this metric has provided valuable signals about market psychology and exhaustion points. Major Bitcoin corrections throughout previous market cycles, including those in 2017, 2019, and 2021, have frequently concluded shortly after the Risk Index declined below the 25 threshold and approached zero. This pattern suggests that when profit-taking becomes exhausted—when nearly everyone who wants to sell has already done so—the market finds a natural bottom and begins its recovery phase. The current analysis notes that Bitcoin’s Risk Index is approaching this critical historical threshold once again, placing the market at a decisive crossroads. The Mechanics of Market Exhaustion The underlying principle behind the Risk Index involves analyzing the age and cost basis of coins being moved on the blockchain. When older coins, typically held at lower prices, begin moving to exchanges or being sold, it indicates profit-taking by long-term investors. This activity often correlates with local market tops or significant corrections. Glassnode’s methodology aggregates this data into a normalized index that provides a clearer picture of overall market stress than price action alone can offer. The firm’s extensive historical database, spanning Bitcoin’s entire existence, gives this analysis particular weight within the cryptocurrency research community. Historical Context of Bitcoin Corrections and Current Parallels Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its history, each with distinct characteristics but often following similar psychological and on-chain patterns. The current market environment draws particular comparison to the April-May 2025 correction mentioned by Glassnode’s analysts. That earlier downturn saw Bitcoin decline approximately 22% from its local high before finding support and resuming its upward trajectory. The recovery was preceded by similar signals from on-chain metrics, including a decline in exchange inflows and a stabilization in the realized profit/loss ratio. Other historical precedents provide additional context. The 2021 cycle, for instance, featured multiple corrections exceeding 30% during its bull market phase, each followed by new all-time highs. The 2017 bull run experienced even sharper pullbacks, with one notable correction exceeding 40% before the final parabolic advance. What these historical episodes share is a pattern of investor exhaustion followed by renewed accumulation, a cycle that Glassnode’s Risk Index aims to capture quantitatively. The current question is whether 2025 will follow this established pattern or deviate due to unique macroeconomic or regulatory conditions. Historical Bitcoin Corrections and Risk Index Levels Period Correction Depth Risk Index Low Recovery Time to New High Q3 2017 ~40% Approached 0 8 weeks Q2 2019 ~35% Below 25 12 weeks Q2 2021 ~54% Below 25 14 weeks April-May 2025 ~22% ~30 6 weeks Current (March 2025) Ongoing Nearing 25 TBD The Critical Price Level and Potential Scenarios Glassnode’s analysts have identified a specific price threshold that could serve as a catalyst for the next market phase. They note that a daily close above $94,700 would signal a potential short-term bullish reversal. This price level represents both a technical resistance area and a psychological benchmark for traders. Achieving this close would suggest that buying pressure has overcome the recent selling momentum, potentially setting the stage for a test of previous highs. The analysts project that such a move could support a scenario where Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high within the next four to eight weeks, following the historical pattern of post-correction rallies. Conversely, failure to hold key support levels and a continued decline in the Risk Index without corresponding price stabilization would suggest a different outcome. This scenario might indicate that the current correction represents more than a mid-cycle pause—potentially the beginning of a more significant downturn influenced by external macroeconomic factors. Several elements could contribute to this deeper correction scenario: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Rising interest rates or inflationary pressures in traditional markets Regulatory Developments: Unfavorable cryptocurrency legislation in major economies Market Structure Changes: Shifts in derivatives market leverage or institutional participation On-chain Capitulation: Prolonged selling by long-term holders beyond typical profit-taking The Role of Market Psychology at Inflection Points Market inflection points represent moments where collective psychology shifts decisively. The current juncture in Bitcoin’s price action exemplifies this phenomenon. On one side, optimistic investors view the correction as a buying opportunity, anticipating the historical pattern of recovery. On the other, cautious participants see potential warning signs of a broader market top. Glassnode’s data-driven approach aims to cut through this psychological noise by focusing on observable on-chain behavior rather than sentiment alone. The firm’s reputation for rigorous analysis lends authority to their assessment of this critical moment. Broader Market Implications and Expert Perspectives The outcome of Bitcoin’s current inflection point carries implications beyond the cryptocurrency itself. As the dominant digital asset by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s trajectory often influences the broader cryptocurrency market. A decisive bullish reversal could renew interest in alternative cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects, while a deepening correction might trigger risk-off behavior across the sector. Institutional investors, who have increased their cryptocurrency exposure significantly since 2023, pay particular attention to these technical and on-chain indicators when making allocation decisions. Other market analysts have noted similar critical levels in their assessments. Several trading firms have identified the $90,000-$95,000 zone as a crucial battleground between bulls and bears. Options market data shows increased interest in both put and call options around these price levels, indicating uncertainty about the near-term direction. Meanwhile, exchange flow data from other analytics providers shows a mixed picture—some exchanges are experiencing net inflows (potential selling pressure) while others see net outflows (potential accumulation). This divergence underscores the contested nature of the current price level. Conclusion Bitcoin stands at a critical inflection point according to Glassnode’s analysis of their proprietary Risk Index. The metric’s approach toward the historically significant threshold of 25 suggests the current correction may be nearing a resolution point. Market participants should monitor both the Risk Index progression and the key price level around $94,700 for signals about the next directional move. Whether this represents a mid-cycle correction similar to April-May 2025 or the beginning of a more significant downturn will likely become clearer in the coming weeks as these technical and on-chain signals resolve. The analysis from Glassnode’s co-founders provides a data-driven framework for understanding this pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s market cycle, emphasizing the importance of on-chain metrics alongside price action when assessing market health. FAQs Q1: What is the Glassnode Risk Index and how does it work? The Glassnode Risk Index is an on-chain metric that measures profit-taking pressure in the Bitcoin market. It analyzes the movement of coins based on their age and cost basis to determine whether investors are realizing profits. High readings indicate strong selling pressure, while low readings suggest seller exhaustion. Q2: Why is the threshold of 25 significant for the Risk Index? Historical analysis shows that major Bitcoin corrections have frequently concluded after the Risk Index falls below 25 and approaches zero. This level has signaled seller exhaustion and market bottoms in previous cycles, making it a key watch point for analysts. Q3: What would a daily close above $94,700 indicate for Bitcoin? According to Glassnode’s analysis, a daily close above $94,700 would signal a potential short-term bullish reversal. This price action could support a scenario where Bitcoin tests previous highs and potentially reaches a new all-time high within four to eight weeks. Q4: How does the current correction compare to previous Bitcoin market cycles? The current correction shares characteristics with mid-cycle pullbacks in previous bull markets, particularly the April-May 2025 correction. However, each cycle has unique elements, and the current macroeconomic environment differs from past cycles, requiring careful analysis of multiple factors. Q5: Who are Jan Happel and Yann Allemann? Jan Happel and Yann Allemann are the co-founders of Glassnode, a leading blockchain data and intelligence platform. They regularly share market insights through their Negentropic X account, providing data-driven analysis of cryptocurrency market trends based on on-chain metrics.

This involves an investigation into companies allegedly operating scams using these crypto kiosks , defrauding customers in the process. Missouri AG Launches Investigation Into Companies Using Bitcoin ATMs In a press release , Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway announced that her office had launched a statewide investigation into companies that were operating Bitcoin ATMs . She stated that this investigation was due to national concerns of deceptive fee structures and bad actors using them to defraud customers. The AG Hanaway said they had received reports of “devastating” new scams involving Bitcoin ATMs that prey on Missourians. She further remarked that her office is investigating these allegations regarding hidden fees and deceptive charges on these machines and will hold bad actors accountable. The AG gave a hint into how these scam Bitcoin ATM operators work, noting that the scammers might call claiming that one is in legal trouble and must pay using the crypto ATMs immediately or face charges. Hanaway urged those who have been victims of this fraud to reach out to her office. As part of the action against these bad actors, the Attorney General’s office has already issued five Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to Bitcoin ATM companies across Missouri. These crypto kiosk companies are said to be engaging in practices that may be in violation of the state’s consumer protection laws. The CIDs also require these companies to disclose anti-fraud policies and procedures. Companies Currently Under Investigation The Missouri AG office listed GPD Holdings, Rockitcoin, Bitcoin Depot, Athena Bitcoin, and Byte Federal as Bitcoin ATM companies currently under investigation. These businesses are said to each own and operate numerous crypto kiosks located across Missouri . These kiosks typically allow customers to transact in crypto, such as BTC, rather than U.S. dollars. The AG’s office noted that these transactions are nonrefundable and difficult to trace, making them the preferred method for scammers to prey on vulnerable Missourians. Interestingly, BTC Depot, one of the companies under investigation, recently reached a settlement in Maine over crypto ATM scams. According to an ABC News report , the crypto kiosk vendor agreed to pay $1.9 million to the state as part of a settlement to compensate victims of fraud. The rise of Bitcoin ATM scams has led states such as Arizona to enact new laws to crack down on them. The state had reported that residents lost about $177 million to schemes tied to crypto ATMs. The FBI has also warned about the scam, revealing that Americans lost over $330 million to these crypto ATM scams last year. This represents a significant increase from the $250 million in losses recorded in 2024.",Bitcoin|ABC News|AG Hanaway|Athena Bitcoin|ATM|bitcoin|Bitcoin Depot|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Byte Federal|Catherine Hanaway|CIDs|Civil Investigation Demands|FBI|RockItCoin|The Missouri AG,BTC|REGULATION|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56979056,https://cryptonews.com/?p=471749,1767883271,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56979056.jpeg,"XRP ETFs Hit With $41M in Outflows — First Since Launch, But Why Now?",https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-xrp-etfs-first-net-outflows-41m/,cryptonews,"U.S. spot XRP exchange-traded funds recorded their first day of net outflows since launch this week, ending a 36-day stretch of uninterrupted inflows and raising questions about timing rather than long-term demand. Data from SoSoValue shows that the five listed XRP products posted a combined net outflow of $40.8 million on Wednesday, January 7, marking the first negative daily print since trading began in mid-November. XRP ETFs Outflow January 7 Source: SoSoValue One ETF Drove the Outflows as the Rest Held Steady The reversal was driven almost entirely by one product, as the 21Shares XRP ETF, TOXR, saw $47.25 million exit the fund in a single session, equivalent to roughly 21.66 million XRP. That move pushed its cumulative flows into negative territory at minus $8.18 million, although the product still holds nearly $258 million in net assets. Source: SoSoValue Other XRP ETFs moved in the opposite direction, with Canary’s XRPC, Bitwise’s XRP fund, and Grayscale’s GXRP each recording modest daily inflows of around $2 million, while Franklin’s XRPZ was flat on the day. Despite the headline outflow, the broader picture remains intact since launch; XRP ETFs have attracted roughly $1.20 billion in cumulative net inflows and now hold about $1.53 billion in total net assets. Canary Capital’s XRPC ETF debuted with $58 million in volume, the strongest first-day performance of any ETF launched this year. #XRP #ETF https://t.co/27gv7vtyO9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 That represents around 1.16% of XRP’s total market capitalization. Trading activity across the products reached $33.74 million on the day, broadly in line with recent averages. The timing of the outflows appears closely linked to broader market conditions rather than XRP-specific weakness. XRP’s price fell about 6.4% over the past 24 hours to around $2.10, pulling back from a recent high near $2.25. The move came alongside a sharp drop in trading volume, which fell more than 30% day over day to $4.14 billion, pointing to reduced short-term participation rather than panic selling. Source: Cryptonews More importantly, XRP ETFs were not alone, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs also recording significant outflows on the same day. Spot Bitcoin funds saw $486 million leave, extending a two-day drawdown that has now exceeded $700 million. Ethereum ETFs posted their first net outflow day of 2026, losing $98.5 million after starting the year with strong inflows. The synchronized nature of the moves suggests portfolio-level repositioning rather than a sudden loss of confidence in XRP products. XRP ETFs Slow in January, On-Chain Data Points to Stability The structure of the ETF flows also matters, as November and December accounted for the bulk of that growth, with nearly $1.17 billion added during those two months. In January, inflows slowed but remained positive overall, even after this week’s outflow, as by the week ending January 7, XRP ETFs had still added $24.4 million on a net basis. On-chain data adds further context, with CryptoQuant data showing that whale flows of XRP to Binance have declined steadily since peaking in mid-December. Whale XRP Flows to Binance Decline, Signaling Reduced Selling Pressure “Decline in whale flows since mid-December, although still at relatively high levels, is a positive sign in the medium term, as it reduces the likelihood of a sudden sell-off.” – By @ArabxChain pic.twitter.com/P646tKZe1u — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 8, 2026 While whales still account for a majority of exchange flows, their share has fallen from above 70% late last year to about 60%. Retail behavior has remained relatively stable, with no sign of a broad panic exit. At the same time, Santiment data points to a surge in large XRP transactions, with transfers above $100,000 hitting a three-month high earlier this week, a sign of heightened positioning rather than a clear directional bet. Source: Santiment Together, the data points to a market digesting gains rather than breaking down. XRP remains up more than 13% over the past seven days and nearly 10% year over year. The ETF outflows appear to reflect short-term profit-taking, broader ETF rebalancing, and softer volumes across crypto markets, rather than a structural reversal in demand.

The crypto king remains about 28% below its October 2025 all-time high near $126,000 . Against this backdrop, industry executives and investors have released some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions yet for 2026. Source: CoinCodex Estimates range widely, from a low of $75,000 to a high of $225,000. What explains such a dramatic spread? After a strong rally last year, followed by a sharp correction, Bitcoin now moves within a defined consolidation range between $84,000 and $94,000. Analysts describe this phase as a pause rather than a resolution. Many point to macroeconomic uncertainty, shifting monetary policy and institutional positioning as defining forces for the year ahead. Arthur Hayes Flags Volatility Before Liquidity - Driven Upside Arthur Hayes, former BitMEX co-founder, expects heightened volatility before any sustained upside. Hayes stated that Bitcoin could fall toward the $80,000 to $85,000 zone if equity markets correct and Treasury yields rise. He links Bitcoin’s recent decline from above $125,000 to tightening liquidity conditions rather than crypto-specific weakness. Hayes described Bitcoin as a forward-looking indicator of liquidity stress. He said Bitcoin often reacts before policymakers respond. Under his framework, renewed liquidity injections could later propel Bitcoin toward $200,000 to $250,000. Still, he emphasized uncertainty and shifting market conditions. Can liquidity alone reverse current pressure? Cathie Wood Holds Firm Tom Lee also has his outlook after Bitcoin’s late-2025 pullback. He expects Bitcoin to hit $250,000 by the end of 2026. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has not changed her long-term stance. ARK maintains a 2030 bull-case target of $1.5 million for Bitcoin, while its bear-case estimate stands at $300,000. Wood cited expanding liquidity and capital returning to markets as supportive forces. She also noted shifting dynamics between Bitcoin, stablecoins, and gold. Does long-term conviction outweigh near-term turbulence? Michael Saylor’s Strategy Michael Saylor’s Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, illustrates the risks tied to corporate Bitcoin accumulation. The company reported a $17.44 billion unrealized loss in the fourth quarter of 2025 after Bitcoin fell 25% during the period. Strategy now marks Bitcoin holdings to fair value, which directly links earnings to price swings. Despite volatility, Strategy continued buying Bitcoin, adding over $116 million in early January. The firm holds more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply , yet its stock trades below the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Investors now focus on liquidity management, debt servicing, and Bitcoin’s price path in 2026. Adding to his predictions, he states that BTC will surge to $180,000 and a crash retracement to $140,000 in the near future in 2026, and could hit a $1,000,000 mark over the next 4-8 years Academic and Institutional Forecasts Narrow the Range Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex, expects Bitcoin to trade between $75,000 and $150,000 in 2026, with an average near $110,000. She attributes this range to the transition from retail-driven cycles to institutionally distributed liquidity. Institutional participation, she noted, tends to smooth extremes while maintaining volatility CoinShares research head James Butterfill projects a narrower range between $120,000 and $170,000. He pointed to a potential dovish shift at the Federal Reserve after the May leadership transition as a key variable. Butterfill also highlighted pending U.S. digital asset legislation as a possible catalyst. Regulatory clarity could change risk pricing quickly, he said. Banks See Consolidation Before ETF-Led Growth Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin at $150,000 in 2026, cutting its prior $300,000 estimate. The bank expects reduced buying from digital asset treasury companies, citing valuation constraints. Instead, it sees Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as the primary source of future demand. ETF inflows, according to the bank, may replace corporate accumulation as the dominant support mechanism. This shift could reshape Bitcoin’s market structure. Will ETFs provide enough momentum on their own? As 2026 unfolds, Bitcoin’s wide-ranging forecasts reflect uncertainty rather than consensus. Price expectations span extremes, yet most analysts cluster around a six-figure outlook. For now, Bitcoin continues to consolidate, leaving markets watching closely for the next decisive move.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-the-bull-run-is-not-over-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Periods of market hesitation often trigger loud calls that a cycle has ended. Price slows, sentiment cools, and attention drifts elsewhere. Yet history shows that these quieter phases frequently mark transition points rather than conclusions. Beneath the surface, capital positioning and institutional behavior often tell a very different story. Crypto commentator Ripple Bull Winkle recently pushed back against growing bearish narratives, arguing that the broader crypto bull market—and XRP’s role within it—remains intact. He pointed to concrete institutional actions as evidence that smart money is still positioning, even as retail confidence wavers. Institutional Filings Speak Louder Than Sentiment Ripple Bull Winkle highlighted Morgan Stanley’s recent move to file paperwork for a Bitcoin trust with U.S. regulators. He stressed that this development reflects commitment, not speculation. As he put it, “They got the paperwork ready. Not vibes, not rumors, just real filings with the SEC.” THE BULLRUN IS NOT OVER #XRP !! pic.twitter.com/LaLgDjBV2u — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) January 7, 2026 Morgan Stanley , a financial institution managing roughly $1.6 trillion in assets, does not make regulatory filings casually. Such actions require legal preparation, internal approvals, and long-term strategic intent. Ripple Bull Winkle emphasized that institutions rarely enter markets impulsively or at euphoric peaks. Why Timing Matters in Market Cycles According to Ripple Bull Winkle, institutional timing offers critical insight into where the market stands in the cycle. He noted that “institutions don’t file S-1s at the top.” Instead, they tend to act when retail investors feel fatigued, distracted, or fearful. These conditions often emerge during consolidation phases, not during final blow-off tops. This behavior aligns with past market cycles, where major capital deployments occurred during periods of uncertainty rather than optimism. The current environment, marked by selective pessimism and reduced excitement, fits that historical pattern. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for XRP and the Broader Market Although Morgan Stanley’s filing centers on Bitcoin, its implications extend beyond a single asset. Institutional engagement in crypto infrastructure reinforces confidence in the asset class as a whole. XRP, with its focus on payments , liquidity, and regulated financial integration, stands to benefit from continued institutional validation across the sector. Ripple Bull Winkle framed the current phase as one of market preparation rather than exhaustion. He described it as “the part where the weak hands get shaken out right before the violent moves.” In this view, volatility and boredom serve a purpose by redistributing assets toward longer-term holders. Watching Capital, Not Noise Ripple Bull Winkle urged investors to focus on capital flows rather than headlines, concluding simply: “Watch the money. Ignore the noise.” His message underscores a recurring theme in market history—when institutions move quietly, cycles often still have room to run. For XRP holders, these signals suggest patience may matter more than short-term sentiment. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Nexo announced the launch of Zero-interest Credit (ZiC) on Thursday, a new borrowing product that charges zero percent interest and zero fees. What makes this different? Borrowers know exactly when they need to repay from day one, and the loan cannot be liquidated mid-term if markets drop. For long-term crypto holders tired of watching their collateral at risk, this removes a major headache. The problem Nexo is solving Crypto lending used to be simple: you deposit Bitcoin or Ethereum, they lend you stablecoins, and you pay interest each month. But there was always an asterisk. Markets drop, your collateral loses value, and the lender can force you to repay or face liquidation. For traders and investors, this uncertainty was painful. Nexo’s new Zero-interest Credit flips the script. Instead of a rolling line of credit with interest charges, this is a fixed-term loan. You pick how long you need the money, and both sides know upfront whether you will repay in cash or collateral, depending on where crypto prices stand when maturity hits. The loan cannot be forcibly liquidated during the term. Simplicity in a complex market A Bitcoin HODLer (someone holding for the long term) can now borrow $50,000 without selling their BTC, avoiding a taxable event entirely. A trader pursuing a market opportunity can access capital with defined risk. A business using crypto reserves can finance operations without unwinding positions. According to Nexo, this product has quietly been available to private clients for a while. In 2025 alone, it unlocked more than $140 million in liquidity for those customers. Now the company is opening it up to everyone on the platform. Timing hits a boom market The launch comes as crypto-backed lending is on fire. In the third quarter of 2025, total crypto-collateralized lending reached $73.59 billion, a new all-time record and 38.5% growth quarter-over-quarter. This surpassed the previous peak from 2021, signaling that institutional money is flooding into crypto borrowing. The key difference from 2021: most of these loans today are fully collateralized and transparent. The wilder, riskier era of uncollateralized lending is gone.​ Nexo’s new product reflects this shift. As Elitsa Taskova, the company’s Chief Product Officer, said in the announcement: Borrowers today want liquidity that is cost-efficient, clear, and free from the uncertainty of liquidation risk.​ “Zero-interest Credit gives them exactly that—a fully predefined borrowing structure they can rely on from start to finish,” Taskova added. What this means for the broader industry Nexo is betting that predictability beats low rates. In traditional crypto lending, some platforms advertise 0.5% monthly interest, but that compounds and creates hidden risk. Zero-interest Credit offers clarity instead: no surprises, no creeping costs, no liquidation drama. The move also underscores how crypto lending is maturing. Centralized platforms like Nexo are competing not on who can offer the cheapest rate, but on who can offer the safest, most transparent product. With $11 billion in assets under management and presence in 150+ jurisdictions, Nexo is using this new product to defend its position against both DeFi platforms and other centralized lenders.

Reports say that they all got more than 3,400 downloads before they were taken down from the npm registry. The packages, which include bitcoin-main-lib, bitcoin-lib-js, and bip40, had amassed 2,300, 193, and 970 downloads. By copying names and details from real Bitcoin components, the attacker made these lookalike modules appear harmless at a glance. “The bitcoin-main-lib and bitcoin-lib-js packages execute a postinstall.cjs script during installation, which installs bip40, the package that contains the malicious payload,” Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Satyam Singh and Lakhan Parashar said. “This final payload, named NodeCordRAT by ThreatLabz, is a remote access trojan (RAT) with data-stealing capabilities.” NodeCordRAT is equipped to steal Google Chrome credentials Zscaler ThreatLabz analysts identified the trio in Nov while scanning the npm registry for suspicious packages and strange download patterns. NodeCordRAT represents a new malware family that leverages Discord servers for command-and-control (C2) communication. NodeCordRAT was built to steal Google Chrome login information, API codes kept in.env files, and MetaMask wallet data like private keys and seed phrases. The person who posted all three malicious packages used the email address supertalented730@gmail.com. The attack chain begins when developers unknowingly install bitcoin-main-lib or bitcoin-lib-js from npm. Then it identifies the path of the bip40 package and starts it in detached mode using PM2. The attack flow. Source: Zscaler ThreatLabz The malware generates a unique identifier for compromised machines using the format platform-uuid, such as win32-c5a3f1b4. It achieves this by extracting system UUIDs through commands like wmic csproduct get UUID on Windows or reading /etc/machine-id on Linux systems. Malicious node packages that caused crypto thefts Trust Wallet said that the theft of almost $8.5 million was connected to an attack on the npm ecosystem supply chain by “Sha1-Hulud NPM.” More than 2,500 wallets were affected. Hackers used a hacked npm as NodeCordRAT-style trojans and supply chain malware. It was incorporated into client-side code that stole money from customers when they accessed their wallets. Other 2025 examples that fall into two buckets that resemble the NodeCordRAT style threat include the Force Bridge exploit, which occurred between May and June 2025. Attackers stole either the software or the private keys that validator nodes used to authorize cross-chain withdrawals. This turned nodes into malicious actors that could approve fraudulent transactions. This breach resulted in an estimated $3.6 million in stolen assets, including ETH, USDC, USDT, and other tokens. It also forced the bridge to stop operations and conduct audits. In September, the Shibarium Bridge exploit unfolded, and attackers were able to take control of most of the validator power for a short time. As revealed by Cryptopolitan, this let them serve as bad validator nodes, sign off on illegal withdrawals, and take around $2.8 million in SHIB, ETH, and BONE tokens. Don’t just read crypto news.

This subtle yet significant shift, recorded at approximately 8:05 a.m. UTC, provides a momentary respite for the global network of miners securing the world’s premier cryptocurrency. According to data from blockchain analytics provider Cloverpool, this adjustment reflects the dynamic equilibrium at the heart of Bitcoin’s decentralized protocol. Understanding the Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Adjustment The Bitcoin mining difficulty is a self-correcting mechanism embedded in the protocol. It ensures new blocks are added to the blockchain roughly every ten minutes, regardless of the total computational power, or hashrate, dedicated to the network. The system reviews conditions every 2,016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks. Consequently, it recalibrates the difficulty of the cryptographic puzzle miners must solve. If more miners join the network and the average block time falls below ten minutes, the difficulty increases. Conversely, if hashrate drops and block times lengthen, the difficulty decreases to maintain the target pace. This latest 1.20% drop to 146.47 T indicates a slight reduction in the overall competing hashrate since the previous adjustment period. The Data Behind the Adjustment Cloverpool’s data reveals critical metrics surrounding this event. The network’s seven-day average hashrate at the adjustment moment was 1.04 zettahashes per second (ZH/s). For context, one zettahash represents one sextillion hash calculations per second. The current live hashrate sits slightly higher at 1.06 ZH/s, suggesting a minor recovery in network participation post-adjustment. The next difficulty recalibration is projected in about 14 days, continuing the perpetual cycle of network tuning. This dynamic directly impacts miner economics, as a lower difficulty reduces the energy and computational effort required to find a valid block, potentially improving profit margins for efficient operations. Contextualizing the Hashrate and Market Dynamics Network hashrate serves as the ultimate health indicator for Bitcoin’s security. The current figure of 1.06 ZH/s represents an immense global investment in specialized hardware and energy. Historically, hashrate trends correlate with Bitcoin’s price, miner profitability, and broader macroeconomic factors like energy costs and regulatory landscapes. A declining difficulty often follows periods where marginal miners become unprofitable and temporarily shut down their machines, a process known as miner capitulation. However, a single 1.20% move is relatively modest. It typically signals a routine rebalancing rather than a major network stress event. For comparison, the all-time high difficulty reached approximately 150 T in late 2024, making the current 146.47 T a slight step back from that peak. Recent Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustments Date Difficulty (T) Change 7-Day Avg. Hashrate (ZH/s) Dec 2024 ~148.2 +0.50% ~1.05 Jan 8, 2025 146.47 -1.20% 1.04 Several real-world factors can influence these metrics. Seasonal changes in renewable energy availability, geopolitical events affecting energy markets, and the cyclical release of new, more efficient mining hardware all play a role. Furthermore, the recent approval and launch of several U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has altered capital flows and institutional interest, indirectly affecting miner sentiment and investment strategies. Analysts monitor these adjustments closely for signals about network security and miner health. Expert Analysis on Miner Profitability Industry experts emphasize that difficulty adjustments are a double-edged sword. A decrease lowers the operational bar for existing miners, allowing them to earn more Bitcoin per unit of energy consumed. This can stabilize mining operations during periods of low Bitcoin prices or high energy costs. However, it may also indicate that some miners have been forced offline, slightly reducing the network’s decentralized distribution. The immediate impact is a marginal improvement in profitability for the remaining miners. Key metrics to watch following such an adjustment include: Hash Price: The expected daily revenue per unit of hashrate. Network Distribution: Changes in the geographic concentration of mining power. Transaction Fee Revenue: The proportion of miner income from fees versus block rewards. This automated system ensures Bitcoin’s monetary policy remains predictable and its security robust, without requiring any central authority to intervene. The Road Ahead: Next Adjustment and Long-Term Trends The protocol has already scheduled the next difficulty adjustment for roughly January 22, 2025. The direction and magnitude of that change will depend entirely on the average hashrate sustained over the coming 2,016-block period. If the current hashrate of 1.06 ZH/s holds or increases, the next adjustment will likely be positive, pushing difficulty back upward. This constant oscillation around the ten-minute block time target is a feature, not a bug, demonstrating the network’s resilience. Long-term, the trajectory of mining difficulty is a powerful narrative of technological adoption and innovation. The relentless climb over Bitcoin’s history, punctuated by periodic downward adjustments, charts the journey from hobbyist CPUs to global industrial-scale operations. Looking forward, several developments could influence future cycles. The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, which reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, permanently altered miner revenue structures. Furthermore, advancements in energy-efficient ASIC chips and the growing integration of flare gas and stranded renewable energy continue to reshape the mining landscape. Each difficulty adjustment, therefore, is a snapshot of a complex, global industry adapting in real-time. Conclusion The January 8th Bitcoin mining difficulty drop of 1.20% to 146.47 T is a routine yet vital function of the network’s consensus mechanism. It highlights the self-regulating nature of the Bitcoin protocol, ensuring stability and security regardless of fluctuating participation levels. While offering temporary relief to active miners, this adjustment also provides analysts with data points to assess the health and economic pressures within the mining sector. As the network progresses toward its next recalculation, the world will watch how this foundational metric responds to evolving market conditions and technological progress, reaffirming Bitcoin’s robust and decentralized design. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin mining difficulty mean? A1: Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a hash below a given target. The network adjusts it every 2,016 blocks to ensure a consistent block time of about ten minutes, maintaining a predictable issuance schedule for new bitcoins. Q2: Why did the difficulty drop on January 8, 2025? A2: The difficulty dropped by 1.20% because the average time to mine blocks in the previous period was slightly longer than ten minutes. This indicated that the total computational power (hashrate) on the network had decreased, so the protocol made mining easier to return to the target block time. Q3: How does a lower difficulty affect Bitcoin miners? A3: A lower Bitcoin mining difficulty means miners can solve blocks with less computational effort. This typically increases profitability for active miners, as they can potentially earn the same block reward while expending less electricity per hash calculated. Q4: What is the relationship between hashrate and difficulty? A4: Hashrate and difficulty have a direct, inverse relationship in the adjustment mechanism. A sustained increase in hashrate leads to a higher difficulty; a sustained decrease leads to a lower difficulty. The system uses this feedback loop to stabilize block production. Q5: How often does Bitcoin’s mining difficulty change? A5: The Bitcoin network is designed to reassess and adjust its mining difficulty approximately every two weeks, or after every 2,016 blocks are mined. The exact timing depends on the actual speed of block discovery during that period.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $90,428 (-2.50%) in the latest print, while Ethereum is trading at $3,100 (-4.54%) . Spot ETF Flows Stabilize After Late-2025 De-Risking The bank’s read lines up with tape-level evidence that flow is now two-way , not one-way. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs printed $697.25 million in net inflows on Jan. 5 , then flipped to $243 million in net outflows on Jan. 7 . That pattern matters because it replaces “forced reduction” with “tactical rotation,” which historically tightens intraday ranges and improves bid support in BTC perp funding regimes. JPMorgan’s framework also matches prior positioning commentary from Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou’s team, which separated October perp deleveraging from November ETF-led selling by non-crypto investors, mostly retail ETF users . That distinction keeps the correction narrative anchored in positioning rather than a broken market plumbing story. Outside the ETF channel, traditional allocators received a separate “risk-off relief” input this week when MSCI said it will not remove digital-asset treasury companies (DATCO) from indexes for now , while it runs a broader review. Shares of Strategy’s (MSTR) traded higher after the update, reducing near-term forced-selling risk for passive index products that hold crypto-proxy equities. MSCI confirmed Digital Asset Treasury Companies will remain in MSCI Indexes for the Feb 2026 review. A strong outcome for neutral indexing and economic reality. Thank you to our investors and the $BTC community. — Strategy (@Strategy) January 6, 2026 Why Two-Way Flows Are Changing the Trade Setup The trade here is less about a single JPMorgan call and more about flow regime change : late 2025 looked like an unwind where ETF redemptions and perp deleveraging reinforced each other, while early January has shown creation days and redemption days alternating , which desks can hedge more cleanly via basis and options. If MSCI keeps the “DATCO” bucket in benchmarks through the February review window, systematic equity reallocations stop acting like a hidden sell program for crypto beta, which supports tighter correlations among BTC spot, CME basis, and listed ETF flow momentum into month-end rebalancing.

The most recent bill, introduced at the close of December, looks more like a restart than a follow-up, removing ambition but increasing the regulations around what the state can have, in fact. Florida Pushes Bitcoin-Only Approach in State Crypto Reserve Plan Senate Bill 1038 is sponsored by Republican Senator Joe Gruters and was submitted on Dec. 30, 2025, and officially registered in committee review on Jan. 7, 2026. Legislative records show the bill has been referred to the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee, the Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government, and the Appropriations Committee. It must clear those hearings before advancing to the Senate floor, and if adopted alongside related legislation, the measure would take effect on July 1, 2026. The proposal would authorize the creation of a Florida Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve to be administered by the state’s Chief Financial Officer. Under the bill, the CFO would be permitted to purchase, hold, manage, exchange, and liquidate cryptocurrency using standards similar to those applied to public trust assets. While the legislation avoids naming specific tokens, it sets a strict eligibility rule: any cryptocurrency acquired must have maintained an average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over the previous 24 months. That requirement effectively limits the reserve to Bitcoin and marks a sharp contrast with Florida’s earlier attempts. Crypto Reserve Plan Gets a Reset in Florida’s 2026 Legislative Session During the 2025 legislative session, House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 sought to establish a broader framework for digital asset reserves but were indefinitely postponed and ultimately withdrawn. Those bills did not advance out of committee , ending the effort entirely rather than trimming it back. The 2026 proposals, including SB 1038 and related measures such as SB 1040, restart the process with new bill numbers and tighter guardrails. Florida has become the latest US state to abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dealing another setback. #Bitcoin #Reserve https://t.co/kRZo2V0BzE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 6, 2025 The bill lays out detailed rules for custody, oversight, and reporting as it defines key concepts such as forks, private keys, and qualified custodians. It requires the use of secure custody systems with encryption, geographic redundancy, multiparty authorization, and regular security audits. The CFO would be allowed to contract with regulated third parties, including auditors, liquidity providers, and custody technology firms, and could also use approved derivative instruments if deemed beneficial to the reserve. Spending from the reserve would be limited to authorized investments, temporary cash management, and reasonable administrative costs. If required by law or ordered by the governor, the CFO could liquidate assets and temporarily transfer funds to the state treasury, with the expectation that those funds and any earned interest would be returned to the reserve. An advisory committee would also be formed, chaired by the CFO and supported by four appointed experts in cryptocurrency investment and digital asset security. Bitcoin Reserves Gain Traction Across U.S. States Beginning at the end of 2026, the CFO would be required to submit a biennial report to the legislature detailing holdings, valuation changes, and management actions. Florida’s renewed push comes as several U.S. states experiment with Bitcoin reserve strategies. New Hampshire became the first to pass such a law , allowing investments in digital assets with market capitalizations above $500 billion. Texas has taken a donation-based approach, operating its reserve through a dedicated fund rather than direct state buying.

Oklahoma and Utah have advanced their bills, while Pennsylvania’s effort stalled.

This pivotal ruling, issued in Seoul on December 11, 2024, establishes a critical legal precedent, classifying such assets as ‘electronic certificates with economic value’ and affirming their status as seizable property for law enforcement agencies. Bitcoin Confiscation Ruling: The Case and Legal Rationale The Supreme Court dismissed an appeal from an individual, identified only as ‘A’, who challenged the seizure of their Bitcoin by investigative authorities. Consequently, the court upheld a lower court’s decision, finding the confiscation entirely lawful. The ruling specifically applies to Bitcoin held in accounts on registered exchanges like Upbit. Moreover, the court anchored its decision in the Criminal Procedure Act , determining these digital assets meet the necessary criteria for seizure. This legal classification as an ‘electronic certificate’ provides a clear, statutory basis for future actions. Therefore, prosecutors now possess a powerful tool for asset recovery in financial crime cases. Context and Evolution of South Korea’s Cryptocurrency Regulation This ruling does not emerge in a vacuum. Instead, it represents the latest development in South Korea’s meticulous approach to cryptocurrency governance. For context, the nation implemented the Travel Rule in 2021, mandating exchanges to collect and share sender and recipient data. Subsequently, the Digital Asset Basic Act is currently under legislative review, aiming to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) actively supervises exchanges, requiring strict real-name account verification. This regulatory trajectory demonstrates a consistent state effort to integrate digital assets into the formal financial and legal system. The Supreme Court’s decision solidifies this integration from a judicial standpoint. Expert Analysis: Implications for Investors and Exchanges Legal experts highlight several immediate consequences. First, the ruling erodes the perceived anonymity of exchange-held funds, strengthening the hand of regulators. Second, it creates a clear protocol for law enforcement, potentially accelerating investigations into crypto-related fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. For exchanges, the decision reinforces their role as regulated financial intermediaries, responsible for complying with seizure orders. For investors, it underscores the importance of understanding the legal status of their holdings. Assets on centralized platforms are unequivocally within the reach of judicial authority, unlike non-custodial wallets, which present more complex legal challenges. Comparative International Perspectives on Digital Asset Seizure South Korea’s approach now aligns more closely with several other jurisdictions. For example, the United States has long utilized existing laws to seize cryptocurrency from exchanges in criminal cases. Similarly, the United Kingdom applies its proceeds of crime legislation to digital assets. However, the explicit Supreme Court ruling provides exceptional clarity. Contrastingly, some jurisdictions still grapple with defining crypto as property. The table below illustrates key differences: Jurisdiction Legal Status for Confiscation Key Legislation/Precedent South Korea Electronic Certificate (Property) Supreme Court Ruling (Dec 2024), Criminal Procedure Act United States Property / Commodity Case law (e.g., SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.), CFTC/SEC guidance European Union Property (varies by member state) Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation Japan Legal Property Payment Services Act (PSA) Amendments This global trend indicates a move toward formal recognition and state control over exchange-traded crypto assets. Practical Impact and Future Enforcement Scenarios The ruling’s practical impact will be significant. Investigative agencies can now proceed with greater confidence in cases involving: Fraud and Scam Proceeds: Seizing Bitcoin acquired through phishing or Ponzi schemes. Drug Trafficking and Darknet Markets: Confiscating crypto used for illegal purchases. Tax Evasion: Freezing assets to secure unpaid taxes on crypto gains. Embezzlement and Bribery: Recovering digital assets used as bribes or stolen funds. Furthermore, the process will likely involve formal requests to exchanges, which are legally obligated to comply. This creates a streamlined path from investigation to asset recovery, closing a previously ambiguous loophole. The Road Ahead: Legislation and Market Reaction This judicial precedent will undoubtedly influence pending legislation, such as the Digital Asset Basic Act. Lawmakers may incorporate the ‘electronic certificate’ definition directly into statute. Market reaction has been measured, with analysts noting the ruling primarily affects illicit activity, not legitimate investors. However, it reinforces the necessity of using compliant, regulated exchanges. The long-term effect could be increased institutional confidence, as legal clarity reduces systemic risk. Conversely, it may push some activity toward decentralized platforms, presenting a new regulatory frontier. Conclusion The South Korean Supreme Court’s ruling on Bitcoin confiscation marks a decisive moment in the maturation of cryptocurrency law. By definitively classifying exchange-held Bitcoin as a seizable electronic certificate, the court has provided crucial legal certainty. This decision strengthens regulatory enforcement, protects the financial system, and aligns South Korea with global best practices. Ultimately, it underscores a fundamental reality: within regulated exchanges, digital assets are subject to the full authority of the state, a principle now firmly embedded in Korean jurisprudence. FAQs Q1: What exactly did the South Korean Supreme Court rule? The court ruled that Bitcoin held in accounts on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges qualifies as an ‘electronic certificate with economic value’ and can be legally confiscated by authorities under the Criminal Procedure Act. Q2: Does this mean all my Bitcoin can be seized? No. The ruling specifically applies to Bitcoin held on centralized, regulated exchanges like Upbit. It does not directly address Bitcoin in private, non-custodial wallets, though other laws may apply. Q3: Why is this ruling significant for the cryptocurrency industry? It provides critical legal clarity, confirming that digital assets on exchanges are recognized as property subject to state authority. This reduces regulatory ambiguity for businesses and investors. Q4: How does this affect ordinary, law-abiding cryptocurrency investors? For investors using licensed exchanges and complying with laws, there is no direct impact. The ruling is a tool for combating crime, not targeting legitimate activity. Q5: Could this precedent be applied to other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin? Yes, the legal logic classifying Bitcoin as an ‘electronic certificate with economic value’ would very likely extend to other cryptocurrencies with similar characteristics held on exchanges.

This legal confrontation, unfolding in San Francisco federal court, represents one of the most significant corporate governance battles in technology history, potentially reshaping how AI companies balance ethical commitments with commercial realities. Elon Musk’s OpenAI Lawsuit Advances to March Trial U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers announced on Monday that sufficient evidence exists to support Elon Musk’s allegations against OpenAI and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. The judge specifically noted evidence suggesting OpenAI leaders made repeated assurances about maintaining their original nonprofit structure. Consequently, she tentatively scheduled a jury trial for March 2025, rejecting OpenAI’s motion for dismissal. Musk filed his lawsuit in 2024, alleging that OpenAI violated contractual agreements by transitioning toward profit-seeking activities rather than adhering to its founding mission of developing artificial intelligence “for the benefit of humanity.” The Tesla and SpaceX CEO contends he invested approximately $38 million in early funding based on these assurances, along with providing crucial guidance and credibility during OpenAI’s formative years. An OpenAI spokesperson responded to Bitcoin World with a statement calling Musk’s lawsuit “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.” The organization maintains that its structural evolution represents necessary adaptations to secure funding for large-scale AI development while maintaining ethical guardrails through its unique governance model. The Complex History Behind OpenAI’s Structural Evolution OpenAI began in 2015 as a pure nonprofit research laboratory with an ambitious mission: to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. Elon Musk co-founded the organization alongside Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman. The founding team explicitly rejected traditional corporate structures, believing profit motives could compromise AI safety research. However, by 2018, significant tensions emerged within OpenAI’s leadership. Musk reportedly sought to assume the CEO position but faced rejection from other co-founders, who instead elevated Sam Altman to the role. Musk subsequently resigned from OpenAI’s board, citing potential conflicts with Tesla’s autonomous vehicle development. Despite his departure, he remained a vocal advocate for the organization’s original nonprofit principles. In 2019, OpenAI introduced its first major structural change by creating a “capped-profit” subsidiary. This innovative model limited investor returns while enabling the organization to raise substantial capital from Microsoft and other backers. The company argued this hybrid approach balanced ethical commitments with practical funding needs for expensive AI research and talent acquisition. OpenAI Structural Timeline Year Development Key Details 2015 Nonprofit Founding Elon Musk among co-founders with $1 billion pledge 2018 Musk’s Departure Resigned after CEO bid rejected; cited Tesla conflicts 2019 Capped-Profit Model Created subsidiary with limited investor returns 2024 Musk Files Lawsuit Alleges breach of nonprofit commitments 2025 Formal Restructuring Public Benefit Corporation with nonprofit equity stake Legal Experts Weigh In on Contractual Implications Legal analysts following the case note several precedent-setting aspects. Professor Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School explains, “This case raises fundamental questions about whether mission statements and founding principles constitute binding commitments when organizations attract funding and talent based on those promises.” He adds that the outcome could establish new standards for technology governance. Corporate law specialists highlight the unusual nature of Musk’s claims regarding “ill-gotten gains.” Typically, nonprofit founders cannot claim damages from organizational restructuring unless specific contractual guarantees exist. However, Judge Gonzalez Rogers’ finding of evidence suggests Musk may have documented assurances about OpenAI’s permanent nonprofit status. The trial’s timing coincides with increasing regulatory scrutiny of AI companies globally. European Union officials recently finalized comprehensive AI legislation, while U.S. lawmakers continue debating appropriate oversight frameworks. This legal battle therefore occurs within a broader policy context examining how to ensure AI development aligns with public interest. OpenAI’s 2025 Restructuring and Musk’s Acquisition Bid Despite Musk’s legal challenges, OpenAI completed its formal corporate restructuring in October 2025. The organization transformed its for-profit branch into a Public Benefit Corporation, while the original nonprofit entity retained a 26% equity stake. This structure theoretically allows profit generation while maintaining mission-aligned governance through the nonprofit’s controlling interest. OpenAI leadership argues this model represents the optimal balance between ethical commitments and practical necessities. “Developing advanced AI systems requires unprecedented computational resources and specialized talent,” explained an OpenAI spokesperson. “Our structure ensures we can compete while maintaining our founding principles through the nonprofit’s governance role.” In February 2025, Musk made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI, which Sam Altman promptly rejected. This extraordinary offer, nearly triple OpenAI’s estimated valuation at the time, demonstrated Musk’s continued interest in shaping the organization’s direction. Industry observers interpreted the bid as both a genuine acquisition attempt and a strategic move to strengthen his legal position. Since leaving OpenAI, Musk launched his own artificial intelligence venture, xAI, in 2023. The company develops AI systems with explicit safety frameworks and has positioned itself as a more transparent alternative to established players. xAI’s Grok chatbot directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, creating commercial tensions that further complicate the legal proceedings. The Broader Impact on AI Industry Governance This lawsuit arrives during a pivotal moment for artificial intelligence development. Several key trends intersect with the legal proceedings: Increasing Capital Requirements: Advanced AI models now require billions in computational investment, creating pressure for commercial structures Talent Competition: Top AI researchers command compensation packages exceeding traditional nonprofit capabilities Regulatory Evolution: Governments worldwide are developing AI governance frameworks that may influence corporate structures Public Trust Concerns: Surveys show declining public confidence in AI companies’ ability to self-regulate Technology ethicists emphasize that the trial’s outcome could establish important precedents. Dr. Alondra Nelson, former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, notes, “How we structure AI organizations fundamentally influences what values get embedded in their systems. This case tests whether founding principles can survive commercial pressures.” What the March 2025 Trial Will Determine The jury trial scheduled for March 2025 will focus on several critical questions. First, jurors must determine whether OpenAI leadership made binding promises about maintaining nonprofit status. Second, they will evaluate whether the organization’s structural changes violated those commitments. Finally, they must decide appropriate remedies if breaches occurred, including potential monetary damages. Legal documents reveal Musk seeks compensation for what he describes as “ill-gotten gains” resulting from OpenAI’s transition. His legal team argues the organization’s increased valuation directly resulted from abandoning its nonprofit constraints, thereby enriching founders and investors at the expense of the original mission. OpenAI’s defense centers on several key arguments. The organization maintains that structural evolution represented necessary adaptation rather than mission abandonment. Leadership contends that without commercial capabilities, OpenAI could not have developed ChatGPT or competed with well-funded rivals like Google and Meta. They further argue that their Public Benefit Corporation structure maintains ethical oversight through the nonprofit’s equity stake and governance rights. Industry observers note the trial’s timing creates additional complexities. By March 2025, OpenAI will have operated under its new structure for several months, potentially establishing precedent about its practical implementation. Meanwhile, Musk’s xAI will have further developed its competitive position, possibly influencing perceptions of his motivations. Conclusion The Elon Musk OpenAI lawsuit proceeding to jury trial in March 2025 represents a watershed moment for artificial intelligence governance. This legal confrontation tests whether technology organizations can evolve structurally while honoring founding ethical commitments. Regardless of the verdict, the trial will likely influence how future AI ventures structure themselves and attract funding. The outcome may establish important precedents about balancing innovation with responsibility during this transformative technological era. As AI continues reshaping society, this case highlights the complex interplay between visionary ideals, practical necessities, and legal accountability in frontier technology development. FAQs Q1: What are the main allegations in Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI? Elon Musk alleges that OpenAI and its co-founders breached contractual agreements by transitioning from a pure nonprofit to a for-profit structure, thereby abandoning their founding mission to develop AI “for the benefit of humanity.” He claims he invested $38 million based on assurances about permanent nonprofit status. Q2: Why did the judge allow the case to proceed to trial? U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found sufficient evidence suggesting OpenAI leaders made assurances about maintaining nonprofit structure. She determined a jury should evaluate whether these constituted binding commitments and whether OpenAI’s structural changes violated them. Q3: How has OpenAI responded to the lawsuit? OpenAI calls the lawsuit “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.” The organization maintains its structural evolution was necessary to secure funding for large-scale AI development while maintaining ethical oversight through its unique Public Benefit Corporation model. Q4: What is OpenAI’s current corporate structure? As of October 2025, OpenAI operates as a Public Benefit Corporation with the original nonprofit entity retaining a 26% equity stake. This hybrid model allows profit generation while theoretically maintaining mission alignment through the nonprofit’s governance role. Q5: How might this lawsuit affect the broader AI industry? The trial could establish important precedents about whether founding principles constitute binding commitments when organizations attract funding and talent. The outcome may influence how future AI ventures structure themselves and balance ethical commitments with commercial realities.

BKKT's transformation into a pure-play digital asset infrastructure business is promising, but execution risk should not be underestimated. Loss of Webull, which accounted for 74% of revenue, and loyalty business exit have improved revenue quality. A lot has changed since my latest coverage of Bakkt Holdings, Inc. ( BKKT ) almost two years ago in February 2024, when I rated the stock a buy. A noticeable change would be the reverse stock split taking place just a few months after my coverage, making BKKT trade at around $38 per share post-split, as opposed to $1.54 per share. This means my 1-year target price of $12 would also adjust to $292 per share, proving my call wrong. Across the rest of 2024 and 2025, I would categorize BKKT’s share performance as highly volatile. It appears that the potential macro catalyst I highlighted in my earlier coverage, while it did have a positive effect on BKKT's share price, was not enough to help BKKT reach my target price. The catalyst I highlighted was a potential bitcoin bull run post-halving that could drive BKKT’s share performance that I predicted to happen sometime towards the end of 2024, consistent with the earlier patterns, such as in 2016 and 2020. While it was true that bitcoin reached a temporary all-time high in December 2024 and positively drove BKKT’s share price, share price was already down so much post-split throughout 2024 to around low teens on average, making it an uphill battle for BAKKT. I re-rated BKKT to neutral. At the current price level, BKKT appears fully valued despite the improving fundamentals and compelling growth story into 2026. Financials From a financial perspective, the major changes that have taken place since my last coverage would include the revenue omission from loyalty business, which was sold for $11 million in 2025. However, the most major change as per today would be the termination of commercial relationship with Webull in mid of 2025, which drove almost 74% of BKKT’s revenue. In my view, while BKKT’s financials have been significantly impacted by these two events, the longer-term impact should be relatively positive. First off, the revenue concentration issue should no longer be a point of concern going forward. Secondly, BKKT’s loyalty exit reduces distraction in BKKT’s transformational shift towards a pure-play digital asset infrastructure business. As of Q3 2025, I would rate BKKT’s top-line performance as relatively decent and progressing. Despite losing 74% of its revenue, revenue saw a solid growth YoY in Q3. More importantly, with the revenue generation now fully driven by the crypto services business, the perceived quality of the revenue is also better YoY, in my opinion. Q3 revenue was $402 million, an over 27% YoY growth compared to $316.3 million in Q3, 2024. BKKT 10-Q Profitability-wise, BKKT has improved despite still realizing GAAP net losses, which was merely driven by an excessive non-cash charge due to the change of fair value in warrant liability. One thing to note here is that adjusted EBITDA not only turned positive but also reached a meaningful figure. In Q3, adjusted EBITDA was $28.7 million. At the same time last year, BKKT still realized an adjusted EBITDA loss of -$20.1 million. BKKT 10-Q Excluding the $37.2 million non-cash charge, lower SG&A expenses, which was down 59% YoY in Q3, has been helpful in driving improved profitability of BKKT. Furthermore, when we zoom out a bit into the last nine months, SG&A expenses have consistently declined significantly as well. In the end, BKKT seemed to have done relatively well here, suggesting that the transformation is slowly but surely working. If there were any possible areas of concern, I believe it may have been the liquidity and cash-flow generation. As of Q3, BKKT remains a cash-burning operation with high dependency on financing cash flow to sustain its business. Nonetheless, they come with asterisks too. Q3 presentation One positive note is that BKKT has been able to maintain its debt-free status as of Q3. BKKT ended Q3 with $64.4 million in cash and equivalents and with a cleaner balance sheet, after its recent elimination of the Up-C structure. BKKT also successfully raised $100 million in new funding in Q3. Another positive sign is that the main driver for the widened operating cash flow (OCF) loss in the last nine months ending Q3 was merely a one-off case, which was the over $77 million decrease in customer funds associated with the Webull trading activities. As such, OCF may continue its progress towards neutral or positive into FY 2026, supported by the stronger adjusted EBITDA in Q3. Catalyst A few things could be contributors to potential positive re-rating, in my view. In a nutshell, BKKT appears to have a compelling offering to address the demand in the growing stablecoin and bitcoin treasury strategy markets. Q3 presentation With the revenue generation of the new product simply driven by crypto and stablecoin volume, it is also simpler for investors to understand the trajectory of BKKT’s business in line with the enterprise tokenization and bitcoin treasury adoption in 2026 and beyond. RWA.xyz/stablecoins I believe the important piece to product adoption is really the growing demand. Just looking at the stablecoin growth on YoY basis, settlement volume has almost doubled from $30 trillion in 2024 to $57 trillion last year alone, suggesting there is still plenty of upside here. In addition, I also expect bitcoin treasury strategy to continue growing in popularity among public companies, driving adoption for BKKT’s institutional custody and execution services through its partnership with its parent company, ICE. Risk All in all, BKKT’s complete transformation into what it is today is still only the beginning, in my view. While some of the things we have seen look good on paper, it still requires a strong execution in an increasingly competitive market to drive market confidence. As such, despite all of the other possible risk factors, I believe the execution lag with its new product could be a major risk factor that could derail BKKT from having a strong 2026. The AI-powered treasury infrastructure, for instance, may struggle to achieve product-market fit, resulting in such a lag, given the competition from companies like Stripe or PayPal. Another downside driver, in my view, would be a potential crypto winter. Though my prediction in my latest coverage about halving cycles was proven inaccurate, historically, crypto markets see a drawdown in the third year post halving following a possible peak in the previous year. This suggests that 2026 could be a challenging year for crypto. Valuation/Pricing My 1-year target price for BKKT is driven by the following assumptions for the bull vs. bear scenarios, using a combination of consensus estimates and my own analysis: Bull scenario (50% probability) assumptions - BKKT achieves an infrastructure pure-play transformation, marked by its success in onboarding enterprise clients with a potential to replace its loss in revenue from Webull churn. BKKT maintains positive trends in profitability. At 0.4x P/S, multiples should see a meaningful enough expansion to reflect things I mentioned above. BKKT last saw 0.4x P/S sometimes in mid-2023, before it continued its downtrend to a relatively depressed level today. Bear scenario (50% probability) assumptions - BKKT sees an execution lag where it struggles to onboard new enterprise clients. There is also the potential crypto winter in 2026. I would expect P/S multiple to improve from today’s relatively depressed level to reflect the overall narrative of pure-play digital infrastructure transformation, yet at 0.1x, it still does not capture the successful execution of it. Own Analysis Consolidating all the information above into my model, I arrived at an FY 2026 weighted target price of $16.7 per share, suggesting around 8% from the current price level. I give the stock a neutral rating. Conclusion My view is that BKKT has transitioned from a speculative turnaround in my first coverage to some growth story that could be promising. With the stock currently trading around $15.5 per share, it seems it has been moving towards the 1-year price target earlier than expected due to over 48% surge in over the past five days. I suspect this to be a possible side effect of an uptick in the bitcoin market within the same period. While in absence of that I would overall rate the stock a buy due to interesting developments on the product side and also attractive bitcoin treasury and stablecoin market, the current neutral stance merely suggests that today is not the right time to enter BKKT, and that interested investors should continue to monitor price movements in the next few quarters.",BKKT,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

According to data analyzed by industry experts, several key indicators now point toward increasing probability of sideways movement or correction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This development comes as Bitcoin faces significant resistance levels following its recent market performance, prompting traders and analysts to closely monitor fundamental blockchain signals for directional clues. Understanding Bitcoin Consolidation Through On-Chain Metrics Market consolidation represents a period where asset prices move within a relatively narrow range, typically following significant upward or downward movements. For Bitcoin, consolidation phases often serve as crucial foundation-building periods that establish support levels for future price action. Blockchain data provides unique transparency into these market dynamics, offering insights unavailable through traditional technical analysis alone. The current signals emerging from Bitcoin’s underlying network suggest we may be approaching such a transitional period. Analysts typically monitor several key on-chain indicators to gauge market health and potential directional shifts. These metrics include exchange flows, holder behavior patterns, network activity levels, and various valuation ratios. When multiple indicators align to suggest similar market conditions, the probability of accurate prediction increases substantially. Currently, several of these metrics are flashing cautionary signals that merit careful consideration by market participants. The MVRV Ratio: A Critical Valuation Indicator The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio serves as one of the most reliable on-chain metrics for assessing Bitcoin’s valuation relative to its economic foundation. This ratio compares Bitcoin’s current market capitalization to its realized capitalization, which represents the aggregate price at which each coin last moved on-chain. When the MVRV ratio reaches elevated levels, it typically indicates that the market has entered overvalued territory relative to the average cost basis of investors. CryptoQuant analyst CrypZeno recently highlighted concerning developments in Bitcoin’s MVRV trajectory. According to their analysis, the ratio has turned downward after encountering resistance in what many consider an overvalued zone. This reversal suggests that unrealized profits across the Bitcoin network are beginning to compress, potentially signaling reduced buying pressure or increased selling activity. Historically, such MVRV behavior has often preceded consolidation phases as markets digest previous gains and establish new equilibrium levels. Historical Context of MVRV Movements Examining Bitcoin’s historical price action reveals consistent patterns around MVRV ratio movements. During the 2017 bull market peak, the MVRV ratio reached approximately 3.7 before the subsequent bear market consolidation. Similarly, the 2021 cycle saw the ratio approach 3.2 before significant correction and sideways movement. While current levels remain below these historical extremes, the directional change in the ratio provides important context for potential near-term market behavior. Furthermore, the rate of change in the MVRV ratio often proves more informative than absolute values. A rapid decline following resistance at elevated levels typically indicates accelerated profit-taking behavior among market participants. This dynamic appears to be developing currently, with on-chain data showing increased movement of older coins that were accumulated at lower price points. Long-Term Holder Behavior and Market Implications Long-term Bitcoin holders, typically defined as addresses holding coins for at least 155 days, represent a crucial segment of the market with significant influence over supply dynamics. These investors generally exhibit lower selling propensity during normal market conditions but often become active during periods of elevated valuation. Recent on-chain data suggests this cohort may be beginning to distribute portions of their holdings, contributing to the consolidation signals. The Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) metric, which tracks the age distribution of coins being moved on-chain, shows increased activity from older coin cohorts. This movement pattern often precedes consolidation phases as long-term holders realize profits and redistribute capital. While not necessarily indicative of a market top, such behavior typically correlates with reduced upward momentum and increased volatility as markets absorb this additional supply. Additionally, exchange inflow metrics from older wallets have shown gradual increases in recent weeks. These inflows represent potential selling pressure that exchanges must absorb, potentially limiting near-term price appreciation. When combined with reduced exchange outflows (indicating decreased buying pressure), these dynamics create conditions conducive to consolidation rather than continued rapid appreciation. Network Fundamentals and Their Consolidation Signals Beyond valuation metrics and holder behavior, Bitcoin’s underlying network fundamentals provide additional context for potential consolidation. The network’s hash rate, while continuing its long-term upward trajectory, has shown some stabilization in recent weeks following rapid increases earlier in the year. This stabilization in mining activity often correlates with periods of price consolidation as miner selling pressure adjusts to current market conditions. Transaction volume metrics also offer important insights. While absolute transaction counts remain healthy, the value transferred on-chain (measured in USD terms) has shown some moderation from recent peaks. This suggests that while network usage remains robust, the economic magnitude of transactions may be normalizing—another characteristic often observed during consolidation phases. The following table summarizes key on-chain metrics and their current consolidation signals: Metric Current Reading Consolidation Signal MVRV Ratio Declining from resistance Strong Long-Term Holder Activity Increasing older coin movement Moderate Exchange Net Flow Moderate inflows Moderate Network Hash Rate Growth Stabilizing Weak Transaction Value Normalizing from peaks Moderate Comparative Analysis with Previous Cycles Examining similar periods in Bitcoin’s history reveals instructive patterns. The 2019 consolidation phase, which followed a significant rally from bear market lows, exhibited comparable on-chain characteristics. During that period, the MVRV ratio similarly declined from elevated levels while long-term holders gradually distributed portions of their holdings. The resulting consolidation lasted approximately four months before the next significant directional move. More recently, the 2023 consolidation period showed similar dynamics, with MVRV resistance coinciding with increased older coin movement. That phase established crucial support levels that enabled subsequent appreciation. These historical parallels suggest that current signals, while warranting attention, represent normal market behavior within Bitcoin’s cyclical nature rather than necessarily indicating bearish reversal. Market Structure and Technical Considerations Beyond pure on-chain metrics, current market structure provides additional context for potential consolidation. Options market data shows increased interest in range-bound strategies, with traders positioning for potential sideways movement. Funding rates across perpetual swap markets have normalized from previously elevated levels, reducing the incentive for leveraged long positions that typically drive rapid appreciation. Liquidity distribution on order books also suggests potential consolidation parameters. Significant bid clusters have formed at levels approximately 15-20% below recent highs, while ask liquidity concentrates at resistance levels that have repelled multiple advance attempts. This liquidity configuration naturally encourages range-bound trading as markets test these established levels. Key technical levels to monitor during potential consolidation include: Upper resistance boundaries where previous advances have stalled Intermediate support zones established during recent pullbacks Volume profile points where significant trading activity has occurred Moving average convergences that often define consolidation ranges Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Bitcoin Consolidation While on-chain data provides crucial insights, external macroeconomic factors increasingly influence Bitcoin’s price action and potential consolidation patterns. Monetary policy developments, particularly regarding interest rate trajectories and quantitative tightening schedules, impact risk asset valuations broadly. Current expectations of prolonged elevated rates in traditional markets may contribute to consolidation dynamics in cryptocurrency markets. Institutional adoption continues progressing steadily, with recent ETF flows showing consistent accumulation despite price volatility. This institutional participation often introduces different behavioral patterns compared to retail-dominated markets, potentially contributing to more measured price action and extended consolidation periods as large positions accumulate gradually. Regulatory developments also warrant monitoring during potential consolidation phases. Clearer regulatory frameworks typically reduce uncertainty premiums that sometimes inflate valuations during speculative periods. As regulatory clarity improves in major jurisdictions, some volatility may naturally compress, supporting more stable trading ranges. Potential Duration and Characteristics of Consolidation Historical analysis suggests Bitcoin consolidation phases typically exhibit certain characteristics: Duration : Ranging from several weeks to multiple months depending on market context Volatility compression : Gradually decreasing price swings within established ranges Volume patterns : Initially elevated then normalizing as ranges establish Sentiment shifts : Transition from euphoria to uncertainty to eventual boredom On-chain stabilization : Holder behavior normalizing and metrics reaching equilibrium The current market context, with its combination of institutional participation and maturing derivatives markets, may influence consolidation characteristics compared to previous cycles. Increased market efficiency and sophistication could potentially compress consolidation duration while maintaining essential price discovery functions. Strategic Implications for Market Participants For traders and investors, potential consolidation phases present both challenges and opportunities. Range-bound markets favor different strategies than trending environments, with mean reversion approaches often outperforming breakout strategies. Options traders may find premium selling strategies particularly attractive during high implied volatility periods that often accompany consolidation initiation. Long-term investors typically view consolidation phases as accumulation opportunities, allowing dollar-cost averaging at potentially favorable levels. The reduced volatility and emotional intensity of consolidation periods often enable more disciplined investment execution compared to rapidly appreciating markets. Furthermore, consolidation frequently establishes stronger technical foundations for subsequent advances when fundamental conditions remain favorable. Conclusion Multiple on-chain indicators currently suggest increasing probability of Bitcoin consolidation in the near to medium term. The declining MVRV ratio following resistance at elevated levels, combined with increased activity from long-term holders and normalizing network metrics, creates compelling evidence for potential sideways movement. While consolidation represents a natural market phase rather than bearish reversal, it requires adjusted expectations and strategies from market participants. Monitoring these on-chain signals provides valuable insights into market structure evolution, potentially offering strategic advantages regardless of directional outcome. As always, comprehensive analysis combining on-chain data, technical factors, and macroeconomic context provides the most robust framework for navigating evolving market conditions. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Bitcoin consolidation? Bitcoin consolidation refers to a period when the cryptocurrency’s price trades within a relatively narrow range without establishing a clear upward or downward trend. This phase typically follows significant price movements and allows markets to digest previous gains or losses while establishing new support and resistance levels. Q2: How does the MVRV ratio indicate potential consolidation? The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio compares Bitcoin’s current market capitalization to the aggregate price at which all coins last moved on-chain. When this ratio declines from elevated levels after facing resistance, it suggests reduced unrealized profits and potential selling pressure, both characteristics that often precede consolidation phases. Q3: How long do Bitcoin consolidation phases typically last? Historical consolidation periods for Bitcoin have varied from several weeks to multiple months, depending on market context and preceding price action. The 2019 consolidation lasted approximately four months, while more recent phases have sometimes been shorter due to increased market efficiency and institutional participation. Q4: Does consolidation always lead to price declines? No, consolidation does not necessarily lead to price declines. While sometimes preceding corrections, consolidation phases often establish strong support levels that enable subsequent advances. The direction following consolidation depends on fundamental developments, macroeconomic conditions, and market structure evolution during the range-bound period. Q5: What should investors do during Bitcoin consolidation? During consolidation phases, investors often employ dollar-cost averaging strategies to accumulate positions at potentially favorable levels. Traders may shift to range-bound strategies rather than trend-following approaches. All market participants should monitor on-chain metrics for signs of accumulation or distribution that might indicate the consolidation phase’s eventual resolution.

According to data from the blockchain analytics firm Onchain-Lenz, BlackRock deposited 2,164 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at approximately $195.12 million, alongside 22,902 Ethereum (ETH), worth $71.43 million, to Coinbase Prime. This substantial movement, observed on the blockchain in early 2025, represents more than a simple transaction; it is a powerful signal of deepening institutional commitment to cryptocurrency infrastructure and markets. The deposit underscores a pivotal trend where traditional finance giants are actively operationalizing their crypto strategies, moving assets with precision on regulated platforms designed for heavyweight investors. Decoding the BlackRock Bitcoin Deposit to Coinbase Prime Blockchain data provides transparent, immutable evidence of this significant transfer. Onchain-Lenz, a respected provider of institutional-grade blockchain intelligence, identified and reported the movement. The funds moved from a wallet associated with BlackRock’s digital asset operations to a designated address for Coinbase Prime. For context, Coinbase Prime is not the standard retail exchange. Instead, it is a white-glove prime brokerage and custody platform built exclusively for institutional clients like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Consequently, this platform offers advanced trading tools, enhanced security protocols, and dedicated client service for executing large-scale transactions without causing major market slippage. This deposit follows a clear pattern of BlackRock’s strategic embrace of digital assets. The firm made headlines globally with the launch of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin ETF, which rapidly accumulated billions in assets under management. Therefore, this recent on-chain activity likely relates to the operational mechanics of supporting such a massive financial product. Depositing BTC to a prime brokerage like Coinbase Prime can serve several critical functions: Liquidity Provision: Facilitating the creation and redemption of ETF shares. Secure Custody: Utilizing institutional-grade cold storage solutions. Trading Readiness: Positioning assets for potential future market activities or client mandates. Moreover, the simultaneous deposit of a substantial $71 million in Ethereum highlights a diversified institutional approach. While Bitcoin is often viewed as digital gold, Ethereum’s programmable blockchain represents a bet on the future of decentralized finance and applications. The Rising Tide of Institutional Cryptocurrency Adoption BlackRock’s move is not an isolated event but a cornerstone in a broader architectural shift. Throughout 2024 and into 2025, institutional participation has evolved from cautious exploration to full-scale integration. Major banks, pension funds, and insurance companies have progressively allocated portions of their treasury portfolios to Bitcoin, citing its potential as a non-correlated asset and hedge against inflation. Regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions, particularly the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, has served as the critical catalyst, providing a familiar and regulated vehicle for traditional capital. The choice of Coinbase Prime as the destination is equally significant. The platform has emerged as the leading gateway for institutions entering the crypto space, competing directly with traditional prime brokers like Fidelity and BNY Mellon’s digital asset units. Its suite of services—including trading, custody, staking, and financing—creates a one-stop shop for complex institutional needs. When a firm of BlackRock’s stature uses such an infrastructure, it validates the entire ecosystem’s security and reliability. This validation, in turn, encourages other institutional players to follow suit, creating a virtuous cycle of adoption and investment. Expert Analysis: What This Means for Market Structure Financial analysts and blockchain researchers point to several immediate and long-term implications. Firstly, large, transparent movements from credible entities reduce market speculation and increase price stability over time. They demonstrate sophisticated asset management practices are being applied to cryptocurrencies. Secondly, this activity reinforces the importance of regulated custodians and prime brokers. As assets under management grow, the security and compliance standards of these intermediaries become paramount to the entire financial system’s integrity. Thirdly, the flow of assets into platforms like Coinbase Prime increases overall market liquidity and depth. This development makes it easier for larger trades to be executed without severe price impacts, ultimately benefiting all market participants. Finally, from a regulatory perspective, these on-chain movements are fully auditable. Regulators can monitor the flow of funds through licensed entities, which supports a more transparent and less opaque market than some traditional over-the-counter (OTC) venues. Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Dual Strategy for Institutional Portfolios The dual deposit of both Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals a nuanced institutional strategy. Analysts often describe Bitcoin as a “store of value” asset—a digital counterpart to gold, prized for its scarcity and security. Its primary investment thesis revolves around macroeconomic hedging and long-term capital preservation. Conversely, Ethereum is frequently characterized as a “productive” or “yield-generating” asset. Its blockchain supports staking, where holders can lock their ETH to help secure the network and earn rewards, similar to earning interest. This distinction is crucial for understanding institutional behavior. By holding both assets, a firm like BlackRock can pursue multiple objectives simultaneously: preserving wealth with Bitcoin while potentially generating a yield with Ethereum. The table below summarizes the core institutional perspectives on these two leading cryptocurrencies: Asset Primary Institutional Narrative Key Utility for Portfolios Bitcoin (BTC) Digital Gold / Store of Value Inflation hedge, non-correlated asset, capital preservation Ethereum (ETH) Programmable Blockchain / Yield Asset Exposure to DeFi & Web3, staking rewards, technological adoption Therefore, the nearly $200 million BTC deposit aligns with a strategic treasury allocation, while the ETH deposit may indicate preparations for staking services or exposure to the broader Ethereum ecosystem through future products. Conclusion The BlackRock Bitcoin deposit of $195 million to Coinbase Prime is a definitive milestone in the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. It transcends a mere data point on the blockchain, representing a clear vote of confidence from the world’s largest asset manager in the infrastructure built to support digital assets. This action, coupled with the simultaneous Ethereum transfer, illustrates a sophisticated, dual-asset strategy becoming standard among forward-thinking institutions. As regulatory frameworks solidify and institutional-grade tools become more robust, movements of this scale are likely to transition from headline news to routine operational activity. Ultimately, this deposit reinforces that institutional adoption is not a speculative future trend but a concrete, operational present reality, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of global finance. FAQs Q1: What is Coinbase Prime, and why did BlackRock use it? Coinbase Prime is a specialized prime brokerage platform for institutional investors. It offers secure custody, advanced trading tools, and dedicated support for large-scale transactions. BlackRock likely used it for its robust security, regulatory compliance, and ability to handle massive asset movements efficiently. Q2: Does this mean BlackRock is buying more Bitcoin? Not necessarily. This specific transaction was a deposit from a BlackRock-associated wallet to Coinbase Prime. It could represent a movement of existing holdings for operational purposes like ETF management, custody, or preparing for liquidity needs, rather than a new purchase. Q3: How does a deposit like this affect Bitcoin’s price? In the short term, a simple deposit to a custody platform may not directly impact price. However, it signals strong institutional holding patterns and reduces immediately sellable supply on open exchanges, which can be a supportive factor for long-term price stability and sentiment. Q4: What is the significance of depositing Ethereum alongside Bitcoin? It shows institutions are adopting a multi-asset strategy. While Bitcoin is seen as a store of value, Ethereum offers exposure to smart contracts and decentralized finance. Depositing both indicates a comprehensive approach to the digital asset class, covering both preservation and growth themes. Q5: Who is Onchain-Lenz, and how can we trust this data? Onchain-Lenz is a blockchain analytics and data intelligence firm that tracks on-chain transactions for institutional clients. Blockchain data is public and verifiable. Reputable analytics firms like this use clustering techniques to identify wallets belonging to major entities, providing high-confidence insights into market movements.

These numbers were driven by state-sponsored actors, including DPRK‑linked hackers, who facilitated an attack that stole $2 billion. The study described 2025 as the start of the third wave of changes in cybercrime. The first wave, which was from 2009 to 2019, was made up of malicious niche hackers. The second wave, which lasted from 2020 to 2024, saw the professionalization of illicit organizations providing on-chain infrastructure for criminal groups. Three waves of crypto crime. Source: Chainalysis Now, the third wave introduced nation-states moving into space at scale to evade international sanctions. This wave achieved a 162% increase year-over-year (YoY), which was also driven by a whopping 694% increase in the value received by sanctioned entities. However, the report states that even if the value received by sanctioned entities were flat YoY, 2025 would still mark a record year for crypto crime, as activity increased across most illicit categories. Stablecoins amassed 84% of all illicit transaction volume North Korean hackers had their most destructive year yet, stealing $2 billion in 2025 alone. The February Bybit exploit accounted for nearly $1.5 billion of that total, making it the largest crypto heist in crypto history. North Korean hackers are known to prioritize stablecoins with high liquidity and global exchange access, mainly USDT, USDC, and occasionally BUSD. Besides the North Koreans, Russia indirectly had a hand in the illicit transaction through its ruble-backed A7A5 stablecoin, which facilitated over $93.3 billion in transactions in less than a year. This drove stablecoins to take the trophy home for amassing 84% of all illicit transaction volume. On the other hand, Bitcoin has shrunk to approximately 7%. 5 years ago, these numbers were reversed; Bitcoin accounted for roughly 70% of illicit transactions, while stablecoins accounted for just 15%. Crypto assets stolen over the years. Source: Chainalysis According to Chainalysis, this shift is due to stablecoins’ practical advantages, including ease of cross-border transfers, lower volatility, and broader utility. Led by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, the total market value of dollar-pegged tokens has climbed to about $317.8 billion. A7A5’s market cap is around $500 million, which makes it one of the largest non‑US‑dollar‑pegged stablecoins. China and Iran maximize on money laundering The report talks about how Chinese Money Laundering Networks (CMLNs) have become a major player in the illegal ecosystem. These networks now offer “laundering-as-a-service” and other specialized criminal infrastructure based on the frameworks set up by companies like Huione Guarantee. These full-service operations support everything from fraud and scams to laundering North Korean hack proceeds, sanctions evasion, and terrorist financing. Iran made similar gains in using crypto. The country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxy network facilitated more than $2 billion in money laundering, illicit oil sales, and the procurement of arms on-chain. According to the report, terrorist organizations aligned with Iran, including Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, are using crypto at unprecedented scales. Chainalysis also warns of growing connections between on-chain activity and violent crime. Human trafficking operations have increasingly leveraged cryptocurrency, while “physical coercion attacks” in which criminals use violence to force victims to transfer assets have risen sharply, often timed to coincide with crypto price peaks. This year, Cryptopolitan has already reported on crypto thieves who terrorized a small investor at home with brutal invasions. The criminal used a gun to demand phone, laptop, and wallet access. Since 2020, more than 215 physical crypto attacks have been recorded worldwide, with 2025 nearly doubling the prior year.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier cryptocurrency is currently trading at $91,022.53 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market as of early trading hours. This price action marks a pivotal moment, potentially signaling a new phase in the ongoing market cycle and capturing the attention of institutional and retail investors globally. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the underlying catalysts and historical precedents for this move. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $91,000 Surge The ascent past $91,000 represents more than a simple numerical milestone. Firstly, it consolidates gains from a sustained upward trend observed over the preceding weeks. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure, particularly in the Asian and European trading sessions. Furthermore, on-chain analytics firms report a notable decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges, suggesting a trend toward accumulation and long-term holding, often called ‘hodling.’ This reduction in readily available supply typically creates upward pressure on price, especially when coupled with steady demand. Simultaneously, trading volume across major spot and derivatives exchanges has spiked significantly. For instance, aggregated volume across the top ten platforms increased by over 40% in the 24 hours leading to the breakout. This volume surge indicates strong conviction among market participants. Moreover, the move occurred with minimal resistance, as the $90,000 level—a key psychological barrier—was breached with relative ease. Technical analysts point to the sustained position above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages as a strong bullish indicator. Key Technical and On-Chain Indicators Several metrics provide context for this rally. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, a sentiment gauge, has entered ‘Extreme Greed’ territory, a common feature during strong bullish phases. However, veteran traders caution that this can also signal overheated conditions. Additionally, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric shows a large portion of the Bitcoin supply is in profit, which can influence holder behavior. Critically, the Hash Rate—a measure of network security and miner commitment—remains near all-time highs, underscoring fundamental network strength. Contextualizing the Rally: Macroeconomic and Sector-Specific Drivers This price movement does not exist in a vacuum. It coincides with broader macroeconomic shifts and specific developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Primarily, evolving monetary policy expectations in major economies have renewed interest in hard assets and alternative stores of value. As traditional markets react to economic data, a portion of capital appears to be rotating into digital assets like Bitcoin, which many perceive as a hedge against currency debasement. Concurrently, regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions has improved institutional adoption pathways. Recent approvals for regulated Bitcoin investment products in key markets have provided a more structured entry point for traditional finance capital. Furthermore, continued development of the Bitcoin network itself, including advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, enhances its utility proposition. Industry reports also highlight growing corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, mirroring actions by several publicly-listed companies over recent years. Recent Bitcoin Price Milestones (Hypothetical Timeline for Context) Price Level Approximate Date (Example) Notable Context $70,000 Previous Resistance Test of previous all-time high region $80,000 Breakout Level Signaled continuation of bull trend $91,000 Current Event New high, testing uncharted territory Expert Perspectives and Market Impact Financial analysts and cryptocurrency researchers are offering measured interpretations of the rally. Many emphasize the importance of sustainable volume and gradual appreciation over volatile spikes. “While crossing $91,000 is psychologically important, the health of the rally is better judged by depth of order books and derivatives market funding rates,” notes a market strategist from a digital asset research firm. Separately, blockchain data analysts observe that long-term holder supply has remained stable, suggesting seasoned investors are not distributing heavily at these levels, which is often a prerequisite for a continued advance. The impact extends beyond Bitcoin’s own market capitalization. Typically, a strong Bitcoin trend influences the broader digital asset sector. Major cryptocurrencies (altcoins) often experience correlated movements, though with varying intensity. This rally has already sparked increased trading activity across the crypto board. Moreover, it positively affects related industries like cryptocurrency mining, where profitability is directly tied to the BTC price, and blockchain infrastructure development, which attracts more investment during bullish phases. Institutional Inflows: Data shows consecutive weeks of positive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and similar regulated products. Network Security: High hash rate makes the network more secure and expensive to attack. Market Sentiment: Shifts from caution to optimism can drive reflexive buying from sidelined capital. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $91,000 marks a definitive moment in the current market cycle, reflecting a confluence of technical strength, improving fundamentals, and a shifting macroeconomic landscape. This Bitcoin price achievement demonstrates the asset’s enduring volatility and capacity for significant appreciation. While market participants celebrate the milestone, experienced observers recommend focusing on long-term adoption metrics, regulatory developments, and network innovation rather than short-term price fluctuations. The journey past this level will be closely watched for signs of consolidation or continued ascent as the cryptocurrency market evolves. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $91,000 mean for the average investor? It signifies a period of high market valuation and potential volatility. For average investors, it underscores the importance of conducting thorough research, understanding risk, and considering a disciplined investment strategy like dollar-cost averaging, rather than reacting to price headlines. Q2: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? This price represents a new all-time high, surpassing the previous peak. The specific value of the prior high depends on the market and timeframe referenced, but breaking into uncharted price territory above $91,000 is a new record for the asset. Q3: What are the main factors that could cause the price to reverse? Potential reversal factors include sudden, adverse regulatory announcements in major economies, a sharp shift in global macroeconomic policy (like aggressive interest rate hikes), a major security incident affecting a large exchange or the network, or a sustained period of negative market sentiment leading to prolonged selling pressure. Q4: Does a high Bitcoin price affect transaction fees and speed? Not directly. Transaction fees and confirmation times on the Bitcoin base layer are primarily determined by network congestion—how many transactions are waiting to be processed—not the USD price of BTC. However, high price periods often correlate with increased network usage, which can raise fees. Q5: Where can investors find reliable, real-time Bitcoin price data? Reliable data can be sourced from major, reputable cryptocurrency exchanges with high liquidity (like Binance, Coinbase), established financial data aggregators (Bloomberg, Reuters), and dedicated crypto market data sites (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap). It’s prudent to cross-reference data from multiple trusted sources.

56983875,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=891378,1767892837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56983875.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum should scale bandwidth before cutting latency,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/vitalik-buterin-bandwidth-over-latency/,cryptopolitan,"Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin said on Thursday that increasing the network’s bandwidth is much safer than reducing latency. He argued that the network can scale with Peer-to-Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). Buterin acknowledged that PeerDAS and ZKPs enable Ethereum to scale thousands of times compared to the status quo. He also revealed an analysis with pre- and post-sharding, showing numbers have become far more favorable than before. The crypto mogul also acknowledged that there’s nothing that prevents combining extreme scale with decentralization on the ETH blockchain. Buterin says Ethereum can decrease latency without tradeoffs Increasing bandwidth is safer than reducing latency With PeerDAS and ZKPs, we know how to scale, and potentially we can scale thousands of times compared to the status quo. The numbers become far more favorable than before (eg. see analysis here, pre and post-sharding… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 8, 2026 Buterin revealed that reducing latency is constrained by the speed of light and the need to support nodes in rural environments worldwide, as well as in-home and commercial environments outside of data centers. He also noted that the need to support censorship-resistance and anonymity for nodes has reduced latency. Ethereum’s co-founder added that reducing latency is limited by the fact that running a node in a non-super-concentrated location must be impossible and also economically viable. He argued that more and more people will stake in New York over time if staking outside the city drops a user’s revenue by 10%. “Ethereum itself must pass the walkaway test, and so we cannot build a blockchain that depends on constant social re-juggling to ensure decentralization. Economics cannot handle the entire load, but it must handle most.” – Vitalik Buterin , Co-Founder of Ethereum. Buterin revealed that Ethereum can reduce latency more from the present-day situation without tradeoffs. He believes ETH can decrease latency by making P2P improvements, especially in erasure coding. He said the initiative can reduce message propagation times without requiring individual nodes to have lower bandwidth. The crypto mogul added that using an available chain with a smaller node count per slot, such as 512 instead of 30,000, can eliminate the need for an aggregation step. He said the initiative can enable the entire latency reduction to occur in one subnet. Buterin acknowledged that P2P improvements and using chains with smaller node counts per slot plausibly purchase ETH 3-6x. He also believes moderate latency can be lowered to a 2-4 level. Buterin referred to Ethereum as the world’s heartbeat, arguing that those planning to build applications that are faster than the heartbeat will require off-chain components. He said it’s a big part of why L2s will continue to have a role even in a greatly scaled Ethereum. Buterin also believes that artificial intelligence will necessitate applications that are faster than the heartbeat, regardless of what developers do. He considers AI-focused applications as inevitable, which he says will require L2 blockchains. The crypto mogul also agrees that it would be costly to make it viable to run a staking node on Mars because even Bitcoin does not focus on that. He said Ethereum ultimately belongs to Tera, and that the blockchain’s L2s will serve both hyper-localized needs in its cities, and hyper-scaled needs globally. Ethereum solves blockchain’s trilemma Ethereum’s co-founder acknowledged earlier this week that ETH had solved blockchain’s trilemma through zkEVMs and PeerDAS technology. He said the combination of both technologies now runs on the mainnet, which has enabled decentralization, high bandwidth, and consensus. He argued that the network’s improvements have shifted ETH into a more powerful and decentralized network. The Ethereum Foundation also plans to enhance the network’s security, requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of the year. The team also seeks to achieve 100-bit security by May 2026. The Ethereum Foundation also requires teams to achieve mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by next month. The foundation warned last month that attackers can forge anything if they can already forge a proof of identity. The firm maintained that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity. George Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team notes that the team’s verification work will reach its full potential once teams have met the targets and the zkVM architecture stabilizes. Buterin also believes that Ethereum needs to do more to meet its stipulated goals. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

56984324,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259656,1767894611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Florida Bitcoin Bill Sparks Bold Move: Proposal to Allocate 10% of State Funds to Cryptocurrency Reserves,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/florida-bitcoin-bill-state-funds/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Florida Bitcoin Bill Sparks Bold Move: Proposal to Allocate 10% of State Funds to Cryptocurrency Reserves In a potentially transformative move for public finance, Florida lawmakers have introduced legislation that could allocate a significant portion of state reserves to Bitcoin, marking one of the most substantial governmental cryptocurrency proposals in United States history. Republican Representative John Snyder filed House Bill 1039 for the 2026 legislative session on February 15, 2025, creating what could become a model for other states considering digital asset integration. This Florida Bitcoin bill specifically authorizes the state’s Chief Financial Officer to establish and manage a cryptocurrency reserve fund, with provisions allowing up to 10% of state funds to flow into Bitcoin investments under a structured risk management framework. Florida Bitcoin Bill Details and Legislative Framework The proposed legislation establishes clear parameters for cryptocurrency investment while granting substantial administrative discretion. House Bill 1039 creates a dedicated cryptocurrency reserve fund separate from traditional state investment vehicles. The bill empowers Florida’s Chief Financial Officer to make all investment decisions regarding Bitcoin and other digital assets. Furthermore, the legislation includes a 10% maximum allocation cap but specifies no minimum investment requirement. This structure provides flexibility while establishing clear guardrails against overexposure. Representative Snyder’s proposal builds upon previous legislative efforts that failed to gain traction in earlier sessions. The current version incorporates several risk mitigation measures absent from earlier drafts. These provisions include mandatory independent audits conducted by qualified third-party firms with cryptocurrency expertise. The bill also establishes a formal advisory committee comprising financial experts, technology specialists, and risk management professionals. This committee will provide ongoing guidance to the CFO regarding market conditions and investment strategies. Historical Context and National Precedents Florida’s cryptocurrency legislation emerges within a broader national conversation about public sector digital asset adoption. Several states have previously explored similar initiatives with varying degrees of success and implementation. For instance, Wyoming established a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in 2019, positioning itself as a cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdiction. Meanwhile, Texas has actively courted cryptocurrency mining operations through favorable energy policies and regulatory clarity. However, Florida’s proposal represents a more direct approach to state treasury management than previous state-level cryptocurrency initiatives. The legislation follows Miami’s earlier efforts to integrate cryptocurrency into municipal operations under Mayor Francis Suarez’s leadership. These local experiments provided valuable data points about practical cryptocurrency implementation at the government level. Nationally, the proposal arrives as multiple states reconsider their investment strategies amid evolving financial landscapes and technological advancements. Comparative Analysis of State Cryptocurrency Initiatives The table below illustrates how Florida’s proposal compares to other state-level cryptocurrency initiatives: State Initiative Type Implementation Status Key Features Florida State Reserve Investment Proposed Legislation 10% maximum allocation, CFO discretion, audit requirements Wyoming Regulatory Framework Implemented Banking charters for crypto businesses, clear token classification Texas Infrastructure Development Ongoing Mining-friendly energy policies, business recruitment Colorado Tax Payments Implemented Accepts cryptocurrency for certain state taxes and fees This comparative perspective reveals Florida’s distinctive approach focusing specifically on treasury management rather than broader ecosystem development. The proposal’s discretionary framework distinguishes it from more prescriptive models adopted elsewhere. Additionally, the 10% allocation cap represents a conservative threshold compared to more aggressive private sector cryptocurrency portfolios. Risk Management Framework and Safeguards House Bill 1039 incorporates multiple layers of protection designed to address legitimate concerns about cryptocurrency volatility and security. The legislation mandates development of a comprehensive risk management framework before any investment occurs. This framework must address several critical areas including market volatility protocols, cybersecurity measures, and liquidity requirements. The proposed structure also establishes clear accountability mechanisms through regular reporting requirements to the legislature. The bill’s security provisions specifically require implementation of institutional-grade custody solutions for any acquired digital assets. These solutions typically involve multi-signature wallets, geographically distributed key storage, and insurance coverage against theft or loss. Furthermore, the legislation authorizes the CFO to establish partnerships with qualified cryptocurrency custodians and investment managers. These partnerships would provide professional oversight beyond what traditional treasury departments typically possess. Independent Audits: Quarterly examinations by certified firms with digital asset expertise Advisory Committee: Seven-member panel including technology and finance experts Transparency Requirements: Public reporting of all cryptocurrency holdings and transactions Volatility Protocols: Defined procedures for managing significant price fluctuations Potential Impacts on Florida’s Financial Landscape The proposed cryptocurrency legislation could generate several significant effects on Florida’s economic and financial environment. Successful implementation might position Florida as a national leader in public sector financial innovation. This leadership could attract cryptocurrency businesses and professionals to the state, potentially boosting economic development. Additionally, early adoption might provide valuable experience that other states could later emulate as digital assets become more mainstream. From a treasury management perspective, cryptocurrency allocation could offer portfolio diversification benefits during periods of traditional market stress. Historical data suggests Bitcoin has exhibited low correlation with conventional asset classes like stocks and bonds. However, this diversification benefit comes with substantially higher volatility than traditional reserve investments. The discretionary nature of the proposal allows Florida’s CFO to time investments based on market conditions rather than following a rigid allocation schedule. Expert Perspectives on Public Sector Cryptocurrency Adoption Financial analysts and cryptocurrency experts have offered mixed assessments of Florida’s legislative proposal. Some experts emphasize the importance of public sector experimentation with emerging financial technologies. They argue that responsible, limited exposure allows governments to develop institutional knowledge about digital assets. Other analysts express concerns about taxpayer fund exposure to cryptocurrency volatility despite the proposed safeguards. Notably, several institutional investment managers have begun allocating small percentages to digital assets in recent years. This trend suggests growing professional acceptance of cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class. Florida’s proposal essentially extends this institutional approach to public sector treasury management. The legislation’s structured framework appears designed to mitigate risks while capturing potential upside from technological adoption. Legislative Process and Implementation Timeline House Bill 1039 must navigate Florida’s standard legislative pathway before potentially becoming law. The proposal will undergo committee review, possible amendments, and floor votes in both legislative chambers. This process typically spans several months and involves multiple opportunities for public input and expert testimony. If approved by the legislature, the bill would proceed to the governor’s desk for final consideration. The legislation specifies an effective date of July 1, 2026, assuming successful passage through all required stages. This timeline allows approximately eighteen months for implementation planning should the bill become law. During this period, the CFO’s office would need to develop detailed operational procedures, select service providers, and establish the advisory committee. The extended timeline reflects the complexity of implementing cryptocurrency management within traditional government structures. Conclusion Florida’s proposed Bitcoin legislation represents a significant milestone in the evolving relationship between government finance and digital assets. House Bill 1039 establishes a cautious yet forward-looking framework for potential cryptocurrency integration into state reserves. The Florida Bitcoin bill balances innovation with protection through its 10% allocation cap, risk management requirements, and oversight mechanisms. While the proposal’s ultimate fate remains uncertain, its introduction signals growing governmental recognition of cryptocurrency’s potential role in public sector finance. As legislative deliberations proceed, this Florida initiative will undoubtedly influence national conversations about appropriate cryptocurrency policies for state governments. FAQs Q1: What percentage of Florida’s funds could be invested in Bitcoin under the proposed bill? The legislation permits investment of up to 10% of state funds in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, though it establishes no minimum investment requirement. Q2: Who would make decisions about cryptocurrency investments under this proposal? Florida’s Chief Financial Officer would exercise complete discretion regarding whether, when, and how much to invest in digital assets. Q3: What safeguards does the bill include to protect state funds? The legislation mandates a risk management framework, independent audits, an advisory committee, institutional custody solutions, and transparency requirements. Q4: How does Florida’s proposal compare to other states’ cryptocurrency initiatives? Florida’s approach focuses specifically on treasury investment rather than broader regulatory frameworks or business development, making it distinctive among state-level cryptocurrency policies. Q5: When could this legislation potentially take effect? If successfully passed through the legislative process, House Bill 1039 would become effective on July 1, 2026, allowing time for implementation planning.

This alarming surge represents the most significant annual jump in illicit crypto activity ever recorded, fundamentally reshaping security discussions across the digital asset ecosystem. The Block first reported these findings, revealing that stablecoins now dominate criminal transactions with unprecedented market penetration. Cryptocurrency Crime Analysis Reveals Unprecedented Growth Patterns Chainalysis researchers emphasize that the $154 billion figure represents a conservative estimate of cryptocurrency crime volume. Their methodology intentionally excludes numerous borderline transactions that could potentially push the total even higher. The 162% year-over-year increase dramatically outpaces previous growth rates observed in 2023 and 2024, indicating accelerating criminal adoption of blockchain technology. This surge coincides with broader cryptocurrency market expansion, yet illicit activity appears to be growing at nearly triple the rate of legitimate market growth. Historical context reveals troubling patterns. In 2024, cryptocurrency crime totaled approximately $58.8 billion according to Chainalysis data. The 2023 figure stood at $42.3 billion. This consistent upward trajectory suggests systemic vulnerabilities rather than isolated incidents. Law enforcement agencies worldwide now face unprecedented challenges tracking cross-border transactions that bypass traditional financial controls. The blockchain’s inherent transparency paradoxically enables sophisticated criminals who understand how to obscure transaction trails through mixing services and privacy protocols. Stablecoins Dominate Illicit Transaction Networks The Chainalysis report delivers a particularly striking finding: stablecoins accounted for 84% of all identified illicit cryptocurrency transactions in 2025. This represents a dramatic shift from previous years when Bitcoin dominated criminal activity. Researchers identify several key factors driving this transition. First, stablecoins offer price stability that traditional cryptocurrencies lack, making them more predictable for criminal enterprises managing large-scale operations. Second, their increasing liquidity across global exchanges facilitates rapid conversion to fiat currencies. Chainalysis analysts suggest criminals increasingly exploit stablecoins due to their low volatility and borderless transfer capabilities. Unlike traditional banking systems, stablecoin transactions bypass geographic restrictions and banking hours. This creates continuous, global money movement opportunities that traditional criminals never previously enjoyed. The report specifically highlights how criminal organizations have adapted their operations to leverage these technological advantages while minimizing exposure to cryptocurrency price fluctuations that previously complicated their financial management. Expert Analysis of Criminal Methodology Evolution Financial crime specialists observe sophisticated adaptation patterns among illicit actors. “Criminal enterprises now operate with business-like precision,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a blockchain forensics expert at Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance. “They’ve moved beyond simple Bitcoin transactions to complex stablecoin-based ecosystems that mirror legitimate corporate treasury management. This represents both a technological and operational evolution that demands corresponding advancements in regulatory response.” The geographical distribution of cryptocurrency crime reveals concentrated hotspots. Southeast Asia accounts for approximately 38% of identified illicit transactions, followed by Eastern Europe at 22% and Latin America at 18%. These regions share common characteristics including developing regulatory frameworks and high cryptocurrency adoption rates. North America represents just 9% of total illicit volume despite having the largest legitimate cryptocurrency markets, suggesting regulatory effectiveness varies significantly by jurisdiction. Comparative Analysis of Illicit Transaction Methods The following table illustrates the evolution of cryptocurrency crime methodologies between 2024 and 2025: Transaction Type 2024 Volume 2025 Volume Growth Rate Stablecoin Transactions $32.1B $129.4B 303% Bitcoin Transactions $18.7B $19.2B 3% Privacy Coin Usage $4.3B $3.1B -28% Exchange-Based Crime $3.7B $2.3B -38% This data reveals several critical trends. Stablecoin usage for illicit purposes grew more than 300% year-over-year, far outpacing other cryptocurrency categories. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s relative share of criminal activity declined significantly despite modest absolute growth. Privacy coins and exchange-based crimes actually decreased in volume, suggesting criminals are shifting toward more mainstream, liquid assets rather than specialized tools that attract regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory Implications and Global Response Framework The explosive growth of cryptocurrency crime has triggered urgent regulatory discussions worldwide. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently accelerated its timeline for implementing enhanced cryptocurrency monitoring standards. Meanwhile, national governments are developing coordinated responses. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation now includes specific provisions addressing stablecoin oversight. Similarly, the United States Treasury Department has proposed new reporting requirements for transactions exceeding $10,000 involving self-hosted wallets. Industry responses demonstrate increasing sophistication. Major cryptocurrency exchanges have implemented enhanced due diligence protocols, particularly for stablecoin transactions. These measures include: Advanced transaction monitoring using artificial intelligence to detect suspicious patterns Increased information sharing between exchanges and regulatory bodies Stricter wallet verification requirements for large stablecoin transfers Real-time analytics that flag transactions matching known criminal methodologies Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain. The decentralized nature of many stablecoin protocols complicates enforcement actions. Additionally, jurisdictional conflicts create enforcement gaps that criminal organizations systematically exploit. International cooperation has improved but still lags behind the borderless nature of blockchain technology. Technological Solutions and Industry Innovations Blockchain analytics firms are developing increasingly sophisticated tools to combat cryptocurrency crime. Chainalysis recently unveiled its “Reactor” platform update, which incorporates machine learning algorithms capable of identifying previously undetectable transaction patterns. Meanwhile, Elliptic has launched a stablecoin-specific monitoring system that tracks over 200 billion data points across multiple blockchain networks. These technological advancements represent crucial components of the broader security ecosystem. Academic institutions contribute significantly to this evolving landscape. Stanford University’s Blockchain Research Center recently published findings demonstrating how graph analysis techniques can identify criminal networks with 94% accuracy. Their methodology analyzes transaction patterns rather than individual addresses, enabling detection of sophisticated money laundering operations that previously evaded identification. This research directly informs both regulatory approaches and industry best practices. Market Impact and Investor Considerations The cryptocurrency crime surge has tangible effects on legitimate market participants. Institutional investors increasingly demand enhanced security protocols before allocating capital to digital assets. Insurance premiums for cryptocurrency custodians have risen approximately 40% year-over-year, reflecting heightened risk assessments. Meanwhile, retail investors face growing concerns about exchange security and asset protection. Market data reveals interesting correlations. During periods of high cryptocurrency crime reporting, legitimate transaction volumes typically decline by 5-8% as risk-averse participants temporarily withdraw. However, long-term adoption trends remain positive, suggesting the market is developing resilience despite security challenges. This resilience stems partly from technological improvements in security infrastructure and partly from growing regulatory clarity that provides legitimate participants with clearer operating frameworks. Conclusion The cryptocurrency crime landscape underwent dramatic transformation in 2025, with illicit transaction volume surging 162% to reach $154 billion according to Chainalysis data. This unprecedented growth, dominated by stablecoin transactions accounting for 84% of criminal activity, presents complex challenges for regulators, industry participants, and law enforcement agencies worldwide. The shift toward stablecoins reflects criminal adaptation to technological advantages including price stability and borderless transfer capabilities. Addressing this cryptocurrency crime surge requires coordinated international response, technological innovation, and enhanced regulatory frameworks that balance security concerns with innovation preservation. As the digital asset ecosystem continues evolving, ongoing vigilance and adaptation remain essential for maintaining market integrity and protecting legitimate participants. FAQs Q1: What percentage of total cryptocurrency transactions are illicit according to the 2025 data? Chainalysis estimates that illicit transactions represent approximately 0.8% of total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2025, though this percentage varies significantly across different blockchain networks and asset types. Q2: Why are criminals increasingly using stablecoins instead of Bitcoin? Criminal organizations prefer stablecoins due to their price stability, which simplifies financial management, and their widespread liquidity across global exchanges, which facilitates rapid conversion to fiat currencies without significant price slippage. Q3: How does Chainalysis track and identify illicit cryptocurrency transactions? Chainalysis employs sophisticated blockchain analytics combining transaction pattern recognition, address clustering algorithms, and machine learning models that compare activity against known criminal methodologies and reported incidents. Q4: What regions show the highest concentration of cryptocurrency crime activity? Southeast Asia accounts for approximately 38% of identified illicit cryptocurrency transactions, followed by Eastern Europe (22%) and Latin America (18%), according to 2025 geographic distribution data. Q5: How are regulators responding to the increase in cryptocurrency crime? Regulatory responses include enhanced transaction monitoring requirements, stricter exchange licensing standards, international cooperation frameworks like the FATF guidelines, and proposed legislation addressing specific vulnerabilities in stablecoin oversight and cross-border transfers.

($GOOG) , the parent company of Google, has officially overtaken Apple Inc. to become the world’s second-most valuable company by market capitalization, marking a major shift in the tech hierarchy. As of trading this week, Alphabet’s market cap reached roughly $3.88 trillion, slightly surpassing Apple’s valuation of around $3.85 trillion — a position the search giant hadn’t held since 2019. The milestone highlights Google’s resurgence as a leader in artificial intelligence and cloud technologies, areas where its competitors have struggled to keep pace. Alphabet’s stock has jumped sharply in recent months, rising significantly higher than Apple’s thanks in part to strong momentum around its Gemini AI model and custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). While Nvidia still holds the top global market valuation at over $4.5 trillion, Alphabet’s rise speaks to its broad influence across search, ads, AI, and autonomous tech via Waymo. Investors have rewarded Google’s diversified growth outlook, in contrast with Apple’s more modest gains as it contends with talent departures and delays in AI-focused product rollouts. Capital Flows Shift Toward AI and Digital Assets The reshuffle in market capitalization reflects a broader reallocation of global capital rather than a purely equity-driven story. In 2025 alone, the combined market value of the so-called “AI trade”, led by Alphabet, Nvidia , and Microsoft , increased by more than $3.5 trillion, driven largely by data-center expansion, cloud revenue growth, and AI infrastructure spending. During the same period, Bitcoin’s market capitalization climbed above $1.6 trillion at its peak, up more than 120% year over year, according to market data. Institutional participation has been a key driver: US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $40 billion in net inflows in 2025, while several large asset managers increased crypto exposure alongside AI-linked equities. Notably, Bitcoin briefly ranked among the top five global assets by market capitalization, placing it in the same valuation range as mega-cap technology companies during periods of peak demand. This crossover underscores crypto’s growing role as a macro asset rather than a purely speculative instrument. Analysts note that the same fundamentals supporting Google’s rise — aggressive capital expenditure on compute, control over data pipelines, and platform network effects are increasingly relevant to blockchain infrastructure. In 2025, total spending on blockchain and Web3 infrastructure exceeded $60 billion globally, with smart contract platforms seeing rising institutional validator participation. Public signals also point to convergence. Over the past year, executives from Alphabet, Nvidia, and BlackRock have publicly discussed tokenization, on-chain settlement, and AI-blockchain integration at major industry events and in regulatory filings. Alphabet’s move past Apple therefore reflects more than shifting sentiment toward AI. It highlights a structural transition in how markets value scalable platforms, whether they power search and cloud services or decentralized financial networks with both tech and crypto now competing for the same long-term institutional capital.",News|Business,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The Supreme Court rejected an appeal from someone caught up in a money laundering case who argued that Bitcoin kept on an exchange isn’t a physical item and therefore can’t be seized. The case started when police took 55.6 Bitcoin from an exchange account during their investigation. The digital currency was worth around 600 million Korean won, or about $413,000, when authorities grabbed it. The account belonged to a person referred to only as Mr. A. Mr. A pushed back against the seizure. He said the country’s Criminal Procedure Act only allows police to take “physical objects” as evidence or for confiscation. Since Bitcoin exists only as digital data, he claimed it didn’t fit that description under Article 106 of the law. A lower court in Seoul threw out his complaint, saying the seizure was legal. Mr. A then took his case to the Supreme Court last December. The country’s top judges sided with prosecutors. They said the criminal law covers both physical items and electronic information. “Under the Criminal Procedure Act, seizure targets include both tangible objects and electronic information,” the court stated. It explained that Bitcoin works “as an electronic token with the ability to be independently managed, traded, and substantially controlled in terms of economic value.” The court concluded that Bitcoin meets the standard for an asset that investigators can seize. “The disposition in this case, which seized Bitcoin under Mr. A’s name managed by a virtual asset exchange, is lawful, and there is no error in the lower court’s decision to dismiss the motion for reconsideration,” the ruling said. Previous rulings recognized bitcoin as property This isn’t the first time Korean courts have dealt with cryptocurrency. The Supreme Court ruled back in 2018 that Bitcoin is intangible property with actual economic value, meaning it can be seized if you obtained it illegally. Courts that same year also started treating crypto tokens as divisible assets in divorce proceedings. By 2021, judges were clearly treating Bitcoin as virtual property with economic value under criminal law. The ruling comes as South Korean authorities have intensified their crackdown on crypto-related crimes , with multiple cases involving cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering making headlines. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , a crypto exchange operator was sentenced to four years in prison for attempting to sell military secrets to North Korea in exchange for Bitcoin. South Korea isn’t alone in this Last month, the UK passed legislation officially recognizing digital assets as property, giving them the same legal status as houses, cars, and other traditional assets. The law came out of recommendations from the Law Commission of England and Wales and is designed to help courts navigate theft, inheritance, and bankruptcy cases involving crypto. Etay Katz, who leads the digital assets team at law firm Ashurst, called the UK law “a welcome and timely statutory recognition of the fundamental property quality in crypto assets” when speaking to Decrypt.

Meanwhile, CoinCodex projects choppy consolidation, with BTC holding the mid $80,000s before drifting toward the low to mid $90,000s into January 2026. Morgan Stanley Moves Toward Tokenized Asset Wallet Morgan Stanley is preparing to launch a digital wallet for tokenized assets later this year, according to reporting from financial media outlets , The product forms part of the bank’s broader digital asset strategy and focuses on blockchain based representations of traditional financial instruments rather than retail cryptocurrency storage. The wallet is expected to support tokenized funds and other tokenized financial products, allowing institutional and high net worth clients to hold and manage assets issued on blockchain networks. People familiar with the plans say the project targets professional use cases tied to capital markets, private assets, and structured products. At the same time, the initiative reflects Morgan Stanley’s growing involvement in regulated digital finance. The bank has expanded its exposure through exchange traded funds, custody related infrastructure, and blockchain research tied to asset tokenization. As a result, the wallet fits into an existing framework rather than signaling a shift toward consumer crypto services. In parallel, Morgan Stanley is moving ahead with crypto trading access on its E*Trade platform, which is expected to roll out in the first half of 2026. That service will allow clients to trade select digital assets through third party infrastructure. However, the trading feature operates separately from the planned tokenized asset wallet. So far, Morgan Stanley has not disclosed technical specifications, custody arrangements, or the exact asset classes that will be supported at launch. Still, available reporting suggests the wallet will roll out gradually and remain aligned with regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. Bitcoin Drops Below $90K Then Reclaims It as Morgan Stanley Wallet Headline Circulates Meanwhile, Bitcoin sold off over the last day on the 1 hour Bitstamp chart, then bounced back above the $90,000 level. Price faded from the low $93,000s on Jan. 7, slid through $92,000, and then continued lower into the high $89,000s to low $90,000s before buyers pushed it back up.

The projected path on the chart points to BTC holding above the mid-$80,000 range, followed by a gradual move back toward the low-to-mid $90,000 area as January 2026 unfolds.

But then it crashed to around $80,000 by the end of the year, according to CoinMetrics data. But the OG crypto is now down by like 30%, and no one seems to agree on where it’s going next. For 2026, crypto analysts and execs are predicting price numbers for Bitcoin anywhere from $75,000 to $225,000 in 2026, with volatility guaranteed. Experts give price ranges and reasons for their 2026 Bitcoin calls Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex, says Bitcoin’s price will bounce between $75,000 and $150,000 in 2026, settling “around $110,000.” Carol has had a decent record with previous predictions, like back in 2023, she called for a 2025 peak of $150,000, give or take $50K. During summer 2025, Bitcoin did go over $100,000, but her earlier $200,000 prediction hasn’t happened… yet. At CoinShares, head of research James Butterfill said he expects Bitcoin to land between $120,000 and $170,000 this year, adding that price action will improve once markets know who replaces Jerome Powell at the Fed when he leaves in May. “The new person is likely to be dovish. Regulation has been a persistent overhang; resolution here would be a meaningful catalyst.” Butterfill’s track record isn’t spotless either, though. I mean, he did correctly predict a crash to $80,000 in 2025, but his call for $150,000 didn’t come true last year. DAT firms pull back while ETFs pick up the slack Standard Chartered dropped its forecast from $300,000 to $150,000 in December. Geoff Kendrick, who leads the bank’s digital asset research team, said the 2025 dip was “within expected bounds,” but it forced them to revise the number. He said digital asset treasury (DAT) companies aren’t buying anymore. These firms had loaded up on Bitcoin, hoping to outperform markets. But with prices now lower and capital drying up , they’ve hit pause. “Valuations no longer support further Bitcoin DAT expansion,” Kendrick wrote. “We expect a consolidation rather than outright selling, but DAT buying is unlikely to provide further support.” ETFs, however, could still drive demand. Kendrick said any future Bitcoin growth is “likely to be driven by one leg only – ETF buying.” These products let people track Bitcoin without owning it, and Kendrick expects them to pick up the slack left by DAT firms. Institutional lending, tokenization, and new money flows will determine 2026 At Maple Finance, CEO Sidney Powell set a target of $175,000 for Bitcoin in 2026. He’s banking on two forces: rate cuts and more institutional adoption. Back in December 2024, he warned of corrections in 2025, which did happen. But his call for $200,000 that year didn’t land. Powell’s new bet for 2026 is based on lending. Sidney says Bitcoin-backed lending will pass $100 billion this year. “Bitcoin holders are becoming more and more sophisticated,” he added. “They don’t want to sell their BTC; they want to borrow against it. This creates a virtuous cycle: less selling pressure, more utility, higher prices.” Youwei Yang, chief economist at Bit Mining, isn’t narrowing it down at all. His forecast stretches from $75,000 to $225,000, and he says that kind of range is expected in today’s climate.“2026 could be a strong year for Bitcoin,” Youwei said. He cited possible rate cuts, a friendlier regulatory tone, and new liquidity as drivers. But he also warned: “Heightened volatility is likely amid current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.” Youwei’s 2024 call was halfway correct. He called for a fall to $80,000 in 2025, which happened. But his $180,000 to $190,000 target didn’t pan out. Nexo analyst Iliya Kalchev blamed missed price targets on shifting market mechanics. Their 2025 call of $250,000 didn’t hit because long-term holders started dumping, and institutions scooped up the leftovers. For 2026, Kalchev said, “Bitcoin is entering 2026 with less supply risk and a bigger capital base.” He added that if we see looser policy, a weaker dollar, or more liquidity, Bitcoin could test or even break past old highs. Coinbase gets a vote of confidence from BofA amid company’s product push While all these price calls flood the headlines, Bank of America is betting on Coinbase. The bank upgraded the stock to Buy and kept its $340 price target. Coinbase stock has fallen 5% over the past year and 37% in the last quarter. But BofA analyst Craig Siegenthaler said the company is moving fast despite the downturn. “While the stock is off 40% from its July highs, under the surface of the 4Q25 crypto correction the company’s product velocity has increased and its [total addressable market] expanded in parallel,” he wrote. Coinbase announced in December that it’s getting into stock and ETF trading, as well as prediction markets. Siegenthaler said this could help the company become an “ everything exchange ,” adding that cross-selling more products to users could grow the platform. He also pointed out Coinbase’s move into infrastructure with Base, a layer-2 blockchain. That network is decentralized and permissionless. A native token is coming soon, and Siegenthaler says it’ll bring in billions. He also highlighted Coinbase Tokenize, a new platform for institutions looking to tokenize real-world assets. “Asset managers are looking to tokenize their investment products as they look to take advantage of the benefits of blockchain rails and address the growing parallel market on-chain of younger investors,” Siegenthaler said . He believes Donald Trump’s White House is helping the case too. The president’s crypto-friendly stance is expected to give Coinbase an edge. Siegenthaler said the company’s status makes it “the perfect TradFi partner.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Analysis of blockchain metrics from March 2025 indicates that while new investors continue selling at losses, major financial institutions like BlackRock are accumulating substantial Bitcoin positions, creating a unique market environment that historically precedes recovery periods. BlackRock’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation Signals Institutional Confidence BlackRock has dramatically increased its Bitcoin holdings over the past three days, according to verified blockchain data. The world’s largest asset manager acquired 9,619 BTC during this period, representing approximately $878 million in value at current prices. This substantial purchase brings BlackRock’s total Bitcoin holdings to 780,400 BTC, establishing the firm as one of the largest institutional holders of the cryptocurrency globally. This accumulation pattern represents a continuation of BlackRock’s strategic positioning in digital assets since receiving regulatory approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2024. The firm’s consistent buying activity contrasts sharply with broader market sentiment, suggesting institutional investors may possess different market timing strategies than retail participants. Financial analysts note that BlackRock’s accumulation typically follows rigorous fundamental analysis rather than short-term price movements. Institutional Versus Retail Behavior Patterns Institutional accumulation patterns differ significantly from retail investment behavior in several key aspects: Time Horizon: Institutions typically employ longer investment timeframes Volume Timing: Large purchases often occur during market uncertainty Data Analysis: Institutional decisions rely on comprehensive on-chain metrics Risk Management: Professional investors use sophisticated hedging strategies Critical On-Chain Metrics Reveal Changing Market Dynamics Several blockchain indicators provide objective evidence of shifting market conditions. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, which measures the movement of long-dormant Bitcoin, has reached its lowest level since 2017 according to Binance data. This significant decline indicates that long-term holders are reducing their selling activity, potentially removing downward pressure from the market. Concurrently, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) shows distinct behavioral patterns between investor cohorts. While newer investors continue selling at losses, long-term holders maintain profitable positions and have significantly reduced their transaction activity. This divergence creates a complex market environment where different investor groups exhibit contrasting behaviors based on their entry points and investment horizons. Key Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Analysis (March 2025) Metric Current Value Historical Significance Market Implication Coin Days Destroyed Lowest since 2017 Indicates reduced selling from long-term holders Decreased downward pressure Net Unrealized Profit/Loss Approximately 0.3 Historically precedes market recoveries Potential trend reversal signal Spent Output Profit Ratio New investors at loss Shows capitulation among recent buyers Possible market bottom formation Exchange Deposits Sharply reduced Indicates decreased selling intent Reduced immediate supply pressure Historical Context of Bitcoin Market Transitions Bitcoin markets have experienced similar institutional-retail divergences during previous cycle transitions. Historical analysis reveals that institutional accumulation during periods of retail selling often precedes significant market movements. The current Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric hovering around 0.3 aligns with levels that have historically marked transition phases between bear and bull markets. Market analysts reference several previous instances where similar metric alignments occurred: 2015-2016: Institutional interest emerged during retail capitulation 2018-2019: Similar NUPL levels preceded the 2020-2021 bull market 2022-2023: Institutional accumulation began during market lows These historical patterns provide context for understanding current market dynamics. However, analysts emphasize that each market cycle possesses unique characteristics influenced by regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and technological advancements. Expert Analysis of Current Market Conditions Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency markets note several important considerations. The convergence of multiple on-chain metrics suggesting reduced selling pressure, combined with substantial institutional accumulation, creates a compelling narrative for potential trend change. However, experts caution that market transitions typically occur gradually rather than as sudden reversals. Market structure analysis reveals that Bitcoin currently exhibits characteristics of accumulation phases rather than clear bull market conditions. This distinction is crucial for investor understanding, as accumulation phases often involve extended periods of price consolidation and volatility before sustained upward movements begin. Broader Market Implications and Future Considerations The current market dynamics extend beyond Bitcoin to influence the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Institutional participation patterns often serve as leading indicators for altcoin markets, though with varying time lags and correlation strengths. The growing divergence between institutional and retail behavior may signal changing market maturity as professional investors represent an increasing proportion of market participation. Several factors could influence how these dynamics develop: Regulatory developments affecting institutional participation Macroeconomic conditions influencing risk asset allocation Technological advancements in blockchain infrastructure Market liquidity conditions affecting price discovery Market participants should monitor these factors alongside on-chain metrics to develop comprehensive market assessments. The interaction between institutional accumulation patterns and retail selling behavior will likely continue influencing Bitcoin’s price discovery process throughout 2025. Conclusion The convergence of BlackRock’s substantial Bitcoin accumulation with declining retail selling pressure suggests the cryptocurrency market may be entering a gradual trend reversal phase. Critical on-chain metrics including Coin Days Destroyed, SOPR, and NUPL provide objective evidence of changing market dynamics. While these indicators historically precede market recoveries, current conditions suggest Bitcoin remains in an accumulation phase rather than a clear bull market. The growing divergence between institutional and retail behavior patterns highlights increasing market maturity as professional investors represent a larger proportion of market participation. Continued monitoring of these dynamics will provide valuable insights into Bitcoin’s potential trend reversal and future market direction. FAQs Q1: What does BlackRock’s Bitcoin accumulation indicate about market sentiment? BlackRock’s substantial Bitcoin accumulation suggests institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value proposition, despite short-term market volatility. This pattern indicates professional investors may view current prices as attractive entry points based on fundamental analysis rather than short-term sentiment. Q2: How does the Coin Days Destroyed metric relate to market pressure? The Coin Days Destroyed metric measures the movement of long-dormant Bitcoin. When this metric reaches low levels, it indicates reduced selling from long-term holders, potentially decreasing downward price pressure as these investors typically control substantial Bitcoin supplies. Q3: What is the significance of the NUPL metric hovering around 0.3? The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss metric at approximately 0.3 historically indicates that the market is transitioning from a bear to bull phase. This level has frequently preceded significant price recoveries in previous Bitcoin market cycles, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Q4: How do institutional and retail investment patterns differ in cryptocurrency markets? Institutional investors typically employ longer time horizons, conduct more comprehensive fundamental analysis, and use sophisticated risk management strategies. Retail investors often exhibit more emotional decision-making and shorter investment horizons, creating behavioral divergences during market transitions. Q5: What distinguishes an accumulation phase from a bull market in cryptocurrency? Accumulation phases involve extended periods of price consolidation with institutional buying and retail uncertainty, while bull markets feature sustained upward price movements with broad participation. The current market exhibits characteristics of accumulation rather than clear bull market conditions.

56986373,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259919,1767899411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Morgan Stanley Crypto Trading on E*Trade: A Pivotal Shift for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in H1",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/morgan-stanley-crypto-trading-etrade/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Morgan Stanley Crypto Trading on E*Trade: A Pivotal Shift for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in H1 In a landmark development for financial markets, Morgan Stanley is poised to enable direct trading of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) for clients of its online brokerage giant, E*Trade, within the first half of this year. This strategic expansion, first reported by Barron’s, signals a profound acceleration in the institutional embrace of digital assets and fundamentally alters the accessibility landscape for millions of investors. Furthermore, the firm is actively exploring stock tokenization to revolutionize efficiency in private market trading and settlement, building upon its previously disclosed plans for a digital asset wallet. Morgan Stanley Crypto Trading: Decoding the E*Trade Integration Morgan Stanley’s decision to integrate cryptocurrency trading directly into the E*Trade platform represents a calculated evolution of its digital asset strategy. Initially, the bank offered Bitcoin exposure to its wealthiest clients through private funds and external vehicles like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Consequently, this new move democratizes access, bringing it to the broader E*Trade user base. The selection of assets—Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana—is particularly significant. It reflects a tiered approach: Bitcoin as digital gold, Ethereum as the leading smart contract platform, and Solana as a high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications. Industry analysts immediately recognized the implications. “This is a watershed moment,” stated a report from Bernstein, a global investment firm. “A major wirehouse bringing spot crypto trading to its retail brokerage arm validates the asset class for a mainstream audience that has been cautiously observing from the sidelines.” The integration likely involves robust custody solutions and regulatory compliance frameworks, areas where Morgan Stanley’s extensive experience provides a critical trust layer for cautious investors. The Ripple Effect on Institutional Adoption The announcement creates immediate ripple effects across the financial sector. Firstly, it places competitive pressure on other traditional brokerages like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, which have also been building crypto capabilities. Secondly, it provides a regulated, familiar gateway for millions of investors who may have been hesitant to use native crypto exchanges. Finally, it lends substantial credibility to the underlying blockchain technology, moving the conversation beyond pure speculation toward infrastructure and utility. Beyond Trading: The Strategic Vision of Stock Tokenization Perhaps more transformative than the trading news is Morgan Stanley’s parallel investigation into stock tokenization. The firm explicitly stated it is considering this technology to improve the efficiency of trading and settlement in private markets. Tokenization involves converting ownership rights of a real-world asset, like a share of a private company, into a digital token on a blockchain. This process can unlock immense value by solving long-standing market inefficiencies. 24/7 Market Access: Tokenized assets can potentially trade around the clock, unlike traditional markets. Faster Settlement: Blockchain enables settlement in minutes or seconds, not days (T+2), reducing counterparty risk. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows for dividing high-value private equity investments into smaller, more affordable units, increasing liquidity and access. Automated Compliance: Smart contracts can encode regulatory rules directly into the token, streamlining processes. Morgan Stanley’s exploration here aligns with broader Wall Street initiatives. For instance, giants like JPMorgan are actively using their own blockchain, Onyx, for tokenized collateral movements. The bank’s planned digital wallet, reported earlier by Bitcoin World, is logically the cornerstone for holding both these new tradable cryptocurrencies and future tokenized securities, creating a unified digital asset ecosystem for clients. Contextual Timeline: Morgan Stanley’s Measured Crypto Journey This move is not an abrupt shift but the latest step in a deliberate, multi-year strategy. Understanding this timeline is crucial for assessing its significance. Year Milestone Significance 2021 Offered Bitcoin funds to wealthy clients. Initial, restricted institutional access. 2023 Explored Bitcoin ETFs for brokerage clients. Preparing infrastructure for broader products. Late 2024 Reported plans for a digital asset wallet. Building the custody and storage foundation. H1 2025 E*Trade BTC, ETH, SOL trading launch. Mainstream, direct access for retail brokerage clients. 2025+ Potential stock tokenization projects. Transforming private market infrastructure. This phased approach demonstrates a focus on risk management and regulatory alignment. Each step builds upon the last, ensuring systems are secure and compliant before expanding access. The reported H1 2025 timeline for E*Trade suggests these foundational boxes are now checked. Evidence and Expert Perspective on Market Impact The potential market impact is substantial. E*Trade boasts a user base in the millions. Even a small percentage of those users allocating a portion of their portfolio to the new crypto offerings could represent billions in new capital inflows. Moreover, data from the Blockchain Association shows that institutional involvement typically reduces volatility over the long term, contributing to market maturation. “The entry of a firm with Morgan Stanley’s reputation acts as a powerful signal to other institutional allocators,” explained a managing director at a crypto-focused hedge fund. “It reduces the perceived career risk for asset managers considering digital assets. The focus on tokenization, however, is the real game-changer. It directly addresses trillion-dollar inefficiencies in private markets, which is where the largest financial institutions truly care to innovate.” Conclusion Morgan Stanley’s plan to launch Morgan Stanley crypto trading for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana on E*Trade is far more than a new product listing. It is a pivotal inflection point that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. By providing a trusted, familiar conduit for millions of investors and simultaneously pioneering the tokenization of private stocks, the firm is not just participating in a trend but actively shaping the future architecture of capital markets. This dual-track strategy of enabling access today while building the infrastructure of tomorrow underscores a profound, long-term commitment to blockchain’s transformative potential. FAQs Q1: When exactly will Morgan Stanley start offering crypto trading on E*Trade? The firm has indicated a launch window within the first half (H1) of this year. An exact date has not been publicly specified, but integration and testing are likely in advanced stages. Q2: What cryptocurrencies will be available for trading initially? According to reports, the initial rollout will support trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This selection covers major store-of-value, smart contract platform, and high-throughput blockchain assets. Q3: How does this differ from Morgan Stanley’s previous crypto offerings? Previously, access was limited to high-net-worth clients through third-party funds. The E*Trade integration brings direct spot trading of the cryptocurrencies themselves to the firm’s much larger base of retail brokerage clients. Q4: What is stock tokenization, and why is Morgan Stanley interested? Stock tokenization is the process of converting shares of a company into digital tokens on a blockchain. Morgan Stanley is exploring it to make trading and settlement in private markets faster, more efficient, and more accessible through fractional ownership. Q5: Will this affect the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana? While short-term price movements are unpredictable, the introduction of a massive new, regulated channel for investor demand from a trusted institution is widely viewed by analysts as a structurally bullish, long-term development for the asset class.

The insights come from Matthew Sigel, the firm’s Head of Digital Assets Research, and Senior Investment Analyst Patrick Bush, who have employed a valuation framework based on Bitcoin’s role in two primary total addressable markets: as a medium of exchange (MoE) and as a reserve asset for central banks. VanEck Projects 15% CAGR For Bitcoin In their analysis, Sigel and Bush project a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from Bitcoin’s current levels, which would position the cryptocurrency as a significant player in the global economy.

Analysts Draw Correlations The report outlines two structural shifts that they believe will be pivotal for Bitcoin’s appreciation. The first, dubbed the Settlement Pivot, predicts that by 2050, Bitcoin will be responsible for settling between 5% and 10% of global international trade, as well as 5% of domestic trade transactions. The second crucial aspect, referred to as the Reserve Pivot, connects Bitcoin’s potential growth to waning trust in G7 sovereign debt. As confidence in these currencies diminishes, the authors anticipate that central banks might allocate resources toward Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability. Yet, the VanEck report does not stop at a mere base case; it also explores a more optimistic scenario termed the Bull Case. ‘Hyper-Bitcoinization’ In this scenario, known as “hyper-bitcoinization,” if Bitcoin captures 20% of international trade and 10% of domestic GDP, its value could skyrocket to $53.4 million per coin, representing a major 29% CAGR. Achieving this would require Bitcoin to either equal or surpass gold’s status as a primary global reserve asset, making up nearly 30% of financial assets worldwide.

Interestingly, it incorporates a Bear Case target of $130,000, reflecting a modest 2% CAGR. In terms of correlation, VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin will exhibit low to moderate correlation with global equities, bonds, and gold over various market cycles. Notably, they emphasize a persistent negative correlation with the US Dollar (DXY), reinforcing Bitcoin’s potential role as a hedge against monetary debasement.

56986754,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259925,1767900311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"VanEck Predicts Staggering $2.9M Bitcoin Price by 2050, Citing Inevitable Institutional Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vanecks-staggering-bitcoin-2050-prediction/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld VanEck Predicts Staggering $2.9M Bitcoin Price by 2050, Citing Inevitable Institutional Shift In a landmark analysis that recalibrates long-term financial expectations, global asset manager VanEck has projected a potential future where Bitcoin (BTC) reaches a valuation of $2.9 million per coin by the year 2050. This audacious forecast, reported by CryptoBriefing in March 2025, moves beyond mere price speculation to outline a fundamental shift in the global monetary architecture. Consequently, the firm posits that the opportunity cost of excluding Bitcoin from a portfolio may now surpass its notorious volatility risk. Deconstructing VanEck’s $2.9 Million Bitcoin Prediction VanEck’s report constructs its $2.9 million Bitcoin price target on a foundation of macroeconomic trends and adoption metrics, not short-term trading patterns. Specifically, the firm’s model assumes a 15% average annual return over the next 25 years. However, this growth is tied directly to two concrete utility benchmarks for 2050. Firstly, Bitcoin is expected to facilitate 5% to 10% of all global trade settlements. Secondly, it could comprise approximately 2.5% of central bank reserve assets worldwide. Therefore, the prediction hinges on Bitcoin’s evolution from a speculative asset to a systemic financial tool. This projection arrives amid a significant maturation phase for cryptocurrency markets. Regulatory frameworks, particularly in major economies like the United States and the European Union, are gradually clarifying. Meanwhile, established financial institutions are launching spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and custody services. VanEck’s analysis suggests these are not isolated events but early indicators of a decades-long integration process. The firm explicitly states that long-term appreciation will stem from global currency devaluation and institutional adoption, deliberately distancing the forecast from speculative frenzy. The Macroeconomic Engine: Currency Devaluation and Reserve Status The primary driver behind VanEck’s optimistic Bitcoin valuation is the persistent devaluation of traditional fiat currencies, often called inflation. Central banks globally have engaged in expansive monetary policies for decades, increasing money supply to stimulate economies. Over a 25-year horizon, this trend historically erodes purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its verifiably scarce supply capped at 21 million coins, presents a stark contrast. It acts as a hedge, similar to gold, but with digital-native advantages like ease of transfer and programmable features. From Alternative Asset to Reserve Balance Sheet Component The report’s claim that Bitcoin could constitute 2.5% of central bank reserves is particularly consequential. Currently, central bank reserves are dominated by the US dollar, euro, gold, and other sovereign currencies. Allocating even a small percentage to Bitcoin would represent a seismic shift in legitimacy and demand. For context, global foreign exchange reserves totaled approximately $12 trillion in 2024. A 2.5% allocation would equate to $300 billion of direct, institutional demand for Bitcoin, not including private sector replication. This scenario provides the fundamental demand-side math supporting the price model. Furthermore, the prediction of Bitcoin settling 5-10% of trade points to its utility beyond a store of value. Large international transactions face friction from currency conversion, delays, and intermediary costs. Bitcoin’s blockchain enables peer-to-peer settlement of high value in a matter of minutes, regardless of jurisdiction. Adoption for trade settlement would cement its role as a functional pillar of global finance, not merely an investment vehicle. Assessing the Risk-Reward Calculus for Investors VanEck’s concluding statement about opportunity cost versus volatility risk encapsulates a changing narrative. Historically, financial advisors cited Bitcoin’s extreme price swings as a primary reason for avoidance. The firm’s analysis suggests the calculus is flipping. If Bitcoin achieves even a fraction of the proposed adoption benchmarks, missing its growth could significantly underperform a multi-asset portfolio. The report implies that for long-term investors, the risk of being absent may now outweigh the risk of being present. This perspective aligns with modern portfolio theory, which advocates for uncorrelated assets to improve risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin has frequently demonstrated a low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds. Its inclusion, even in a small allocation, can potentially reduce overall portfolio volatility over extended periods. The table below contrasts traditional drivers of Bitcoin’s value with the institutional drivers highlighted by VanEck: Historical/Retail Drivers Future/Institutional Drivers (VanEck Thesis) Speculative trading & hype cycles Reserve asset diversification by nations Retail adoption as digital payment Settlement layer for billion-dollar trade Fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) sentiment Macro hedge against currency devaluation Technological novelty & ideology Mature regulatory clarity & ETF accessibility Nevertheless, the path to 2050 remains fraught with challenges. These include: Regulatory Hurdles: Uncoordinated global regulations could stifle adoption. Technological Evolution: Bitcoin must scale efficiently without compromising decentralization. Market Competition: Other digital assets or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could capture some of the projected utility. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen geopolitical or technological disruptions remain a constant variable. Conclusion VanEck’s prediction of a $2.9 million Bitcoin price by 2050 provides a rigorous, institutionally-focused framework for evaluating the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. By tethering its valuation to real-world adoption metrics in trade and central banking, the report moves the conversation from pure speculation to fundamental analysis. While the future is inherently uncertain, the analysis underscores a critical shift: Bitcoin’s investment thesis is increasingly viewed through the lens of macroeconomics and portfolio strategy rather than short-term volatility. Ultimately, VanEck’s model presents a vision where Bitcoin transcends its origins to become a integrated, albeit niche, component of the global financial system. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason VanEck gives for Bitcoin reaching $2.9 million by 2050? VanEck attributes the potential growth primarily to Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against global fiat currency devaluation and its adoption by institutions, specifically for a portion of global trade settlements and as a component of central bank reserves. Q2: Does VanEck’s prediction mean Bitcoin’s volatility will disappear? No. The report acknowledges volatility but argues that for long-term investors, the opportunity cost of missing potential adoption-driven gains may now outweigh the risk of holding the volatile asset. Q3: How does Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset help its price? If central banks allocate even a small percentage (like 2.5%) of their trillion-dollar reserves to Bitcoin, it creates massive, sustained institutional buying pressure, fundamentally increasing demand against its fixed supply. Q4: What are the biggest risks to this Bitcoin prediction? Key risks include restrictive or fragmented global cryptocurrency regulations, the successful launch of competing digital assets or CBDCs, technological limitations in scaling the Bitcoin network, and unforeseen macroeconomic or geopolitical crises. Q5: How should an investor view this 2050 Bitcoin forecast? Investors should view it as a long-term, theoretical model based on specific adoption benchmarks, not a short-term price target. It highlights a potential future state for portfolio allocation consideration, emphasizing the need for thorough personal research and risk assessment.

According to an exclusive report from CoinDesk on March 21, 2025, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter, the potential deal carries an estimated valuation between $100 million and $125 million. This move signals a pivotal strategic expansion beyond Polygon’s core layer-2 ecosystem. Polygon Acquisition Targets Physical Crypto Infrastructure The reported Polygon acquisition of Coinme represents a fascinating convergence of digital blockchain technology and physical financial infrastructure. Coinme, founded in 2014, operates one of the largest licensed Bitcoin ATM networks in the United States. Consequently, its kiosks allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin using cash or debit cards at thousands of retail locations. This potential acquisition follows a clear trend of major blockchain entities seeking to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and mainstream, real-world accessibility. Polygon Labs, the development team behind the Polygon network, has consistently focused on scaling Ethereum. Its suite of protocols, including Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM, aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions. However, acquiring Coinme would mark a decisive shift toward capturing the point-of-sale and cash-on-ramp market segment. This strategic pivot underscores the maturing crypto industry’s focus on tangible user adoption and omnichannel presence. Analyzing the Strategic Rationale Behind the Deal Industry analysts point to several compelling reasons for this potential Polygon acquisition. Firstly, it provides immediate, scaled access to a non-custodial, physical distribution network. Coinme’s extensive ATM footprint offers Polygon a direct channel to onboard new users who may not yet engage with traditional crypto exchanges. Secondly, the deal aligns with broader regulatory trends. Coinme operates as a licensed money transmitter in nearly all U.S. states, providing Polygon with a robust regulatory framework and compliance infrastructure. Furthermore, the integration could unlock novel use cases. Imagine a future where users can purchase Polygon’s native MATIC token, or any token built on its chain, directly from a physical kiosk. This scenario would dramatically simplify the user experience. The table below outlines the core strategic assets each party brings to the potential merger: Polygon’s Contribution Coinme’s Contribution High-throughput blockchain technology Nationwide physical ATM network Vibrant developer ecosystem & dApps Established regulatory licenses Strong brand recognition in Web3 Proven cash-to-crypto on-ramp solution Global user base Retail partnerships & physical footprint Expert Perspective on Market Consolidation Financial technology experts view this potential acquisition as part of a larger consolidation wave within the crypto infrastructure layer. “We are witnessing the vertical integration of the digital asset stack,” noted Dr. Anya Sharma, a fintech professor at Stanford University, in a recent publication. “Platforms that solve for scalability are now seeking to control the critical entry and exit points for capital. A Polygon acquisition of a regulated fiat gateway like Coinme is a logical step to capture more of the user journey and create a more cohesive ecosystem.” This move could pressure other layer-1 and layer-2 networks to pursue similar physical or regulatory-focused partnerships. The Impact on Crypto Accessibility and Adoption If finalized, this acquisition could have profound effects on everyday crypto adoption. Bitcoin ATMs serve as a vital, low-barrier entry point for individuals without bank accounts or those preferring cash transactions. By potentially expanding these kiosks to support the broader Polygon ecosystem, the deal could: Democratize Access: Provide easier entry to DeFi, NFTs, and other Polygon-based applications for the underbanked. Boost Utility: Enable real-world use cases like paying for services with crypto withdrawn as cash. Enhance Liquidity: Create new local liquidity pools by connecting physical cash flows to digital asset networks. Moreover, the reported $100-125 million valuation offers insight into the market’s appraisal of physical crypto infrastructure. This valuation reflects not just hardware but also the immense value of regulatory compliance and an existing user base accustomed to cash-based crypto transactions. Regulatory and Competitive Landscape Considerations Any Polygon acquisition of this magnitude inevitably faces regulatory scrutiny. Coinme’s existing money transmitter licenses (MTLs) across the U.S. are a key asset but also come with ongoing compliance obligations. Polygon, primarily a software development entity, would need to integrate these regulatory responsibilities seamlessly. Successfully navigating this integration could set a precedent for other blockchain firms seeking regulated fiat gateways. Competitively, this move positions Polygon against other companies with physical crypto footprints, such as Coin Cloud or Bitcoin Depot, as well as traditional financial service providers exploring crypto ATMs. It also creates a unique hybrid model, combining a leading digital scaling solution with a leading physical distribution network. The deal’s success may hinge on execution—specifically, how well Polygon can integrate Coinme’s operations and expand its service offerings beyond simple Bitcoin buys and sells. Conclusion The potential Polygon acquisition of Bitcoin ATM operator Coinme for up to $125 million marks a strategic inflection point in the blockchain industry’s evolution. This move transcends typical software-focused growth, targeting direct physical market penetration and enhanced regulatory standing. Ultimately, it highlights a mature strategy to capture the entire value chain from fiat entry to on-chain interaction. If completed, this acquisition could significantly accelerate mainstream cryptocurrency adoption by making blockchain assets as accessible as cash from a local kiosk, firmly anchoring Polygon’s role in building the foundational infrastructure for a more inclusive digital economy. FAQs Q1: What is Polygon acquiring? Polygon is reportedly in talks to acquire Coinme, a major operator of Bitcoin Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) across the United States. Q2: How much is the Coinme acquisition deal worth? According to sources, the potential acquisition is valued between $100 million and $125 million. Q3: Why would Polygon, a blockchain scaling company, buy a Bitcoin ATM network? The acquisition is a strategic move to bridge digital blockchain technology with physical financial infrastructure, gain regulatory licenses, and provide a direct cash-to-crypto on-ramp for mainstream users. Q4: How could this affect a regular person interested in crypto? If completed, it could allow individuals to buy not just Bitcoin but potentially Polygon-based tokens (like MATIC) directly with cash at thousands of physical locations, making crypto entry much easier. Q5: What are the main challenges for this acquisition? Key challenges include successfully integrating Coinme’s regulated financial operations into Polygon’s software-focused business and expanding the ATM network’s capabilities to support the broader Polygon ecosystem beyond Bitcoin.

Recent analysis confirms a stunning shift: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have decisively become the primary driver of BTC price movements, marking a pivotal evolution from retail-driven on-chain activity to institutional capital flows. This development, reported in March 2025, fundamentally alters how analysts and investors understand cryptocurrency valuation. Bitcoin ETF Analysis Reveals a New Market Paradigm For years, Bitcoin’s price discovery relied heavily on on-chain metrics like active addresses, transaction volume, and miner activity. However, comprehensive analysis now demonstrates that ETF fund inflows and outflows exert the dominant influence. Jim Ferraioli, Director of Cryptocurrency Research and Strategy at Charles Schwab, provided crucial context for this shift. He observed a consistent decline in on-chain activity since Bitcoin reached its peak in October 2024. Consequently, with traditional blockchain indicators waning, the market now moves almost entirely in sync with ETF capital movements. This correlation represents a maturation of the asset class. Furthermore, the data reveals several supporting factors. Transaction fees remain at multi-year lows, reducing network congestion pressure. Simultaneously, selling from long-term holders has increased, and exchange balances have hit new lows, indicating coins are moving into cold storage or ETF custodial accounts. These conditions collectively amplify the price impact of ETF flows, creating a feedback loop where institutional products dictate short-term momentum. The Mechanics of ETF-Driven Price Action Understanding this new dynamic requires examining the mechanics of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Unlike futures-based products, spot ETFs hold actual Bitcoin. When investors buy shares, the ETF issuer must purchase an equivalent amount of BTC from the open market. This creates direct, immediate buy-side pressure. Conversely, share redemptions force selling. The scale of this mechanism is substantial. Since their launch, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated billions in assets under management, representing a significant portion of daily trading volume. The transition has several clear implications: Decoupling from Traditional Crypto Metrics: Price may no longer correlate strongly with hash rate or new wallet creation. Increased Correlation with Traditional Finance: ETF flows often respond to macro factors like interest rates and equity market performance. Enhanced Market Efficiency: Large, regulated funds can absorb and execute orders with minimal slippage. Reduced Volatility from Whales: Concentrated sells by large holders are dampened by consistent institutional demand. This table illustrates the contrast between the old and new primary price drivers: Pre-ETF Primary Drivers (Pre-2024) Current Primary Driver (2025) On-chain transaction volume ETF net daily inflows/outflows Miner selling pressure Authorized Participant creation/redemption activity Exchange whale ratio Fund-level subscription data from issuers like BlackRock & Fidelity Retail sentiment on social media Institutional allocation reports and fund filings Expert Insight on the Institutional Landscape Jim Ferraioli’s analysis carries significant weight due to his position at a major traditional finance institution. His observation that “truly institutional investors have not yet fully entered the market” is particularly noteworthy. This suggests the current ETF-driven activity may stem from financial advisors, wealth platforms, and early-adopter institutions. The potential for a much larger wave of capital exists. Ferraioli specifically highlighted that clear, supportive legislation could provide the sustainable momentum needed for a major Bitcoin rally, unlocking pension funds and more conservative asset managers. Separately, Gerry O’Shea, Head of Global Market Analysis at crypto asset manager Hashdex, offered a forward-looking perspective. He predicted that catalysts to support a BTC price increase could emerge in the coming weeks. O’Shea cited potential changes in U.S. monetary policy, such as interest rate cuts, or tangible progress in comprehensive crypto legislation as key examples. These factors would likely influence price primarily through the ETF channel, as institutions adjust portfolio allocations based on changing regulatory and macroeconomic landscapes. Historical Context and Future Trajectory The rise of ETFs as the main price driver did not occur overnight. It is the culmination of a decade-long journey toward financialization. The first Bitcoin futures ETF launched in 2021, followed by the landmark approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024. This regulatory green light provided a compliant, familiar vehicle for traditional capital. The subsequent accumulation of assets under management (AUM) created a critical mass. By early 2025, daily ETF flow data became a more reliable leading indicator than many on-chain metrics. Looking ahead, this new paradigm presents both opportunities and challenges. For traders, monitoring the daily net flows of major ETFs like IBIT (iShares), FBTC (Fidelity), and GBTC (Grayscale) becomes essential. For long-term believers, the argument strengthens that Bitcoin is becoming a mainstream macro asset, albeit one whose price is increasingly set by traditional market mechanics. The decentralization ethos remains in the protocol’s design, but its price discovery is now inextricably linked to Wall Street. Conclusion The analysis is conclusive: Bitcoin ETFs now serve as the primary driver of BTC price action. This represents a monumental shift from a market powered by individual on-chain activity to one steered by institutional fund flows. While on-chain data remains vital for assessing network health and security, its direct influence on short-term price has diminished. The future trajectory of Bitcoin will increasingly hinge on factors that affect institutional capital allocation—monetary policy, regulatory clarity, and traditional risk appetite. This evolution underscores Bitcoin’s continuing integration into the global financial system, with ETFs acting as the critical bridge. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that ETFs are the primary Bitcoin price driver? It means the net inflows and outflows of capital into spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds now have a stronger and more direct correlation with BTC’s price movement than traditional cryptocurrency metrics like transaction count or miner activity. Q2: Why did this shift from on-chain activity to ETF flows happen? The shift occurred due to the massive accumulation of assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs since their approval. Their daily buying and selling requirements now represent a large portion of market volume, overwhelming other sources of supply and demand. Q3: Does this make Bitcoin more or less volatile? In the short term, it can concentrate volatility around ETF flow announcements. However, many analysts believe large, consistent institutional inflows could reduce extreme volatility over the long term by providing stable demand. Q4: How can investors track this new primary driver? Investors should monitor daily net flow data published by ETF issuers and financial data platforms. Aggregated flow data for all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is widely reported by major financial news outlets. Q5: What happens to Bitcoin’s price if ETF inflows stop or reverse? If ETF inflows stop, a major source of consistent buy-side pressure would disappear, likely leading to price consolidation or decline unless a new source of demand emerges. The market would need to find a new equilibrium.

While BTC continues to face sideways movements, short-term holders remain underwater . However, a sharp bounce above a specific level could be a game-changer for these investors. A Make-Or-Break Point For Bitcoin STHs Is Fast Approaching Following the brief bounce on Monday, Bitcoin is closing in on a pivotal price zone that could reshape the sentiment and behavior of short-term BTC holders. This objective was disclosed by Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, after examining the BTC Short-Term Holder NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss). Related Reading: Bitcoin Value Days Destroyed Reaches Lowest Point Of The Current Cycle, A Structural Calm? As the market approaches this threshold, On-chain measures indicate a change in attitude, with speculative capital starting to reevaluate risk, spending patterns shifting, and unrealized profits and losses constricting. The level signifies the zone where feeble hands may capitulate or re-enter the market with conviction. According to the platform, the Bitcoin short-term holder NUPL has started to rise again and is currently heading toward the 0 level. Such a move toward the level indicates that the holders are moving to a break-even zone and are close to lowering their unrealized losses . It is important to note that the area around the 0 level has historically served as a resistance for the short-term holder NUPL metric. However, a move into positive territory is only expected to occur if BTC breaks above and holds the $99,000 mark, which currently represents the short-term holder realized price. Until that happens, the platform highlighted that the majority of short-term holders continue to operate at a loss. Interestingly, this will keep the market sensitive to volatility spikes and defensive profit-taking, especially from the group. Whether the $99,000 level serves as a launchpad or a stress test, it is clear that Bitcoin’s path to this crucial area might completely change the near-term environment for both traders and short-term investors. BTC’s Bullish Movement Is Weak Because Of Investors’ Demand Bitcoin quickly lost its renewed bullish momentum, and several reasons have been linked to why this happened. However, one of the key reasons that stands out strongly is the demand for the flagship crypto asset. In a CryptoQuant Quicktake research , Caueconomy, a market expert and author, revealed that the demand for BTC is still weak and needs to recover. Despite the price of BTC recently rising to the $93,000 level, the expert noted that apparent on-chain demand is still low and requires a stronger comeback to sustain a return to $100,000. Currently, demand for a return to on-chain movement has not yet shown clear signs of improvement due to the market’s low trading volume and still conflicting attitude . However, Caueconomy stated that this could happen now, with the end of the holiday period, as many investors are likely to reduce trading.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|Bitcoin Apparent Demand|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder NUPL|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Caueconomy|CryptoQuant|Net Unrealized Profit/Loss,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

An additional exchange of 810,435 of its shares would earn the company total ownership. Coincheck Group, one of Japan’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced its acquisition of 3iQ Corp., a pioneering Canadian digital asset manager. The deal is structured as a stock exchange with Coincheck’s majority shareholder, Monex Group, and values 3iQ at approximately $111.8 million. Coincheck Group acquires 3iQ Monex Group agreed to exchange its 97% stake in 3iQ for 27.1 million newly issued Coincheck ordinary shares, which are valued at $4 each. Coincheck could offer similar terms and 810,435 additional shares to 3iQ’s minority shareholders and achieve 100% ownership. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2026. 3iQ was founded in 2012 and became Canada’s first regulated Digital Asset Investment Fund Manager in 2017. Its most notable achievements include launching what it promotes as North America’s first major exchange-listed Bitcoin and Ether funds on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2020. More recently, the company introduced its Ethereum staking ETF in 2023. In 2025, 3iQ expanded its offerings with one of the first Solana staking ETFs and a spot-based XRP ETF. Coincheck is on an expansion streak This deal follows Coincheck’s acquisition of Aplo SAS, a Paris-based registered crypto prime brokerage serving institutional investors, in October 2025. In March earlier the same year, Coincheck purchased Next Finance Tech Co., a staking platform services company. Coincheck’s plans include 3iQ and Aplo potentially cross-selling services to their respective institutional client bases, and Next Finance providing staking infrastructure for the project. Monex Group’s CEO Yuko Seimi said the reorganization will provide “increased opportunities for growth and success internationally” in both crypto-asset and asset and wealth management businesses, calling it a win-win for shareholders of both companies. The transaction helps Coincheck spread public company costs over a larger and more diversified revenue base. 3iQ’s established presence in Canadian and North American markets means that Coincheck gains immediate access to regulated institutional crypto investment products and infrastructure that would have taken years to build independently.

His comments matter because they challenge both crash fears and near-term bull expectations at a time when Bitcoin is trading just below key recovery levels after a volatile end to 2025. Capital Rotation Replaces the Old Bitcoin Cycle Writing on X, Ki noted that fresh capital is no longer flowing into Bitcoin in a meaningful way. Instead, money has rotated into equities and commodities, which he referred to as “stocks and shiny rocks.” He argued that this shift, combined with structural changes in the market, makes timing inflows far less useful than in earlier cycles. According to Ki, the traditional pattern where large holders sold into retail demand has weakened. Long-term institutional ownership has changed supply behavior, and he dismissed fears that major corporate holders will suddenly flood the market with coins. He pointed to Strategy’s 673,000 BTC stash , saying the firm is unlikely to sell a meaningful portion. As a result, Ki said a deep drawdown similar to prior bear markets looks unlikely. Instead of a violent drop from the all-time high, he expects what he described as “boring sideways” price action for the next few months. He added a blunt warning to traders betting on a sudden collapse: “Shorting here hoping for a nuke? Good luck with that.” Not everyone agreed. A reply from X user Inner Edition captured frustration among smaller investors, saying they were “extremely disappointed” and questioning whether a bull market would even arrive. Ki responded by urging patience, comparing Bitcoin to something that improves with time rather than quick speculation. On-chain Data Backs a Slow, Grinding Phase A recent report by analyst CryptoZeno gives context to Ki’s outlook. According to them, Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss is sitting near the 0.3 level, a zone that has often acted as a holding range between recovery and renewed risk-taking. The reading suggests average holders are back in modest profit, but nowhere near the excess seen late in past cycles. Glassnode also echoed that view in its Week On-Chain report released January 7, which described the flagship cryptocurrency entering 2026 with a “cleaner market structure” after a major reset. Profit-taking has cooled, derivatives positioning has been cleared, and spot ETF flows in the U.S. have started to turn positive again, though still uneven. However, other market watchers remain split. For example, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes that BTC’s 2026 recovery can continue if regulatory uncertainty in Washington eases and equity markets avoid a steep drop. Meanwhile, more cautious voices, such as the pseudonymous Doctor Profit, still see risks of lower prices later this year, despite a limited downside in the short term.

This preliminary move potentially signals the asset manager’s intent to pursue regulatory approval for a novel cryptocurrency investment vehicle. Consequently, market observers are analyzing the implications for Binance Coin’s institutional adoption and the evolving ETF landscape. Grayscale’s BNB ETF Registration: A Strategic First Step Grayscale Investments, a leading digital currency asset manager, has taken a formal administrative step toward launching a Binance Coin exchange-traded fund. Specifically, the company registered “Grayscale BNB Trust LLC” with the Delaware Division of Corporations. This registration, confirmed by corporate filings, represents a standard procedural action for establishing a legal entity before engaging with federal regulators. Delaware remains a preferred jurisdiction for financial entities due to its established corporate law framework and administrative efficiency. Industry analysts immediately recognized the filing’s importance. Registration typically precedes the submission of a detailed application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, this action indicates Grayscale’s exploratory phase for a BNB-focused product. The company manages the world’s largest Bitcoin trust, GBTC, which successfully converted to a spot ETF in January 2024. Following that precedent, Grayscale appears to be methodically expanding its digital asset offerings. The Regulatory Pathway for a Cryptocurrency ETF The journey from entity registration to a live BNB ETF involves navigating a complex regulatory environment. The SEC maintains stringent requirements for all exchange-traded products, particularly for assets it may classify as securities. Binance Coin’s legal status under U.S. law remains a pivotal question. The SEC’s ongoing litigation against Binance, alleging the sale of unregistered securities, directly impacts BNB’s regulatory classification. Grayscale’s strategy will likely involve demonstrating sufficient market surveillance and custody solutions. The SEC consistently emphasizes investor protection, market integrity, and the prevention of fraud and manipulation. A potential BNB ETF application would require a detailed argument addressing these concerns. For instance, the sponsor must prove the existence of a regulated market of significant size and a robust custody framework. The table below outlines key regulatory considerations for a crypto ETF. Regulatory Hurdle Description Relevance to BNB Security Classification Determining if the asset is a security under the Howey Test. Central to the SEC’s case against Binance. Market Surveillance Proof of a market resistant to manipulation. Requires data from spot and futures trading venues. Custody Arrangements Secure storage meeting SEC standards for client assets. Involves qualified custodians for the underlying BNB tokens. Liquidity & Valuation Ensuring accurate, real-time pricing and sufficient liquidity. BNB is a top-5 crypto by market cap, traded on global exchanges. Furthermore, the political and regulatory climate in 2025 will significantly influence the outcome. Recent legislative efforts and court rulings have created a more nuanced environment for digital assets. Grayscale’s own legal victory in 2023, which forced the SEC to review its Bitcoin ETF application, established an important precedent for fair treatment. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Timing Financial and legal experts provide crucial context for this development. “Entity registration is a necessary box to check, but it’s the very beginning of a marathon, not a sprint,” notes Sarah Chen, a partner at a fintech-focused law firm. “Grayscale is positioning itself in the queue. The real work involves constructing a filing that satisfies the SEC’s deep-seated concerns about non-Bitcoin crypto assets.” Market impact analysts highlight the potential effect on BNB’s perception. A spot ETF would provide a regulated, accessible channel for institutional and retail investment. This could theoretically enhance liquidity and stabilize the asset’s price over the long term. However, the immediate price reaction to the news was muted, suggesting traders are adopting a “wait-and-see” approach pending regulatory clarity. The timeline for a potential launch remains highly speculative. Following the registration, Grayscale must draft and file a 19b-4 form with the SEC and an S-1 registration statement. The SEC then initiates a formal review process, which includes public commentary periods. Historically, this process for crypto ETFs has taken many months, if not years. The approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, however, has created a new template that other asset managers may seek to follow. Delaware’s Role in Financial Innovation Grayscale’s choice of Delaware is neither accidental nor unusual. The state has cultivated a reputation as the corporate home for a majority of U.S. public companies and Fortune 500 businesses. Its Court of Chancery, a non-jury court specializing in corporate law, provides predictable and well-established legal precedents. This predictability is invaluable for financial entities structuring complex investment products. The benefits of incorporating in Delaware are multifaceted. Key advantages include: Flexible Corporate Governance: The Delaware General Corporation Law allows significant flexibility in structuring director duties, shareholder rights, and corporate bylaws. Tax Efficiency: Delaware does not impose state income tax on companies that operate outside its borders, a major benefit for holding companies and investment trusts. Administrative Speed: The state’s Division of Corporations offers expedited filing services, enabling rapid entity formation and document processing. Legal Precedent: Centuries of case law provide clarity on fiduciary duties, merger agreements, and shareholder disputes. For an investment product like a trust or ETF, these factors simplify the initial legal groundwork. They allow the sponsor to focus resources on the subsequent regulatory challenges at the federal level rather than navigating complex state-level corporate law. Conclusion Grayscale’s registration of a BNB ETF entity in Delaware marks a notable, though preliminary, step in the evolution of cryptocurrency investment products. It reflects the asset manager’s strategic planning and its confidence in the gradual maturation of digital asset markets. The path to an approved BNB ETF remains fraught with significant regulatory hurdles, primarily concerning the asset’s classification and the adequacy of market safeguards. Nevertheless, this action underscores the ongoing institutionalization of crypto assets and sets the stage for the next chapter in the complex dialogue between innovators and regulators. The market will now watch closely for Grayscale’s next move, which will likely involve a formal filing with the SEC, initiating a process that will test the boundaries of the current regulatory framework for digital assets. FAQs Q1: What does Grayscale’s Delaware registration actually mean? It means Grayscale has legally created a corporate entity, a necessary first step for launching any investment fund in the United States. It is an administrative prerequisite, not a guarantee of product launch or regulatory approval. Q2: Is a BNB ETF available to buy now? No. The registration is only a preparatory step. The ETF cannot be launched or purchased until Grayscale files a formal application with the SEC and receives explicit approval, a process that could take many months or years. Q3: Why is the SEC’s view on BNB so important for this ETF? The SEC must determine if BNB is a security. If it is classified as a security, the ETF would need to comply with much stricter regulations under the Securities Act of 1933, making approval far more complex and uncertain. Q4: How does this relate to Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF (GBTC)? Grayscale successfully converted its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. The company is likely applying the experience and legal strategies from that process to its potential BNB ETF effort. Q5: What are the main benefits of a spot BNB ETF for investors? A spot ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to BNB’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without the technical complexities of directly buying, storing, and securing the cryptocurrency themselves. It offers regulated custody and easier tax reporting.

56989040,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=891514,1767905412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56989040.jpeg,"Morgan Stanley to launch Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana trading on E*Trade and its own digital wallet in 2026",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/morgan-stanley-to-launch-crypto-wallet-this-year/,cryptopolitan,"Morgan Stanley is rolling out major changes to how it handles digital currencies, employee stock programs, and private company investments in 2026, with plans that company executives say work together as part of a single vision for the future of finance. Jed Finn, who runs wealth management at Morgan Stanley, said the bank’s various moves are connected. “It all fits together in a broader strategy of adapting to the change in the industry and in some cases driving the change in the industry,” Finn told Barron’s Advisor. The investment bank revealed last year it would team up with Zerohash, a company that builds cryptocurrency systems, to let people buy and sell Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana through E*Trade. Finn said that the feature should be ready to use in the first six months of this year. After that, Morgan Stanley plans to introduce its own digital wallet in the second six months of 2026. The bank sees this wallet as more than just a place to hold coins; it wants to eventually use it for trading all kinds of assets that exist in digital form. “This is really a recognition that the way that financial service infrastructure works is going to change,” Finn said. He explained that as the bank builds out its systems, it will be able to mix traditional banking with newer forms of digital finance. That could mean letting customers borrow money against their cryptocurrency to buy stocks, or the other way around. It might also involve making loans based on cryptocurrency that people keep in cold storage, which is a way to hold digital money offline for safety. Morgan Stanley also expanded its relationship last year with Carta, a software company that helps private businesses track who owns their stock. The deal lets Morgan Stanley offer financial planning services to workers at those companies. This builds on an agreement from 2024 that made Morgan Stanley the only firm handling shares for companies getting ready to go public. Capturing private company employees and founders The Carta deal brings together two major players in managing company ownership records. For Morgan Stanley’s wealth division, it opens doors to founders, executives, and early investors who hold big stakes in young companies. These people often have questions about getting cash from their holdings, spreading out their investments, planning for retirement, and other money matters that Morgan Stanley can help with better than Carta can. “What became clear is that if we could partner with Carta to deliver Morgan Stanley Wealth Management capabilities through the Carta platform to the individuals, we would be able to help everybody involved,” Finn said. He noted that many people involved with private companies have wealth on paper that has not yet turned into actual money. “But we’re in this for the long haul. We’re in this for 20, 30, 40 years—multiple generations.” EquityZen deal opens door to pre-IPO investing Morgan Stanley is also working to give more people access to private companies. A key part of this effort is buying EquityZen, a marketplace for trading private company shares. Morgan Stanley agreed to purchase EquityZen last year, and the deal should finish early in 2026. Getting EquityZen will let Morgan Stanley’s regular wealth customers invest in private companies and grow its business with companies that want to sell more of their stock before going public. “The average time to IPO 20 years ago was five years, and today it’s 14 years, and so all of our clients are missing out on that wealth creation,” Finn said. He explained the bank wanted to give customers access to opportunities usually limited to venture capital firms and large institutional investors. Finn said Morgan Stanley picked EquityZen over other private share exchanges because it works directly with the companies issuing stock. Other exchanges use different types of contracts that can make company leaders lose track of who controls their shares, he said. “We didn’t want to be doing anything around the companies.” The EquityZen purchase fits with the Carta partnership by strengthening Morgan Stanley’s ties to private companies with valuable stock. The bank wants to help arrange limited share sales for raising money and use its Carta connection to update ownership records. Tokenization could reshape private share trading Looking ahead, Finn sees the digital money systems Morgan Stanley is building eventually changing how private shares are sold. At first, sales on EquityZen will work the old-fashioned way. But later, private companies might turn portions of their stock into digital tokens to make trades between buyers and sellers easier. “One huge benefit is transaction efficiency for the company,” he said. “Once there’s a digital representation of that share of value for the private-market company, it can trade seamlessly and no one has to sign anything and it becomes an instantaneous settlement.” The move comes as real-world asset tokenization continues to gain traction across the financial industry, with experts predicting the market could reach trillions of dollars in the coming years.

It has been in a massive downtrend over the past several months, prompting some analysts to be quite bearish about the future. Meanwhile, certain indicators suggest a further pullback could be on the horizon. ‘Hard to Stay Bullish’ PI currently trades at approximately $0.20 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a minor 2% increase on a weekly scale and a whopping 93% collapse since the all-time high of $3 observed in February last year. X user pinetworkmembers, who has been quite critical of the project as of late, claimed it’s “hard to stay bullish” on PI at the moment. They noted that the asset had barely moved up when BTC bounced at the start of 2026, outlining several hurdles for the price. The main ones include the lack of support from a major exchange, “no real open mainnet,” unclear supply, centralized control, locked balances, and others. “At some point, you have to ask if this is innovation… or just wasted time and opportunity cost,” they added. The increased exchange supply reinforces the bearish outlook. Almost 1.8 million tokens have been transferred to centralized platforms in the past 24 hours alone, which is often considered a pre-sale step. As of now, more than 425 million PI are stored on exchanges, with roughly 52% of that amount held by Gate.io. Bitget comes in second with around 148 million coins. PI Exchange Reserves, Source: piscan.io Something for the Bulls Some analysts refuse to wave the white flag, arguing that a resurgence could be knocking on the door. X user Vuori Trading claimed that PI has been breaking out from an eight-month downtrend, predicting the price might rise to $0.57 soon. Prior to that, Aman assumed that the asset had been “consolidating tight under key resistance after trending higher.” The market observer forecasted new peaks should the valuation surge above $0.215. The upcoming token unlocks also deserve to be observed. Over 130 million PI are scheduled for release in the next 30 days, as today (January 8) is the record day, with 5.3 million coins freed up. The average daily unlock is around 4.36 million, which is less aggressive than in previous months and could provide some short-term price stability.

This innovative product, reported initially by Cointelegraph, enables qualified users to access up to $5 million in liquidity without paying annual interest or fees. The announcement arrives as institutional and retail investors increasingly seek sophisticated financial tools for their digital asset portfolios. Consequently, this development marks a significant evolution in crypto-backed lending services globally. Nexo’s Zero-Interest Credit Product Mechanics Nexo’s new offering represents a substantial departure from traditional crypto lending models. The platform allows BTC and ETH holders to borrow against their holdings at a 0% annual percentage rate. Users maintain ownership of their collateralized assets while accessing immediate liquidity. Repayment at maturity offers flexibility through multiple options. Borrowers can settle obligations using stablecoins or provide additional collateral. This structure provides unprecedented financial flexibility for cryptocurrency investors. The product’s $5 million maximum borrowing limit caters specifically to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Nexo established this threshold after extensive market research. The company identified strong demand for large-scale liquidity solutions among substantial crypto holders. Importantly, the zero-interest feature applies throughout the entire loan term. Nexo confirms the absence of hidden fees or origination charges. This transparency builds trust within the cryptocurrency community. Technical Implementation and Security Protocols Nexo implements advanced smart contract technology to facilitate these credit lines securely. The system automatically manages collateral ratios and liquidation parameters. Real-time monitoring ensures compliance with agreed terms. Borrowers receive instant notifications about their credit status. Furthermore, Nexo employs military-grade encryption for all transactions. The platform maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for digital assets. These security measures address common concerns about crypto lending platforms. Market Context and Competitive Landscape The cryptocurrency lending sector has experienced remarkable growth since 2020. Traditional finance institutions gradually entered the space throughout 2023. However, specialized platforms like Nexo continue leading innovation. The company facilitated approximately $140 million in loans during the previous year. This track record demonstrates substantial market traction. Nexo’s new zero-interest product directly responds to evolving borrower expectations. Competitive analysis reveals Nexo’s unique positioning. Most crypto lenders currently charge interest rates between 5% and 15% annually. Some platforms offer promotional zero-interest periods. However, these typically last only 30-90 days. Nexo’s permanent zero-interest structure represents a genuine market disruption. The table below illustrates key differences: Platform Interest Rate Maximum Loan Collateral Options Nexo 0% $5 million BTC, ETH Competitor A 5.9% $2 million Multiple cryptocurrencies Competitor B 8.5% $1 million BTC, ETH, stablecoins Industry experts recognize this development’s significance. Sarah Chen, fintech analyst at Digital Finance Research, explains the strategic implications. “Nexo’s move pressures traditional lenders to innovate faster,” Chen states. “Zero-interest credit lines could become standard for premium clients.” Meanwhile, institutional adoption continues accelerating. Major investment firms increasingly allocate to digital assets. Consequently, demand for sophisticated financial products grows substantially. Economic Implications and User Benefits Zero-interest credit lines offer multiple advantages for cryptocurrency holders. Investors can access liquidity without selling appreciating assets. This avoids potential tax implications in many jurisdictions. Additionally, borrowers maintain exposure to potential cryptocurrency price appreciation. The structure functions similarly to securities-based lending in traditional markets. However, crypto lending typically offers faster processing and greater accessibility. Key benefits include: Tax efficiency : Avoiding taxable events from asset sales Portfolio optimization : Maintaining investment positions while accessing cash Financial flexibility : Addressing opportunities or emergencies without liquidation Cost savings : Eliminating interest expenses entirely Real-world applications demonstrate practical utility. Consider a Bitcoin holder needing funds for business expansion. Traditional options might require selling BTC, potentially missing future gains. Alternatively, conventional loans often involve lengthy approval processes. Nexo’s solution provides immediate capital while preserving the underlying asset. This capability proves particularly valuable during market volatility. Investors can navigate downturns without forced selling. Risk Management Considerations While offering significant benefits, crypto-backed lending involves specific risks. Collateral value fluctuations represent the primary concern. Nexo addresses this through conservative loan-to-value ratios. The platform monitors positions continuously. Automated systems trigger warnings before liquidation events. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty persists in some regions. Nexo maintains compliance with applicable jurisdictions. The company conducts thorough borrower verification. These measures promote responsible lending practices. Historical Development and Future Trajectory Nexo’s innovation builds upon years of cryptocurrency lending evolution. Early platforms emerged around 2017, offering basic borrowing services. Interest rates often exceeded 20% annually initially. Market maturation gradually reduced costs. Institutional participation increased significantly after 2021. Traditional financial models began integrating with blockchain technology. Nexo’s latest development represents the next logical progression. The company’s $140 million lending volume last year demonstrates market validation. This figure represents approximately 15% year-over-year growth. Industry projections suggest continued expansion. Analysts predict crypto lending could reach $50 billion globally by 2026. Zero-interest products likely will capture substantial market share. Furthermore, integration with decentralized finance protocols appears inevitable. Hybrid models combining CeFi and DeFi elements may emerge soon. Future developments might include: Expansion to additional cryptocurrency collateral types Integration with traditional banking services Automated portfolio management features Regulatory-compliant products for specific jurisdictions Market observers anticipate increased competition following Nexo’s announcement. Other lenders probably will develop similar offerings. However, first-mover advantage provides significant benefits. Nexo establishes itself as the innovation leader in crypto lending. This positioning strengthens brand recognition and customer loyalty. The company likely will introduce complementary products soon. Conclusion Nexo’s launch of zero-interest credit lines for BTC and ETH holders represents a transformative moment for cryptocurrency finance. This innovative product provides substantial benefits for digital asset investors seeking liquidity. The $5 million maximum borrowing capacity caters to serious institutional and individual clients. Importantly, the 0% interest rate with no fees creates unprecedented value. Nexo’s proven track record, including $140 million in facilitated loans, demonstrates platform reliability. As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates globally, sophisticated financial instruments become increasingly essential. Nexo’s latest offering addresses this growing demand effectively. The product likely will influence broader crypto lending industry standards. Consequently, both retail and institutional investors should monitor this development closely. FAQs Q1: How does Nexo’s zero-interest credit line work exactly? Nexo allows qualified Bitcoin and Ethereum holders to borrow against their assets at 0% annual interest. Users can access up to $5 million in liquidity while maintaining ownership of their collateralized cryptocurrency. Repayment at maturity can be made using stablecoins or additional collateral. Q2: What are the eligibility requirements for this product? While Nexo hasn’t published detailed eligibility criteria, applicants typically need substantial BTC or ETH holdings for collateral.

56990965,https://cryptonews.com/?p=471731,1767911700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56990965.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now January 8 – XRP, Zcash, PEPE",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-january-8-xrp-zcash-pepe/,cryptonews,"It’s a fresh year for crypto, and investors are increasingly debating whether 2026 could usher in a major bull run, particularly if U.S. authorities finally roll out comprehensive, long-awaited cryptocurrency regulations. One key signal catching investors’ attention is Bitcoin’s gradual loss of market share since the summer. Historically, a decline in BTC dominance indicates people are rotating into altcoins. If that pattern holds, assets such as XRP, Zcash, and Pepe may clock new highs in the months ahead. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Eyes New Q1 Highs Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) leads the blockchain-based cross-border payments niche, thanks to rapid transaction finality and extremely low fees. Designed with banks and institutions in mind, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) offers a next-gen alternative to legacy messaging systems like SWIFT. XRP’s utility has been acknowledged in publications from bodies such as the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. Today, XRP ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency outside of stablecoins, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $127 billion. After Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission concluded last year, XRP surged to a seven-year peak of $3.65. The token has since corrected by roughly 42% and is currently changing hands at around $2.09. Momentum returned recently as XRP jumped about 14% in the last seven days. The surge is likely spurred by the debut of five spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. These products open crypto investing to traditional investors who want to avoid the risks of directly holding crypto. With further ETF approvals and clearer regulatory frameworks, analysts suggest XRP could test $5 before the end of Q1, with optimistic forecasts pointing to $10 later in the year. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Coin Veteran Delivers Explosive 700% Growth Launched in 2016, Zcash ($ZEC) remains one of the most technically advanced privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, originating as a Bitcoin fork designed to enhance transaction confidentiality. The protocol leverages zk-SNARKs, advanced zero-knowledge proofs that allow transactions to be verified without revealing sensitive details. Users can choose between transparent and shielded addresses, depending on their personal privacy and regulatory considerations. Over the past year, Zcash has climbed approximately 688%. Now priced near $400, ZEC carries a market cap of around $6.7 billion, representing more than a third of the estimated $17.5 billion privacy-coin sector. With its relative strength index (RSI) hovering near 37 and trending downward, the token is in the midst of a large selloff, having dropped 20% overnight. However, should market sentiment flip to bullish this winter, Zcash could stage a sharp rally, potentially targeting $1,000 before year-end. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Coin Energy Returns Since its debut in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has quickly become the third-largest meme coin, fueled by the enduring popularity of Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog character. With a market capitalization nearing $3 billion, PEPE has established a strong cultural presence. Interest surged further when Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed profile image on X, reigniting speculation around meme tokens. PEPE is currently trading around $0.000006848, roughly 78% below its late-2024 high of $0.00002803 after a subdued summer and slower final quarter. An RSI reading of 64, down from 76 on Tuesday, is consistent with profit-taking following a 69% rally in the seven days between December 30 and January 6. That move pushed PEPE above the critical $0.000006 support level. While near-term pullbacks are possible, consolidation remains healthy now that Pepe is back in a support zone. If broader crypto markets turn decisively bullish in 2026, Pepe could benefit disproportionately, potentially setting the stage for a new all-time high within the next quarter. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Driven Bitcoin Layer-2 Contender A lesser-known project gaining quiet traction is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 network that blends meme-style branding with serious technical ambitions. The protocol aims to deliver high-speed transactions, low fees, and smart-contract capabilities to Bitcoin. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge designed to make cross-chain Bitcoin transfers seamless. The ongoing presale has already attracted more than $30 million in funding, and some analysts speculate the token could achieve outsized returns, potentially up to 100×, once it reaches public exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit found no critical security issues, adding a layer of confidence for risk-conscious participants. HYPER tokens are used for transaction fees, governance participation, and staking incentives. Early stakers can currently earn yields of up to 38% APY, though returns are expected to taper as participation increases. With the full network launch anticipated in 2026, Bitcoin Hyper positions itself as a potential gateway for both long-time Bitcoin holders and new entrants.

56991072,https://cryptonews.com/?p=471886,1767912000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56991072.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 8 January – XRP, Bitcoin, Maxi Doge",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-8-january-xrp-bitcoin-maxi-doge/,cryptonews,"“We are so back” phase lasted for around six days before the price of Bitcoin started diving again. Crypto price predictions are once again pointing toward lower targets for BTC and XRP, while some traders are rotating into new launches like Maxi Doge. Fundamentally, all three remain as strong as ever, which is why many investors are seeing these dips as opportunities rather than panicking. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Crypto Price Prediction: Bitcoin ($BTC) Liquidating Longs Before New All-Time High? Bitcoin started the year with a massive rally from the bottom and nearly touched $95,000 before getting rejected and slipping back below $90,000. A multitude of reasons caused this dump. Trump, being the president he is, resurfaced threats of imposing tariffs on countries that trade oil with Russia. This unclear foreign policy, combined with the upcoming Friday jobs report, has caused uncertainty and led to nearly $500M in BTC ETFs outflows. Source: BTCUSD / TradingView This is not the first time Bitcoin has been rejected from this exact price point. In early December, as shown on the chart, it was rejected and later slid to $84,000. Bitcoin could follow the same path again if uncertainty continues. However, BTC is already below $90,000, and the RSI is around 35, signaling oversold conditions. Holding the $84,000 level would be key for bulls to stay optimistic and aim for a decent first quarter of 2026. Crypto Price Prediction: Ripple ($XRP) – ETF Green Streak Ends XRP’s record ETF green streak ends and records. Spot XRP ETFs saw their first net outflow in almost 2 months. $40.8M outflow has been recorded, trimming cumulative inflows to $1.2B. This outflow and market-wide uncertainty have led to stronger effects on alts. XRP is down 12% over the last couple of days and 6% in the last 24 hours. From this point, with the RSI around 40 and still leaving room for further downside, XRP could revisit the $2.00 zone. A sustained break below this level could lead to a deeper pullback toward the previous support at $1.80. If the $2.00 zone holds, a bounce toward $2.20 could happen at any time. A break above that level would likely open the door for a retest of the recent highs around $2.40 before the end of January. Crypto Price Prediction: MaxiDoge ($MAXI) Remains The Smartest Crowd Play Smart traders want to maximize their exposure to potential gains. So they choose to diversify into newer coins and presale tokens. When majors like Bitcoin and XRP are chopping and liquidating both sides, traders usually start looking for asymmetric plays. That is where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge is built for high-volatility phases like this, where uncertainty is high, and conviction is low. Instead of betting on slow ETF flows or macro headlines, it leans fully into momentum, community, and meme-driven rotations. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 70% APY through staking rewards. While BTC is flushing longs and XRP is reacting to ETF outflows, capital tends to rotate into fresh narratives. That is why many see Maxi Doge as the smarter crowd trade during market resets. Not after the move is already done. If the market stabilizes and risk appetite returns, Maxi Doge is positioned to benefit first from that shift rather than last.

The launch, seen as a bullish development for XRP price predictions , comes courtesy of Flare , a Layer-1 blockchain focused on cross-chain interoperability. Their new token, FXRP , is designed to integrate XRP into the Hyperliquid ecosystem, expanding access and utility for one of crypto’s most closely watched assets. Flare brings XRP spot trading to @HyperliquidX This listing gives XRP deeper liquidity, better price discovery, and institutional-grade execution, unlocking real onchain demand while keeping settlement anchored to XRPL.

FXRP is a wrapped version of Ripple’s native asset that is fully collateralized by XRP. Investors can redeem the token for the underlying asset at any given point on the XRP Ledger as well. Dhruv Shah, an analyst for Flare, explained that the launch is part of a move to make the token EVM-compatible. With this new token, investors will also be able to earn yield on their XRP holdings through Flare’s earnXRP program. This program offers an 8% annual percentage yield (APY), and it is available on the Flare Network. XRP Price Prediction: Fibonacci Retracement Sets Key Support at $2.03 In the past week, XRP has gone up by 12% as the crypto market bounced back strongly since the year started. Source: TradingView However, the price just hit a sell wall once it reached the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). It now seems headed to retest the $1.90 area to see if buying interest is still strong enough. The $2.03 area is the key support to watch as this coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci level. This is the lowest this pullback may go to keep the uptrend alive. If the price bounces off this mark, then XRP could soon retest the 200-day EMA. In that case, the odds of a bullish breakout will rise rapidly. In that case, a quick move to $3 will be highly likely as well. New projects like Flare tend to attract significant attention with this kind of innovation. Similarly, a top crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has raised over $30 million to launch the first real Bitcoin L2, built on Solana. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Taps on Solana’s Efficiency to Unlock BTC’s Full Potential Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a scaling protocol for the Bitcoin OG blockchain that leverages Solana’s low fees and fast transaction processing speeds to kickstart a new era for Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. BTC holders will be able to access a growing list of decentralized apps through this L2 without having to move their assets out of the Bitcoin blockchain. Investors will get the chance to earn yield, stake, and lend their BTC like never before. With top wallets and exchanges beginning to pay attention to Bitcoin Hyper , demand for its native token $HYPER is expected to climb quickly. To buy $HYPER at its discounted presale price, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up any compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL for this token or use a bank card to invest in seconds.

Particularly for high-frequency, compliance-heavy products like tokenised equities. With regulation pushing tokenization deeper into the mainstream, even capturing a tiny slice of U.S. stock market trading volumes could translate into a meaningful surge in on-chain activity, fees, and long-term demand for SOL as the utility token behind it. Solana Price Prediction: Hottest Setup in Crypto? As the bull market matures, sticky adoption of tokenised equity could bring the demand needed to finally realise a year-long descending channel. Still, stubborn multi-month resistance at $145 suggests a breakout move may not be ready just yet, particularly as momentum indicators show exhaustion. SOL USD 1-day chart, year-long descending triangle. Source: TradingView . The RSI has made a sharp reversal after hitting the 70 oversold threshold, a typical indicator of local tops. The MACD follows with a narrowing gap above the signal line. Traders should watch closely for a higher low to confirm an uptrend, keeping the historic resistance and key breakout threshold at $210 in focus. Fully realized, the pattern eyes a potential 280% move to $500 . And if Solana can become the underlying infrastructure for mainstream financial institutions, a 650% move to $1000 could be in the cards. However, the onboarding of Wall Street will likely be a slow process, making the full price impact of adoption unlikely to be realised over the near-term. Bitcoin Hyper: Solana Could Have Competition Those who chose Solana as their TradFi bet may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Just like the Ondo Layer-2 did for Ethereum, Bitcoin Hyper could bring Bitcoin into the RWA conversation. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

The analyst alluded to the falling Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin could surge soon enough, noting how this development has preceded previous XRP rallies. Analyst Predicts Huge XRP Price Rally On The Horizon In an X post, Bird predicted that the XRP price is set to record its strongest rally yet based on the breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance. This came as he noted that BTC.D dropped hard the last three times when XRP went truly parabolic, in 2018, 2021, and 2024. The 2018 run was when XRP rallied to its previous all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Why XRP Is About To Experience A Legendary Next 3 Months Bird stated that after that first XRP price ATH between 2018 and 2021, the Bitcoin dominance began to trend back up. The BTC.D then backtested the trend and rebuilt strength before eventually rolling over. Once that rollover occurred, XRP went parabolic again in 2021. A similar scenario is said to have played out in 2024, as Bitcoin’s dominance dropped sharply through the trendline, briefly breaking down and triggering the surge. The analyst noted that the move in 2024 didn’t fully commit as Bitcoin’s dominance recovered and the breakdown failed. However, the attempt was enough to send the XRP price flying, reaching all-time highs. Bird reiterated that XRP is sensitive to a breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance, even temporarily. Now, a similar move could be playing out again, which could send the XRP price to new highs. Bird stated that between 2023 and 2025, the Bitcoin dominance has trended up once more, broke down through the trend, backtested it from underneath, and is now chopping and rolling over. The analyst added that this is the same historical area where XRP has gone parabolic before, but that this time the setup is even bigger. The Altcoin Could Rally To Double Digits The analyst again alluded to the 2024 run. He stated that if a brief uncommitted breakdown in Bitcoin’s dominance was enough to send the XRP price surging, then a confirmed breakdown would be exponentially stronger. In line with this, Bird remarked that the next move is the one that sends XRP into double digits and beyond. Related Reading: Analyst Updates XRP Price Prediction: Why $16 Is Still On The Table Bird stated that the key difference is what comes next, as this next move isn’t just a fake-out or a shallow drop. Instead, it is the one where the Bitcoin dominance finally loses the trend for good and breaks down hard toward the lower boundary, around the 44 to 40% region. He added that when that happens officially, the XRP price doesn’t just run but enters true price discovery. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.14, down almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The strategy places one of the largest U.S. wealth-management firms at the center of institutional tokenization as regulatory clarity improves and investor demand expands. Industry analysts have highlighted the scope of this development, pointing to Morgan Stanley’s shift from selective crypto exposure to a fully integrated digital-asset ecosystem. BREAKING: MORGAN STANLEY IS LAUNCHING A DIGITAL CRYPTO WALLET IN 2026.

K mi to Trading Rollout Begins With Bitcoin, Ethereum And Solana Morgan Stanley confirmed that spot crypto trading will launch on its ETrade platform in the first half of 2026. The offering begins with three core assets , Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) , giving clients direct exposure through a regulated brokerage environment. The firm is partnering with Zero Hash to handle both liquidity and custody during the initial rollout. This infrastructure ensures that trading, settlement, and asset safekeeping follow institutional-grade compliance standards. For Morgan Stanley, this first phase serves as the foundation for a much larger strategic push. Jed Finn, Morgan Stanley’s head of wealth management, described the trading initiative as “the tip of the iceberg,” emphasizing that the objective is not merely to offer exposure to crypto but to build a long-term digital asset framework capable of supporting tokenization at scale. The H1 rollout positions Morgan Stanley at the forefront of legacy institutions entering regulated spot markets , an important step amid increasing demand from high-net-worth investors, family offices, and institutional funds. Proprietary Digital Wallet Launches In The Second Half Of 2026 The second phase of Morgan Stanley’s plan is arguably the most transformative: a self-custodied digital wallet built specifically for the firm’s clients, slated for launch in H2 2026. This wallet is being designed to hold not only cryptocurrencies but also tokenized securities, tokenized real estate, and tokenized private equity shares. The wallet will allow clients to manage traditional and digital assets in a single interface, shifting portfolio management toward a blended environment where blockchain technology powers settlement, liquidity, yield, and transfers. Key functions of the upcoming wallet include: Safekeeping for BTC, ETH, SOL, and future supported crypto assets Custody and management of tokenized real-world assets Faster settlement times for tokenized bonds and tokenized equities Unified management of traditional and digital portfolios Access to yield-generating digital instruments This design aligns with global trends in tokenization, where blockchain-based versions of traditional assets allow instant settlement, transparent ownership tracking, and increased liquidity for markets that traditionally move slowly. Morgan Stanley’s wallet effectively becomes the central hub for its entire digital-asset strategy. Tokenized Real-World Assets Become A Core Feature Morgan Stanley is not treating crypto purely as a speculative market. Instead, the firm is positioning blockchain as the infrastructure layer for the next generation of financial operations. Tokenized RWAs are a major part of this vision. In traditional markets, ownership transfers for bonds, real estate, or private equity can take days or weeks. Tokenization compresses these delays to minutes or seconds, allowing: real-time settlement fractional ownership improved secondary market liquidity programmable yield distributions transparent auditing By designing a wallet that can hold tokenized versions of private equity shares, real estate, bonds, and cash equivalents, Morgan Stanley is signaling that RWAs will play a critical role in future wealth-management strategies. This approach also aligns with the increasing regulatory clarity emerging in the United States, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins and updated ETF rules that outline how on-chain assets can be integrated into regulated financial products. ETF Filings Signal Deeper Institutional Commitment On January 6, 2026, Morgan Stanley filed S-1 forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot Bitcoin, spot Solana, and a spot Ethereum ETF with staking rewards. These filings make Morgan Stanley the first major U.S. bank to introduce its own branded crypto ETFs, signaling a shift from custodial partnerships toward full product ownership. Key takeaways include: The Solana ETF includes staking rewards, a first among major U.S. banks The Ethereum ETF distributes staking yields to investors The Bitcoin ETF provides regulated spot exposure within Morgan Stanley’s product suite The ETF lineup aligns directly with the assets supported on the upcoming trading platform The addition of staking rewards demonstrates a clear willingness to integrate yield-bearing blockchain features into regulated investment products, something institutional investors have long demanded. Combined with the wallet launch, these ETFs form a complete ecosystem: trade the assets, custody the assets, earn yield on the assets, and interact with tokenized representations of traditional markets. Regulatory Momentum Supports Institutional Tokenization Morgan Stanley’s progress reflects a broader shift occurring across the financial sector. Over the past year, U.S. regulatory agencies have clarified several key areas: stablecoin oversight under the GENIUS Act spot ETF frameworks for crypto assets guidance on staking within fund structures tax and reporting standards for digital asset custodians This clarity is giving institutions confidence to expand beyond exploratory pilots. Major wealth managers, pension funds, and banks are increasingly exploring tokenized financial products, validating the infrastructure Morgan Stanley is building. The firm is not merely responding to market trends , it is actively shaping them by launching end-to-end solutions designed for mainstream adoption. A Strategic Bridge Between TradFi And Blockchain Morgan Stanley’s digital asset roadmap positions the firm as a central bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-powered markets. By synchronizing direct crypto trading, in-house ETF offerings, and a proprietary digital wallet, the bank is constructing one of the most comprehensive institutional crypto frameworks in the United States.

While some analysts argue that BTC is entering a deeper corrective phase, others believe the pullback is a necessary reset before a renewed upside attempt. The current price action reflects this uncertainty, with volatility rising as buyers and sellers battle for short-term control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance While $4.7B In Sell-Side Liquidity Builds According to an analysis shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s short-term risk structure remains fragile. His short-term risk chart places BTC below the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, currently estimated near $100,200. Price is also trading beneath all major moving averages, including the 128-day, 200-day, and 365-day SMAs, reinforcing the view that the broader structure is still bearish. At current levels around $91,000, Bitcoin sits in a moderate risk zone, positioned between the STH Cost Basis and the -15% downside boundary. This positioning suggests that recent rebounds should be treated cautiously. Until BTC reclaims the STH Cost Basis, upside moves are more likely to represent technical bounces within a downward trend rather than a confirmed reversal. Conversely, a breakdown below the moderate risk boundary would signal rising downside risk and could accelerate selling pressure. As a result, the $90K–$100K range remains a critical battleground for Bitcoin’s next directional move. STH Losses Continue To Cap Bitcoin’s Upside Adler’s analysis also highlights a second critical framework: the chart tracking Bitcoin’s all-time highs alongside euphoria zones and the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) indicator. This metric measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s current market price and the average realized price of coins held by short-term investors, offering a direct view into the profitability—and behavior—of this highly reactive cohort. At present, STH MVRV sits near 0.92, well below its historical mean of roughly 1.09 and decisively under the neutral level of 1.0. In practical terms, this implies that the average short-term holder is holding an unrealized loss of about 8%. Historically, periods where STH MVRV remains below 1.0 have tended to coincide with either capitulation phases or extended consolidation ranges, rather than sustained bullish expansions. The last clear euphoria zone on this chart appeared during the all-time high update in October 2025, underscoring how far current conditions are from a speculative extreme. As long as STH MVRV remains below breakeven, short-term holders are incentivized to sell into rallies as the price approaches their cost basis. This behavior creates persistent overhead supply and reinforces structural resistance near the STH Cost Basis, close to the $100,000 level. Consequently, reclaiming that zone is not just a psychological milestone but a necessary condition for any meaningful regime shift back to a bullish market structure.

Following the failed breakout above the $94,000–$95,000 area, BTC experienced a decisive sell-off that pushed the price back toward the $85,000 zone, where buyers stepped in aggressively. This reaction marked a short-term bottom, but the subsequent rebound has so far lacked structural strength. At present, Bitcoin is trading near the $90,000–$91,000 region, a former support that has now turned into a key pivot. Price remains below the 200-day and 365-day moving averages, both of which are sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance. The 128-day moving average has also capped recent upside attempts, reinforcing the idea that the broader trend remains corrective rather than impulsively bullish. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Regime: Market Supported By Seller Exhaustion, Not Buying Surge From a structure standpoint, the chart shows a sequence of lower highs since the October peak, suggesting that sellers continue to control the macro trend. Volume expanded notably during the November–December sell-off, while the current bounce is unfolding on comparatively lighter participation. This divergence implies that the move higher may be more short-covering driven than supported by strong spot demand. Unless Bitcoin can reclaim and hold above the $94,000–$95,000 resistance zone with increasing volume, the risk of another rejection remains elevated. Failure to do so could reopen the path toward the $85,000 support, where the market would once again be forced to prove its underlying strength.

56992694,655310,1767916800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56992694.jpeg,Bitcoin Retail Investors Still Absent As Demand Remains Negative – BTC Moves Without the Crowd,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-retail-investors-absent-demand-negative/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin is struggling to maintain strength above the $90,000 level after once again failing to break through the critical $94,000 resistance zone. What initially appeared to be a recovery attempt has gradually lost momentum, leaving BTC trapped in a broad consolidation range that has persisted since late November. Each push higher has been met with selling pressure, reinforcing the idea that bulls are losing control of the short-term trend. Market sentiment remains fragile. Volatility has compressed, directional conviction is weak, and price action increasingly reflects indecision rather than accumulation. While long-term holders appear largely inactive, the absence of aggressive dip buying suggests that confidence across the broader market is still muted. This environment has created fertile ground for sharp reactions, but not yet for a sustainable trend reversal. Crucially, on-chain data shows that retail investors are still missing in action. Measures tracking retail demand indicate continued weakness, highlighting that the recent stabilization in price has not been driven by renewed participation from smaller investors. Historically, strong Bitcoin advances tend to coincide with rising retail involvement, as fresh demand reinforces upside momentum. Without that cohort returning, current price support looks increasingly vulnerable. Retail Demand Remains Absent According to data shared by Maartunn, Bitcoin’s 30-day change in Retail Investor Demand remains deeply negative, underscoring a critical weakness beneath the surface of current price action. In simple terms, the crowd has not returned to the market—at least not in a meaningful way. Retail investors historically play a crucial role in sustaining bullish trends. They provide incremental demand, amplify momentum, and often arrive after periods of consolidation or early recoveries. When retail demand is expanding, price advances tend to be more durable. The opposite is also true. A persistently negative 30-day retail demand metric signals that smaller investors are either staying on the sidelines or continuing to reduce exposure. This helps explain why Bitcoin’s recent attempts to reclaim higher levels have struggled. Without fresh retail inflows, upside moves rely almost entirely on larger players absorbing supply. That dynamic can support temporary bounces, but it often lacks the depth required for a sustained breakout. From a risk perspective, weak retail participation also increases fragility. If price rallies into resistance without new demand entering the system, it becomes more vulnerable to pullbacks triggered by profit-taking or external shocks. Until retail demand begins to recover and shift into positive territory, Bitcoin’s price action is likely to remain range-bound, with rallies facing structural headwinds rather than broad-based support. Bitcoin Consolidates Below Key Resistance Bitcoin’s lower-timeframe structure highlights a market that remains fragile despite recent recovery attempts. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is trading just below the $90,000 level after failing to sustain momentum above the $94,000–$95,000 zone earlier this month. That rejection marked a clear lower high, reinforcing the broader corrective structure that has been in place since late November. From a trend perspective, price is oscillating around its short- and medium-term moving averages, with the 50-period and 100-period averages acting as dynamic resistance rather than support. Each push higher has been met with selling pressure, suggesting that upside liquidity is still being used as an exit rather than as confirmation of renewed demand. The 200-period moving average on this timeframe remains overhead, capping rallies and defining the upper boundary of the current range. Structurally, Bitcoin is consolidating between roughly $87,000 and $92,000. This range reflects indecision rather than strength. While buyers have defended the lower boundary multiple times, the lack of follow-through above resistance signals exhaustion. Volume has also compressed compared to the November sell-off, indicating reduced participation and a lack of conviction on both sides. Unless BTC can reclaim the $92,000–$94,000 region with strong volume and hold it as support, the current move remains a corrective bounce. A breakdown below the $87,000 support would likely reopen downside risk toward deeper liquidity levels, keeping short-term risk elevated.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin demand growth|bitcoin investors|bitcoin news|Bitcoin Retail|Bitcoin Retail Demand|Bitcoin Retail Investors|btc|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In a recent video analysis, he argued that shifts in media coverage and capital flows suggest XRP is no longer being driven primarily by retail speculation, but is increasingly drawing attention from institutional participants. Coach JV pointed to recent discussions on mainstream financial television as an early indicator of this change. According to him, coverage on major networks typically follows sustained activity from professional investors rather than short-term enthusiasm from individual traders. He referenced the rapid spread of a social media post he shared highlighting such coverage, explaining that its reception reflected a broader sense among investors that XRP’s market standing is evolving. In his view, once large financial media outlets dedicate airtime to a specific digital asset, it often signals that established investors are already involved. He cited a segment from CNBC’s Power Lunch as an example, describing it as evidence that XRP is now being discussed within institutional investment circles rather than niche crypto communities. XRP The Big Money is Coming in… pic.twitter.com/sY4FypHclJ — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 7, 2026 CNBC Segment Highlights XRP’s Market Performance During the Power Lunch broadcast, host Dominic Chu described XRP as one of the strongest cryptocurrency trades for the year. He noted that the asset had delivered returns exceeding those of Bitcoin and Ether over the same period, rising more than 20% early in the year and climbing into the top tier of digital assets by market capitalization. Chu introduced CNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos to provide further context on what was driving demand. Sigalos explained that during the market downturn in the fourth quarter of 2025, a notable share of capital flowed into XRP-focused exchange-traded products. She contrasted this with Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, where fund flows often move in tandem with short-term price changes. According to Sigalos, investors viewed XRP as a less saturated position with stronger potential for percentage gains. Many entered positions during the market dip, anticipating a rebound that could outperform larger, more established cryptocurrencies. She added that those expectations were reinforced during the first trading sessions of January, when XRP posted solid gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 When the discussion turned toward underlying fundamentals, the program raised questions about XRP’s practical role compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although Coach JV did not play the entire exchange, he summarized the focus on XRP’s use in cross-border payments, which he described as a central factor behind continued institutional interest. Institutional Progress Versus Retail Sentiment Coach JV also referenced another CNBC appearance featuring Coinbase executive John D’Agostino. In that interview, D’Agostino addressed the disconnect between retail investor sentiment and institutional activity. He observed that while many individual investors have remained cautious, regulatory progress and institutional adoption have continued steadily in the background. D’Agostino suggested that this imbalance has been a source of frustration for professionals working within the industry, as advancements often go unnoticed during periods of negative market sentiment. Coach JV echoed this point, emphasizing that cryptocurrency markets are increasingly shaped by institutional strategies rather than retail-driven narratives. Coach JV’s Investment Perspective Concluding his commentary, Coach JV urged investors to prioritize discipline over emotional reactions. He cautioned against following influencer-led trends that often resurface during market rallies, arguing that such behavior rarely leads to sustainable outcomes. Instead, he advocated for an approach grounded in long-term value assessment. He explained that his strategy draws inspiration from traditional value investing principles, encouraging market participants to evaluate technology strength, adoption potential, and pricing discipline. Applying this framework to digital assets, he stated, favors projects with durable use cases rather than speculative appeal. Coach JV disclosed that XRP represents his largest personal holding, noting that he continued building his position during periods of broader market selling. According to him, that decision has had a meaningful impact on his household’s financial standing, reinforcing his conviction in the asset’s long-term prospects.

56993265,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259970,1767918311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock Bitcoin Withdrawal: Massive $146.3M Crypto Move Sparks Market Confidence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-bitcoin-ethereum-coinbase-withdrawal/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld BlackRock Bitcoin Withdrawal: Massive $146.3M Crypto Move Sparks Market Confidence In a significant development shaking cryptocurrency markets, an address presumably linked to financial giant BlackRock executed a massive $146.3 million withdrawal from Coinbase, removing 1,475 Bitcoin and 3,878 Ethereum from the exchange platform. This substantial movement, detected by blockchain analytics firm Onchain Lens over a seven-hour period, represents one of the largest single institutional crypto transactions of 2025 and signals potential strategic positioning in digital assets. Market analysts immediately interpreted this substantial outflow as a bullish indicator, since exchange withdrawals typically suggest intent for long-term holding rather than immediate selling. BlackRock Bitcoin Withdrawal Details and Market Context The blockchain data reveals precise transaction specifics. According to Onchain Lens, the address withdrew exactly 1,475 Bitcoin valued at approximately $134.23 million at transaction time. Additionally, the same entity removed 3,878 Ethereum worth roughly $12.09 million. These substantial movements occurred within a compressed seven-hour window, suggesting coordinated execution rather than gradual accumulation. Market observers noted the timing coincides with recent regulatory clarity developments in major financial jurisdictions. Historically, exchange outflows of this magnitude from institutional addresses have preceded extended holding periods. For context, similar large-scale withdrawals occurred before the 2024 Bitcoin halving event. The current transaction volume represents approximately 0.007% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply and 0.003% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. While seemingly small percentages, the absolute dollar value commands market attention. Institutional Crypto Strategy Evolution BlackRock’s deepening cryptocurrency engagement follows a clear trajectory. The firm launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in January 2024, which rapidly accumulated assets under management. Subsequent regulatory approvals enabled traditional financial institutions to allocate portions of portfolios to digital assets. This latest withdrawal potentially indicates a shift from custodial solutions to self-custody arrangements, a move that typically signals longer investment horizons. Several factors make this transaction particularly noteworthy: Transaction Size: $146.3 million represents substantial capital allocation Asset Selection: Combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum suggests diversified crypto exposure Execution Timing: Seven-hour window indicates planned operation Market Conditions: Occurs during relative price stability period Cryptocurrency Market Impact Analysis The immediate market response demonstrated measured optimism. Bitcoin’s price showed slight upward momentum following the transaction’s public reporting. Ethereum similarly experienced modest positive pressure. More significantly, the withdrawal reduced exchange reserves, potentially tightening available supply for trading. Reduced exchange liquidity often correlates with increased price volatility sensitivity to demand changes. Historical patterns provide context for interpreting this development. Previous large institutional withdrawals from exchanges have frequently preceded extended accumulation phases. The table below illustrates comparable transactions from recent years: Date Entity Amount Withdrawn Subsequent Price Action Q3 2023 Institutional Fund A $89M Bitcoin +18% over 90 days Q1 2024 Asset Manager B $112M Crypto +24% over 120 days Current BlackRock-linked $146.3M BTC/ETH To be determined Market analysts emphasize that correlation doesn’t guarantee causation. However, the psychological impact of institutional confidence often influences retail investor behavior. The reduced exchange supply could amplify effects of future buying pressure. Blockchain Analytics and Verification Process Onchain Lens, the analytics platform detecting this transaction, employs sophisticated blockchain monitoring techniques. Their methodology combines address clustering algorithms with behavioral pattern analysis. While the address hasn’t received official BlackRock confirmation, several indicators suggest institutional affiliation. The withdrawal originated from a known Coinbase institutional custody wallet, and the transaction patterns match previous BlackRock-associated movements. Blockchain transparency enables verification of several key details: Transaction Finality: All transfers confirmed on respective blockchains Address History: Previous transactions align with institutional patterns Custody Transition: Assets moved from exchange to private custody solution Timing Analysis: Execution during low-volatility trading hours Industry experts note that institutional blockchain behavior differs markedly from retail patterns. Large transactions often utilize algorithmic execution to minimize market impact. The seven-hour execution window for this withdrawal suggests careful price consideration. Regulatory Environment Considerations The current regulatory landscape significantly influences institutional crypto strategies. Recent 2025 guidelines from financial authorities have clarified digital asset custody requirements. These developments potentially explain timing of large-scale movements to private custody solutions. Additionally, tax implications differ between exchange-held and privately-custodied assets in many jurisdictions. BlackRock’s compliance framework necessitates adherence to evolving regulations. Their public filings indicate ongoing evaluation of cryptocurrency exposure limits for various funds. The firm’s risk management protocols likely informed this substantial allocation decision. Market participants will monitor subsequent regulatory disclosures for confirmation of strategy. Long-Term Holding Implications and Market Structure Exchange withdrawals of this magnitude affect market microstructure. Reduced exchange liquidity increases the market impact coefficient for large orders. This means future institutional purchases could exert greater upward price pressure. Additionally, assets in long-term custody effectively reduce circulating supply, creating potential scarcity effects over extended periods. The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly since previous cycles. Institutional participation now represents approximately 35% of daily Bitcoin volume, according to recent exchange data. This growing institutional presence changes market dynamics, potentially reducing volatility while increasing correlation with traditional financial markets. BlackRock’s substantial allocation further accelerates this institutionalization trend. Several structural implications emerge from this development: Supply Redistribution: Assets moving from liquid exchanges to illiquid custody Market Confidence: Institutional actions influence retail sentiment Infrastructure Development: Increased demand for institutional-grade custody solutions Regulatory Attention: Large transactions attract regulatory scrutiny Conclusion The substantial BlackRock Bitcoin withdrawal from Coinbase represents a significant milestone in cryptocurrency market evolution. The $146.3 million movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum from exchange to private custody signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets as long-term holdings. While address attribution requires official confirmation, transaction patterns strongly suggest institutional strategy implementation. This development potentially indicates reduced immediate selling pressure and increased long-term holding conviction. Market participants will monitor subsequent blockchain movements and regulatory disclosures for confirmation of broader institutional trends. The BlackRock Bitcoin withdrawal exemplifies accelerating institutional adoption that continues reshaping cryptocurrency market structure and dynamics. FAQs Q1: How do analysts know this address belongs to BlackRock? Blockchain analytics firms use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and behavioral clustering. While not officially confirmed, the address characteristics match previous BlackRock-associated transactions and institutional behavior patterns. Q2: Why do exchange withdrawals suggest long-term holding? Assets held on exchanges remain readily available for trading. Moving cryptocurrency to private custody requires more effort and indicates reduced intention for immediate selling, though not guaranteed. Q3: How significant is $146.3 million in cryptocurrency markets? While representing a small percentage of total market capitalization, such transactions influence market psychology and can indicate institutional strategy shifts that others might follow. Q4: What’s the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum in this context? The dual withdrawal suggests diversified cryptocurrency exposure. Bitcoin often serves as digital gold/store of value, while Ethereum enables smart contracts and decentralized applications. Q5: How might this affect cryptocurrency prices? Reduced exchange supply could amplify effects of future demand. Historically, large institutional withdrawals have correlated with subsequent price increases, though many factors influence markets.

This one-point decline from the previous day underscores a persistent climate of caution that has characterized trading activity in recent weeks. Market analysts closely track this sentiment gauge because it often precedes or confirms broader price movements, providing a psychological snapshot of the digital asset landscape. Consequently, understanding the mechanics and implications of this index becomes crucial for any informed market participant. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Dip to 27 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market psychology. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 27, therefore, places the market sentiment squarely in the ‘Fear’ category. This metric is not a simple survey; it is a composite score derived from multiple, quantifiable market data points. The index’s calculation methodology assigns specific weights to different factors, creating a balanced view of market emotion. For instance, market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and survey data each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share and relevant Google search trends each make up 10% of the calculation. This multi-faceted approach helps mitigate the noise from any single data source. Historical Context and Comparative Market Analysis To fully grasp the significance of a ’27’ reading, one must examine historical data. The index has experienced dramatic swings throughout cryptocurrency’s history. For example, it plummeted to single digits during major market capitulation events, such as the COVID-19-induced crash of March 2020. Conversely, it soared above 90 during the peak euphoria of late 2017 and late 2021. A current reading of 27, while indicating fear, is not indicative of extreme panic. It often represents a market that is cautious, potentially oversold, but not in a state of wholesale liquidation. This level of sentiment frequently coincides with consolidation phases, where prices stabilize after a decline as uncertainty lingers. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often correlate these sentiment levels with on-chain data, such as exchange inflows and holder behavior, to confirm the underlying market structure. The Impact of Volatility and Trading Volume The two largest components of the index—volatility and volume—provide direct insight into trader behavior. High volatility, especially to the downside, typically increases the fear score. Similarly, declining trading volume can signal a lack of conviction or participation, often associated with fearful or apathetic markets. In the current environment, moderated but persistent volatility, coupled with volume that fails to show sustained bullish momentum, directly contributes to the subdued index reading. Data from centralized exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols is aggregated to paint this picture. Furthermore, the dominance of Bitcoin, which comprises 10% of the index, plays a key role. When Bitcoin’s market share increases during downturns, as capital flees to perceived safety, it can further suppress the overall sentiment score for the broader altcoin market. Sentiment Indicators and Real-World Market Effects Beyond the numerical score, the ‘fear’ sentiment manifests in observable market activities. Funding rates in perpetual swap markets often turn negative or only slightly positive, showing traders are hesitant to take leveraged long positions. Additionally, the options market may show a higher demand for put options (bets on price declines) relative to calls. On-chain, the movement of coins from long-term holder wallets to exchanges may slow, indicating a ‘hodling’ mentality, but new capital inflows remain tentative. This psychological state creates a specific market dynamic. While it can suppress prices in the short term, prolonged fear phases have historically created fertile ground for accumulation by long-term investors. However, this is not a timing indicator; it merely describes the prevailing emotional environment. Market technicians warn against using sentiment as a standalone signal, instead advocating for its use alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Expert Perspectives on Navigating Fearful Markets Financial psychologists and veteran traders emphasize that sentiment extremes often present contrarian opportunities, but middling fear requires nuanced strategy. “A reading in the 20s suggests the market is risk-off, but not capitulating,” notes a market strategist from a major crypto fund. “This is often where disciplined dollar-cost averaging strategies are implemented, as emotional selling from weak hands subsides.” The key for investors is to differentiate between rational caution and irrational panic. The index helps quantify that emotion. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic interest rate policies, and institutional adoption news in 2025 continue to be primary drivers that can shift this sentiment. Therefore, while the index measures the effect, savvy market participants monitor these root causes to anticipate potential sentiment shifts before they are fully reflected in the price. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 27 provides a clear, data-backed snapshot of a cryptocurrency market operating under a cloud of caution. This sustained ‘fear’ sentiment, derived from volatility, volume, social buzz, and search trends, reflects the collective psychology of investors navigating ongoing uncertainties. Historically, such periods have served as important consolidation phases within larger market cycles. For investors, this index is a valuable tool for contextualizing price action and avoiding emotionally-driven decisions. Ultimately, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals current anxiety, its true utility lies in fostering a disciplined, long-term perspective amidst inevitable market fluctuations. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 27 mean? A score of 27 falls into the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that current market data—like volatility, trading volume, and social media sentiment—collectively reflects a cautious and anxious investor psychology, not extreme panic. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is a composite score based on six factors: volatility (25%), market volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are analyzed and normalized to a 0-100 scale. Q3: Is a ‘fear’ reading good or bad for cryptocurrency prices? It is neither inherently good nor bad. While fear can suppress prices short-term, it can also indicate a potential oversold condition. Historically, extreme fear has sometimes preceded market bottoms, but sustained moderate fear often correlates with sideways or cautiously negative trends. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is typically updated daily, based on a 24-hour rolling analysis of its underlying data components. Some data providers may also offer real-time or intraday estimates. Q5: Should I make investment decisions based solely on this index? No. Experts strongly advise against using any single indicator for investment decisions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is best used as a supplementary tool to gauge market psychology alongside fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and an assessment of broader macroeconomic factors.

This substantial Bitcoin options expiry represents one of the largest single-day expiries for the quarter, potentially influencing short-term price volatility and market structure. Data reveals a put/call ratio of 1.06 and a critical max pain price of $90,000 for Bitcoin, providing a focal point for market sentiment. Decoding the $1.88 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry Deribit, the world’s leading cryptocurrency options exchange by volume, reports the precise parameters of today’s expiry. The notional value of $1.88 billion underscores the sheer scale of capital tied to these derivative contracts. Importantly, the put/call ratio of 1.06 indicates a slight bias toward put options, which are contracts granting the right to sell. This ratio often serves as a gauge for market sentiment, with values above 1.0 sometimes interpreted as a cautiously bearish or hedging-oriented stance among traders. However, analysts consistently warn against over-interpreting single data points. Simultaneously, the concept of max pain price becomes crucial. This theoretical price, at $90,000 for Bitcoin, is the strike price at which the total value of all expiring options would cause the maximum financial loss for option holders. Market mechanics often see price gravitating toward this level as expiry approaches, a phenomenon known as ‘pinning.’ The following table compares today’s key expiry metrics for both major assets: Asset Notional Value Put/Call Ratio Max Pain Price Bitcoin (BTC) $1.88 Billion 1.06 $90,000 Ethereum (ETH) $390 Million 0.89 $3,100 Market participants now assess whether spot prices will converge toward these max pain points. Historically, large expiries like this Bitcoin options event can lead to increased volatility in the hours preceding and following settlement. Exchange operators typically manage the process through automatic exercise or assignment based on the final settlement price. Ethereum Options and Broader Market Context The concurrent expiry of $390 million in Ethereum options adds a significant layer to the day’s market dynamics. Notably, Ethereum’s put/call ratio of 0.89 suggests a relatively more bullish or call-option-heavy positioning compared to Bitcoin. Calls grant the right to buy, and a ratio below 1.0 often implies that more traders are positioned for upward price movement or are using calls for strategic portfolio insurance. Ethereum’s max pain sits at $3,100, providing a clear benchmark for its own price action. These expiries do not occur in a vacuum. They intersect with several broader market factors: Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rate expectations and traditional market flows influence crypto asset liquidity. On-Chain Activity: Bitcoin exchange reserves and network activity provide fundamental context. Regulatory Developments: Global regulatory clarity continues to shape institutional participation in derivatives markets. Furthermore, the growth of the crypto options market itself is a testament to increasing institutional sophistication. Options provide tools for hedging, income generation, and leveraged speculation. Today’s volume highlights their entrenched role in modern digital asset trading. Expert Analysis on Expiry Impact and Mechanics Seasoned derivatives traders emphasize that while notional values sound immense, the actual net dollar impact on the spot market is typically a fraction of the total. The key mechanism is the delta hedging activity conducted by large option writers, such as institutional market makers. As expiry nears, these entities adjust their underlying Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings to remain market neutral. These adjustments can create noticeable buying or selling pressure in the spot market. For instance, if the price is above the max pain level, market makers who are short gamma may need to sell spot assets to rebalance their hedges as expiry approaches, potentially pushing the price down toward max pain. The reverse is also true. This activity often peaks in the final 24 hours before settlement. Analysis from previous quarterly expiries shows that price volatility, measured by realized volatility, frequently spikes during this window before normalizing. Additionally, the post-expiry landscape matters. A large expiry can remove a significant overhang of open interest, potentially reducing a source of latent volatility and allowing the market to discover a new, cleaner price equilibrium based on spot flows and fresh derivatives positioning. Traders will immediately begin building positions for the next major expiry cycle. Historical Precedent and Trader Sentiment Examining past events provides crucial context for today’s $1.88 billion Bitcoin options expiry. Historically, quarterly expiries, which often involve the largest concentrations of open interest, have preceded periods of both heightened volatility and trend consolidation. For example, the September 2024 quarterly expiry, which involved approximately $1.5 billion in Bitcoin options, was followed by a two-week period of sideways trading before a decisive trend emerged. Current trader sentiment, as inferred from funding rates in perpetual swap markets and term structure in futures, appears mixed. Some metrics suggest cautious optimism, while others point to defensive positioning. The options market’s implied volatility surface, which shows the expected future volatility priced into different contracts, has remained elevated leading into this event, indicating that traders are pricing in the potential for significant price moves. Ultimately, the market’s reaction will depend on the interplay between the expiry mechanics and concurrent spot market flows from ETFs, macroeconomic news, and larger investor sentiment. The max pain price serves as a magnet, but it is not an immutable force. Conclusion The expiry of Bitcoin options worth $1.88 billion today represents a significant technical event for digital asset markets. With a max pain price of $90,000 and a put/call ratio indicating balanced but slightly defensive sentiment, the event will test current price levels. The simultaneous $390 million Ethereum options expiry further compounds the day’s importance for crypto derivatives. While the immediate impact may involve elevated volatility due to hedging unwinds, the longer-term effect often clears derivative overhangs, allowing fundamental factors to reassert dominance. Market participants should monitor price action around the max pain levels, but recognize that expiries are regular features of a maturing market, not deterministic price drivers. Today’s Bitcoin options expiry underscores the growing depth and complexity of cryptocurrency financial instruments. FAQs Q1: What does ‘notional value’ mean in options expiry? The notional value represents the total value of the underlying asset controlled by the expiring options contracts. For this Bitcoin options expiry, it’s $1.88 billion worth of Bitcoin, but it does not mean that amount of money will change hands; it reflects the scale of the derivatives exposure being settled. Q2: What is the ‘max pain price’ and why is it important? The max pain price is the strike price at which the total value of all expiring put and call options would cause the maximum financial loss for option buyers (and maximum gain for option sellers). It is important because market dynamics and dealer hedging can sometimes pull the spot price toward this level as expiry approaches. Q3: How does a put/call ratio above 1.0, like Bitcoin’s 1.06, get interpreted? A put/call ratio above 1.0 means more put options (bets on or hedges against price decreases) are expiring than call options (bets on price increases). It is often interpreted as a sign of cautious, bearish, or hedging-oriented sentiment, but requires context from other market indicators. Q4: Do large options expiries directly cause the market to crash or rally? Not directly. While they can increase short-term volatility due to the hedging activity of large market makers, they are not a primary fundamental driver. Expiries are a technical event that can amplify existing market movements or lead to consolidation as overhangs are cleared. Q5: What happens to the options contracts at the moment of expiry? At 8:00 a.m. UTC, options that are in-the-money (ITM) by even a small amount are typically automatically exercised or assigned by the exchange. The resulting settlement may involve the transfer of the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ethereum) or a cash payment, depending on the contract type and exchange rules.

This powerful move, recorded on April 10, 2025, represents one of the most substantial single-day gains for the metric this year, potentially heralding a new phase of investor behavior and capital flow within the digital asset ecosystem. Market analysts are now scrutinizing this data point, which compares the performance of Bitcoin against the top 100 altcoins, for clues about the next major trend. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Surge The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. Specifically, it measures the percentage of the top 100 altcoins, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, that have outperformed Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. A score of 41 indicates that 41% of these major alternative cryptocurrencies have beaten Bitcoin’s returns in that timeframe. While this remains below the 75% threshold that officially declares an “altcoin season,” the 18-point jump is noteworthy. Historically, rapid climbs in this index often precede broader market rotations where investor capital flows from Bitcoin into smaller, more speculative assets. Consequently, this movement suggests a thawing in the recent dominance of Bitcoin, which has characterized much of the early 2025 market. The Mechanics of Market Sentiment CoinMarketCap calculates this index by analyzing daily price data. The process is methodical and transparent. First, the platform identifies the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Next, it filters out assets designed for price stability, like USDT or USDC, and wrapped versions of other coins. Then, it performs a direct performance comparison against Bitcoin over the previous quarter. Finally, it publishes the resulting percentage. This data-driven approach provides a clear, quantifiable snapshot of relative strength. The recent surge to 41 points, therefore, is not based on speculation but on verifiable price action across hundreds of trading pairs on global exchanges. Historical Context and Market Cycles To appreciate the current Altcoin Season Index reading, one must examine past crypto market cycles. For instance, during the bull market of 2021, the index repeatedly breached the 75% level, leading to extended periods where altcoins dramatically outpaced Bitcoin. These phases were often characterized by explosive growth in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Conversely, during bear markets or periods of high uncertainty, the index typically falls, sometimes below 25, as investors seek the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. The move from 23 to 41 suggests a potential transition from a “risk-off” to a “risk-on” mentality among a segment of the crypto investor base. This pattern aligns with broader financial theory where capital seeks higher returns in alternative assets after a period of consolidation in the market leader. Several factors may be contributing to this shift. Increased institutional product development for altcoins, such as new Ethereum-based ETFs or regulatory clarity for specific blockchain networks, can boost confidence. Additionally, renewed development activity and protocol upgrades on major altcoin networks often attract investor attention. The table below outlines key index thresholds and their typical market implications: Index Range Market Implication 0-25 Strong Bitcoin dominance; defensive market posture. 26-50 Mixed performance; early signs of altcoin strength. 51-74 Altcoins gaining clear momentum. 75+ Official “Altcoin Season”; widespread altcoin outperformance. Expert Analysis on the Current Move Market strategists emphasize the importance of rate-of-change in the index, not just its absolute level. An 18-point gain is a significant momentum signal. According to data from previous cycles, such sharp increases often occur when Bitcoin’s price enters a consolidation phase after a strong rally. This allows capital and trader focus to disperse into other projects. Furthermore, on-chain data providers note that exchange flows for major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have shown subtle increases in accumulation patterns over the preceding weeks. This on-chain activity often serves as a leading indicator for retail and institutional interest, providing a foundational reason for the index’s rise beyond mere price speculation. Impacts on Investor Portfolios and Strategies The rising Altcoin Season Index directly impacts investment strategies. For long-term holders, it may signal a time to review portfolio allocations that may have become overly weighted toward Bitcoin during its prior dominance phase. For active traders, it highlights sectors showing relative strength. Key areas witnessing increased attention include: Layer 1 Blockchains: Competing smart contract platforms. DeFi Tokens: Governance and utility tokens within decentralized finance. AI & Data Projects: Cryptocurrencies focused on decentralized computation and data markets. However, analysts uniformly caution that a higher index also denotes increased volatility and risk. Altcoins, while offering greater potential returns, are generally more susceptible to sharp downturns than Bitcoin. Therefore, any strategy adjustment based on this metric should align with an investor’s individual risk tolerance and time horizon. The index is a tool for gauging market temperature, not a precise timing mechanism for entry or exit. Broader Ecosystem and Regulatory Considerations The movement in the Altcoin Season Index does not occur in a vacuum. It interacts with the broader financial and regulatory landscape. In 2025, regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue to evolve in major jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union. Clearer regulations, particularly for altcoins that may be classified as securities, can reduce market uncertainty and foster growth. Conversely, regulatory crackdowns can swiftly reverse sentiment. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate decisions by central banks, influence liquidity across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. A stable or easing macroeconomic environment often provides a more fertile ground for altcoin appreciation, as seen in past cycles. The Path to a Full Altcoin Season For the index to reach the hallmark 75 level, sustained capital inflow and positive price momentum across a wide array of altcoins are required. This typically involves a “narrative-driven” market where compelling stories around technology adoption, scaling solutions, or new use cases capture the market’s imagination. It also requires Bitcoin to remain stable or see modest gains, allowing altcoins to catch up and surpass its performance ratio. The current surge to 41 is a necessary first step, but history shows the path can be nonlinear, with the index often experiencing pullbacks before a final breakthrough. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s 18-point surge to 41 is a powerful and quantifiable signal of shifting sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. While not yet declaring a full altcoin season, this movement indicates a meaningful rotation of interest and capital toward alternative digital assets. Investors and observers should monitor this index alongside on-chain data, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors to understand the evolving landscape. The rise underscores the dynamic and cyclical nature of crypto markets, where leadership between Bitcoin and altcoins constantly rotates based on performance, innovation, and investor psychology. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the percentage of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins) outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A reading above 75% signals an official “altcoin season.” Q2: Why did the index jump 18 points to 41? The surge likely reflects a combination of Bitcoin price consolidation, increased investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies, and positive developments or narratives around specific altcoin projects, leading more of them to outperform Bitcoin in the short term. Q3: Does an index of 41 mean I should buy altcoins now? Not necessarily. The index is a sentiment indicator, not investment advice. It signals a changing market dynamic, but altcoins carry higher risk. Any investment should be based on personal research, risk tolerance, and portfolio strategy. Q4: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling performance data of the eligible cryptocurrencies. Q5: Has the index ever been wrong in predicting market trends? Like all market indicators, it is not infallible. It reflects past performance (90 days) and can be volatile. A single high reading does not guarantee a sustained altcoin season; it must be confirmed by sustained performance and broader market factors.

Bitcoin Has Seen A Slowdown In Realized Cap Recently In a new post on X, CrypotQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has talked about how capital inflows into Bitcoin have dried up recently. The on-chain indicator that Young Ju has cited is the “Realized Cap,” which measures the cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that the value of each token in circulation is equal to the last time that it changed hands. In short, what the Realized Cap signifies is the total amount of capital that the investors of the asset as a whole have put into the network. Changes in the metric, therefore, signify the exit or entry of capital relative to BTC. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap enjoyed sharp growth between late 2023 and late 2025, indicating that the coin was receiving continuous injections of capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounce A Bull Trap? Analyst Sees 2022-Style Bear Flag Recently, however, the uptrend in the indicator has seemingly broken, with its value facing a small net decline. In the past, bull markets have coincided with an upward trajectory in the Realized Cap, with a transition to weak inflows or net outflows leading into bearish phases. Considering that the metric’s trend is now hinting at the latter type of market conditions, it’s possible that a bearish transition might be occurring for the cryptocurrency. That said, the analyst has pointed out that the latest cycle isn’t the same as the ones from before. “Liquidity channels are more diverse now, so timing inflows is pointless,” noted Young Ju. “Institutions holding long-term killed the old whale-retail sell cycle.” Examples of demand channels that didn’t exist before include treasury companies like Strategy and investment vehicles like the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “I don’t think we’ll see a -50%+ crash from ATH like past bear markets,” said the CryptoQuant founder. “Just boring sideways for the next few months.” It now remains to be seen what trajectory Bitcoin will end up following. In some other news, on-chain demand as gauged by the Realized Cap isn’t the only one that has declined recently. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has highlighted in an X post, demand from retail investors has also been missing. In the chart, the metric shown is the 30-day percentage change in the volume associated with the retail investors, the smallest of hands on the network. This indicator has been negative lately, implying that the volume of transactions valued at less $10,000 has been declining on a monthly timeframe.

This statement, delivered during her appearance on the Bitcoin Brainstorm podcast, represents a notable shift in how institutional cryptocurrency adoption might evolve at the highest governmental levels. Wood’s analysis combines financial expertise with political observation, creating a compelling narrative about Bitcoin’s potential role in national reserves. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: Analyzing Wood’s Government Prediction Cathie Wood articulated a clear vision during her podcast appearance. She noted that while current U.S. government Bitcoin holdings primarily consist of seized assets from law enforcement operations, the initial goal involved stockpiling one million BTC. Furthermore, Wood stated it’s highly likely the government will ultimately move to buy the cryptocurrency directly. This prediction carries substantial weight given Wood’s track record in technology investment analysis and her firm’s extensive cryptocurrency research. Historical context provides important background for this prediction. The U.S. government currently holds approximately 210,000 Bitcoin seized primarily from the Silk Road marketplace and other criminal investigations. These holdings represent one of the largest institutional Bitcoin portfolios globally. However, government agencies have typically treated these assets as contraband rather than strategic reserves, with periodic auctions transferring ownership to private entities. Several factors support Wood’s prediction about Bitcoin strategic reserve development: Monetary diversification: Central banks globally have increased gold reserves as geopolitical tensions rise Technological advancement: Digital assets represent the next evolution of reserve assets Geopolitical competition: Other nations have begun exploring digital currency reserves Institutional acceptance: Major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin investment products Political Implications of Cryptocurrency Policy Cathie Wood added crucial political context to her financial prediction. She noted that cryptocurrency represents a very important political issue for President Donald Trump ahead of the midterm elections. Additionally, she suggested it could serve as a means for him to achieve productive results in the latter half of his term. This political dimension adds complexity to the Bitcoin strategic reserve discussion, connecting financial strategy with electoral politics. The political landscape surrounding cryptocurrency has evolved significantly. During the 2024 presidential campaign, both major candidates addressed digital asset regulation, though with differing approaches. President Trump’s administration has taken several notable actions regarding cryptocurrency policy since the election: Recent US Government Cryptocurrency Actions Date Action Significance January 2025 SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs Regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency investment vehicles February 2025 Treasury Department cryptocurrency guidance Clarified tax treatment and reporting requirements March 2025 Congressional hearings on digital assets Bipartisan discussions about comprehensive regulation Expert Perspectives on Government Cryptocurrency Adoption Financial analysts have responded to Wood’s prediction with varied perspectives. Some experts note that government Bitcoin acquisition would represent a natural progression from current institutional adoption patterns. Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla already hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, establishing a corporate precedent. Additionally, sovereign wealth funds in several nations have reportedly considered cryptocurrency allocations, though few have confirmed actual purchases. Other analysts express skepticism about immediate government Bitcoin purchases. They cite regulatory uncertainty, price volatility concerns, and technical implementation challenges as potential barriers. However, most agree that cryptocurrency will play some role in future monetary systems, even if the exact form remains uncertain. The debate centers on timing and methodology rather than fundamental viability. Historical Context of Strategic Reserves Strategic reserves represent a well-established concept in national economic planning. The United States maintains several strategic reserves for critical resources, most notably the Strategic Petroleum Reserve established in 1975. This reserve currently contains approximately 600 million barrels of crude oil, representing a buffer against supply disruptions. The concept expanded over decades to include materials like helium, medical supplies, and rare earth elements. Digital asset reserves would represent a natural evolution of this concept. As financial systems become increasingly digitized, nations must consider digital value storage alongside physical commodities. Several countries have already taken preliminary steps toward digital currency reserves: El Salvador: Made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and established regular purchases China: Developed central bank digital currency while restricting private cryptocurrencies European Union: Explored digital euro while monitoring cryptocurrency developments Singapore: Created regulatory frameworks for institutional cryptocurrency adoption These international developments create competitive pressure for the United States. Maintaining financial leadership may require engaging with digital assets rather than avoiding them. Wood’s prediction aligns with this strategic imperative, suggesting proactive rather than reactive engagement with cryptocurrency evolution. Market Impact and Economic Considerations Government Bitcoin purchases would significantly impact cryptocurrency markets. Even gradual accumulation could create substantial demand pressure, potentially affecting price discovery mechanisms. Additionally, regulatory clarity typically follows government participation in markets, reducing uncertainty for other institutional investors. This combination of direct demand and reduced uncertainty could accelerate institutional adoption patterns already underway. Economic considerations extend beyond market impacts. A Bitcoin strategic reserve would interact with monetary policy, potentially offering diversification benefits during currency fluctuations. Some economists suggest digital assets could serve as hedging instruments against inflation or geopolitical risks. However, others caution about volatility and correlation patterns that might limit effectiveness as traditional reserve assets. Implementation questions remain substantial. The mechanics of government Bitcoin acquisition present technical and operational challenges: Custody solutions: Secure storage for significant cryptocurrency holdings Transaction methodology: Direct purchases versus investment vehicles Valuation approaches: Accounting standards for volatile digital assets Legal frameworks: Authority for Treasury or Federal Reserve actions Conclusion Cathie Wood’s prediction about a potential Bitcoin strategic reserve represents a significant development in cryptocurrency discourse. Her analysis combines financial expertise with political insight, creating a compelling case for government engagement with digital assets. While implementation challenges remain substantial, the fundamental direction appears increasingly plausible given institutional adoption trends and geopolitical developments. The Bitcoin strategic reserve concept merits serious consideration as digital assets continue transforming global financial systems. Wood’s perspective provides valuable framework for understanding how government cryptocurrency policy might evolve in coming years. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Cathie Wood predict about government Bitcoin purchases? Cathie Wood predicted the U.S. government may eventually purchase Bitcoin directly for a strategic reserve, moving beyond current holdings of seized assets. She noted this represents a likely evolution from current cryptocurrency policy. Q2: How much Bitcoin does the U.S. government currently hold? The government holds approximately 210,000 Bitcoin seized primarily from criminal investigations, most notably the Silk Road marketplace. These assets represent contraband rather than strategic reserves in current policy. Q3: Why would the government create a Bitcoin strategic reserve? Potential reasons include monetary diversification, technological advancement positioning, geopolitical competition, and following institutional adoption patterns already established by corporations and some nations. Q4: What political factors influence cryptocurrency policy according to Wood? Wood noted cryptocurrency represents an important political issue for the Trump administration, potentially offering productive policy achievements in the latter half of the term and relevant to upcoming midterm elections. Q5: How would government Bitcoin purchases affect markets? Government accumulation could create substantial demand pressure while regulatory clarity might reduce uncertainty for other institutional investors, potentially accelerating adoption patterns and affecting price discovery mechanisms.

56994662,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=259987,1767921610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Hashrate Faces Potential Disruption as Iran’s Unrest Threatens Critical Mining Operations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/iran-protests-bitcoin-hashrate-impact/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Hashrate Faces Potential Disruption as Iran’s Unrest Threatens Critical Mining Operations TEHRAN, Iran – February 2025. Political protests and economic instability within Iran now pose a tangible, though likely temporary, threat to the global Bitcoin hashrate. This computational backbone of the world’s premier cryptocurrency network could experience a measurable dip as operational challenges mount for Iran’s significant mining sector. Consequently, this situation provides a stark real-world case study on the geographic vulnerabilities and resilience of decentralized networks. Bitcoin Hashrate and Iran’s Pivotal Mining Role The Bitcoin hashrate represents the total combined computational power securing the network. It is a critical metric for security and stability. Iran has emerged as a notable contributor, accounting for an estimated 2% to 4% of this global total. This share stems from the country’s historically low, subsidized energy costs, which attracted mining operations seeking profitability. However, this geographic concentration creates a point of potential fragility. When local conditions deteriorate, the effects can ripple outward to the broader network, demonstrating the interconnected nature of global cryptocurrency infrastructure. Mining operations in Iran do not simply power off like a light switch during civil unrest. Instead, they face a cascade of logistical and operational hurdles. These challenges inevitably degrade efficiency and output. Persistent internet throttling or shutdowns can disrupt miners’ ability to communicate with the global blockchain. Similarly, supply chain interruptions for maintenance parts and heightened physical security concerns for facilities can force scaled-back operations. This complex scenario leads to a gradual decline in contributed hashrate rather than an immediate blackout. Understanding the Root Causes: Currency Collapse and Sector Uncertainty The current protests are not occurring in a vacuum. They are expanding against a backdrop of severe economic pressure, primarily a dramatic collapse in the value of the Iranian rial. This hyperinflationary environment erodes public purchasing power and fuels widespread discontent. For Bitcoin miners, this economic turmoil creates a dual-edged sword. While the local currency’s weakness might theoretically increase the relative value of mined BTC, it also paralyzes day-to-day business operations and escalates costs for imported equipment and components. Authorities have responded to the unrest with actions that generate extreme uncertainty for the mining industry. The sector has historically operated in a regulatory gray area, facing periodic crackdowns. In times of civil tension, the government may prioritize energy for domestic needs or enact stricter internet controls, directly targeting mining activities it deems non-essential or a threat to national stability. This regulatory unpredictability makes long-term planning impossible and forces miners to adopt a cautious, defensive stance. Expert Analysis on Network Resilience and Impact Scope Blockchain analysts and network data specialists consistently note the Bitcoin network’s inherent design for resilience. A potential loss of 2-4% of the global hashrate, while noticeable, is within the range of normal daily and weekly fluctuations. The network automatically adjusts mining difficulty approximately every two weeks. Therefore, a temporary drop in total power would slightly slow block production times before a subsequent difficulty adjustment restores the 10-minute target average. The primary impacts would be short-term and probabilistic. However, the event holds significant symbolic and analytical weight. It highlights the risks of hashrate concentration in geopolitically volatile regions. Industry observers are closely monitoring metrics like: Hashrate Distribution: Shifts in the geographic sources of hashrate. Block Intervals: Temporary increases in the time between mined blocks. Mining Pool Data: Changes in the output of pools known to have operations in affected regions. This data provides a real-time gauge of the event’s severity. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights for miners and investors assessing global risk distribution. The situation underscores the importance of a geographically diversified and politically stable mining infrastructure for long-term network health. Comparative Context and Historical Precedents This is not the first time regional events have impacted global hashrate. Historical precedents offer context for understanding potential outcomes. For instance, regulatory shifts in China during 2021 led to a much more significant hashrate migration, estimated at over 50% of the network at the time. That event caused a larger and more prolonged disruption but ultimately demonstrated the network’s migratory capacity as miners relocated to other countries like the United States and Kazakhstan. Recent Events Impacting Global Bitcoin Hashrate Event Region Estimated Hashrate Impact Primary Cause Network Recovery Time China Mining Ban (2021) East Asia >50% (Migration) Government Regulation Several Months Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown (2022) Central Asia ~13% (Temporary Drop) Political Unrest Days to Weeks Iranian Protests (2025) Middle East 2-4% (Potential Drop) Political & Economic Unrest Expected to be Weeks The Iranian scenario appears less severe in scale compared to these events. The network’s proven resilience suggests it would absorb such a shock effectively. However, each event teaches a different lesson. The Iran case emphasizes how sustained domestic instability, rather than a single regulatory decree, can slowly degrade a region’s mining output through compounded inefficiencies. Conclusion The unfolding situation in Iran presents a live test of the Bitcoin network’s robustness against localized geopolitical strife. While a temporary reduction in the global Bitcoin hashrate is a plausible outcome, the network’s design anticipates and mitigates such fluctuations. The core takeaway extends beyond short-term metrics. This event critically underscores the ongoing evolution of mining geography and the persistent search for stable, low-cost energy within a decentralized system. Observing the network’s response provides invaluable data on its anti-fragility, reinforcing that while individual components may falter, the system as a whole is engineered to endure and adapt. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Bitcoin hashrate? The Bitcoin hashrate is the total estimated number of terahashes per second (TH/s) the global network is performing. It measures the combined computational power used to mine and process transactions, directly relating to the network’s security and health. Q2: Why is Iran important for Bitcoin mining? Iran has been a significant miner due to its heavily subsidized electricity prices, which make the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin highly profitable. Estimates suggest it contributes 2-4% of the global hashrate. Q3: Would a drop in Iran’s hashrate make Bitcoin less secure? A small, temporary drop would have a negligible impact on overall security. The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts its mining difficulty. A sustained, major loss of hashrate could theoretically make the network slightly more vulnerable, but the scale of the potential Iranian impact is well within the network’s capacity to handle without security compromise. Q4: How long would a hashrate impact from Iran last? Any impact would likely be temporary, lasting as long as the operational disruptions within Iran persist. Historical analogs suggest the network would stabilize within weeks, especially if the hashrate loss is on the lower end of estimates. Q5: Does this affect the price of Bitcoin? There is no direct, mechanical link between a small, temporary hashrate fluctuation and Bitcoin’s price. However, significant market sentiment can be influenced by perceptions of network stability. Any price effect would likely be indirect and driven by trader psychology rather than a fundamental change in the network’s operation.

Trump told The New York Times in an intervie w Th ursday that he has no plans to pardon Bankman-Fried. The president also ruled out pardons for music producer Sean Combs and former New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez. Bankman-Fried, often called by his initials SBF, has been locked up since August 2023 after a federal judge took away his bail ahead of his criminal trial. During the same conversation, Trump responded to questions about possible conflicts of interest involving the cryptocurrency business. The president and members of his family have ties to American Bitcoin, a company that mines Bitcoin, and World Liberty Financial, which runs the USD1 stablecoin. Trump also has his own digital token called Official Trump, currently trading at $5.36. “I got a lot of votes because I backed crypto, and I got to like it,” Trump said. A judge handed Bankman-Fried his 25-year prison term in March 2024 after a jury found him guilty on seven felony charges. Those charges related to how customer money was mishandled at FTX. Two other former executives got shorter sentences after they made deals with prosecutors. Caroline Ellison, who ran Alameda Research, and Ryan Salame, who was co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, both received less time. Some reports indicated that Bankman-Fried might have tried to get a pardon from Trump by claiming he had a “good relationship” with Republicans and getting close to conservative personalities like Tucker Carlson. On Polymarket, people betting on whether Trump would pardon SBF before 2027 only put the odds at 6%. Trump has given pardons to other people connected to the crypto world. In January, soon after he started his term, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who founded the Silk Road marketplace. Trump also surprised many in October by pardoning Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, who used to run Binance and served four months in prison. Trump later said he did not know Zhao. Legal options still open Even though a pardon from Trump is off the table, Bankman-Fried still has ways to challenge his conviction and sentence through the courts. In November, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit listened to arguments from SBF’s lawyers who want to overturn the former CEO’s conviction. As of Thursday, the court had not posted any decision to the public record, but a ruling is expected at some point. If the appeals court says no, Bankman-Fried could take one final shot by asking the Supreme Court to review his case. Caroline Ellison, who got two years in prison, is set to walk free on January 21. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show she was moved in October from a correctional facility in Danbury, Connecticut to an office in New York City that helps inmates transition back into society. Prediction market shows long odds Sean Combs, the music producer, is polling at just 8% on Kalshi after Trump explicitly said he wouldn’t pardon him. Bob Menendez isn’t doing much better, the former New Jersey senator sits at 13%, another name Trump ruled out for clemency. Roger Ver, who goes by “Bitcoin Jesus,” shows up at 18% on the market. Sam Bankman-Fried is way down at 4%. The prediction market also tracks some other big names Trump didn’t mention in Thursday’s interview. NYC Mayor Eric Adams is at 17%, Edward Snowden at 16%, and Steve Bannon at 15%. Get seen where it counts.

Early moves in the region stayed measured. Shanghai rose 0.58%, the SZSE Component added 0.36%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.40% to 26,254.50. The China A50 slipped 0.16%, showing a more cautious tone in large-caps. Investors treated crypto the same way. Prices moved in a tight band after a volatile start to the year, with positioning leaning toward a wait-and-see stance ahead of macro headlines. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $91,102, up 0.3% Ether : $3,111, down 1.3% XRP : $2.12, down 1.8% Total crypto market cap: $3.19 trillion, down 0.2% Bitcoin Rangebound As Payrolls And Rate Outlook Shape Market Tone Linh Tran, senior market analyst at XS.com, said current data leans toward a scenario in which Bitcoin consolidates with a cautiously upward bias, rather than entering a deep bearish reversal. “Bitcoin’s consolidation range for the remainder of January is likely to fluctuate between $88,000 and $95,000,” she said. Across broader markets, Japan and Australia opened higher, and South Korea lagged. Trading stayed sensitive to any clue on global growth and US rates, since payrolls could reset expectations for how quickly the Federal Reserve cuts borrowing costs. Wall Street sent a mixed signal overnight. The S&P 500 finished essentially flat on Thursday, and selling hit big technology names such as Nvidia, even as defence stocks advanced after Trump called for an enlarged $1.5 trillion military budget. Dollar Holds Firm As Risk Appetite Stays In Check Rates markets also reacted to a separate Trump remark. Treasury futures inched up and mortgage-backed securities rallied after he said he was directing the purchase of $200B of mortgage bonds. The tariff story also sat near the top of the risk calendar. The Supreme Court could decide the fate of most of Trump’s tariffs as soon as Friday, and hundreds of companies have lined up hoping to recoup a share of the billions of dollars in duties paid so far. In the background, money markets priced in at least two quarter-point Fed cuts in 2026, keeping the dollar supported and leaving risky assets trading with a tighter leash. Elsewhere, the dollar held on to gains from the prior session, oil extended its advance as investors monitored developments in Venezuela and Iran, silver pulled back further from this week’s record, and gold stayed steady. Fitch raised its US growth outlook, estimating GDP expanded 2.1% in 2025 and forecasting 2.0% growth in 2026, after incorporating economic data that arrived late following last year’s government shutdown.

Amid this churning landscape, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, has outlined three essential “checkpoints for a rally,” which he believes must be met for a lasting cryptocurrency recovery this year. Key Hurdles For Crypto Rally In the report released on January 6, Hougan highlighted the first hurdle for a sustained rally: avoiding a repeat of the catastrophic events that transpired on October 10, 2025. On that day, the market witnessed the largest liquidation event in its history, erasing approximately $19 billion in futures positions in just 24 hours. Related Reading: Did Morgan Stanley Orchestrate Bitcoin October Crash? Analysts Draw Correlations The aftermath of this event raised concerns among investors about the potential long-term health of significant market players such as hedge funds and major market makers. Many feared that these entities might need to liquidate assets to stabilize their operations, a scenario that could weigh heavily on the market. However, Hougan expressed a degree of optimism, suggesting that if any major firm were poised for a downturn, it likely would have occurred by now. He argues that investors have begun to move past the traumatic experience of October 10, contributing to the recent rally at the start of the new year. The second checkpoint outlined by Hougan is the passage of the crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, which is currently making its way through Congress with the anticipated markup scheduled for January 15. This process involves aligning various drafts from the Senate banking and agriculture committees to reach a final vote. However, NewsBTC reported on Wednesday that several hurdles remain, including differing perspectives on how to regulate decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin rewards. Legislative Framework Essential Hougan emphasized that the approval of the CLARITY Act is crucial for the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies in the United States. Without a legislative framework, Hougan stressed that the current pro-crypto stance at regulatory agencies could shift dramatically under future administrations. Bitwise’s CIO emphasized that passing the crypto market structure bill would solidify key regulatory principles into law, providing a sound foundation for ongoing growth in the crypto sector. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rapid Accumulation Suggests Sharp Upward Sweep Is Coming The final hurdle for a sustained crypto rally is maintaining stability in the broader equity market. While cryptocurrencies do not operate in lockstep with stocks, a significant downturn—such as a 20% drop in the S&P 500—could dampen enthusiasm for all risk assets, including digital currencies. Hougan also notes growing concerns about a potential artificial intelligence (AI) bubble. However, current prediction markets suggest a low probability of a recession in 2026 and an approximately 80% chance of gains for the S&P 500.

56997563,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260002,1767928511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: $125M Wiped Out in 24-Hour Market Tremor,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-liquidations-surge-market-tremor/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Liquidations Surge: $125M Wiped Out in 24-Hour Market Tremor Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant turbulence on March 15, 2025, as Bitcoin perpetual futures witnessed $125 million in forced liquidations within a single 24-hour period. This substantial liquidation event primarily affected bullish traders, with long positions constituting 81.15% of the total Bitcoin liquidations. The data reveals a broader pattern across major cryptocurrencies, providing crucial insights into current market dynamics and trader positioning. Analyzing the $125 Million Bitcoin Liquidation Event The cryptocurrency derivatives market recorded substantial forced position closures throughout the trading session. Bitcoin led this liquidation wave with $125 million in positions automatically closed by exchanges. Market analysts immediately noted the disproportionate impact on long positions, which represented over 81% of the total Bitcoin liquidations. This pattern suggests that traders holding bullish expectations faced the most significant pressure during this volatility episode. Forced liquidations occur automatically when traders’ positions lose sufficient collateral to meet maintenance margin requirements. Consequently, exchanges close these positions to prevent negative balances. The $125 million figure represents the nominal value of contracts liquidated, not necessarily direct trader losses. However, it indicates substantial market movement and potential price pressure from these automated sales. Comparative Analysis Across Major Cryptocurrencies Ethereum followed Bitcoin with $97.15 million in liquidations during the same period. Remarkably, Ethereum’s long positions accounted for 83.45% of its total liquidations, slightly exceeding Bitcoin’s long-dominated percentage. This parallel suggests a market-wide correction affecting leveraged bullish positions across multiple major assets rather than isolated Bitcoin volatility. Zcash (ZEC) demonstrated notable activity with $25.96 million liquidated, of which 70.41% originated from long positions. While smaller in absolute terms compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, ZEC’s liquidation volume represents a significant portion of its market activity. The consistent pattern across these three cryptocurrencies indicates systematic rather than idiosyncratic market forces. 24-Hour Liquidation Summary (March 15, 2025) Cryptocurrency Total Liquidations Long Position % Short Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $125.00M 81.15% 18.85% Ethereum (ETH) $97.15M 83.45% 16.55% Zcash (ZEC) $25.96M 70.41% 29.59% Understanding Perpetual Futures Mechanics Perpetual futures contracts differ from traditional futures because they lack expiration dates. Traders maintain these positions indefinitely, provided they meet margin requirements. These instruments typically include funding rate mechanisms that periodically transfer payments between long and short positions to maintain contract alignment with spot prices. Several factors contribute to liquidation events in perpetual markets: Leverage ratios : Higher leverage increases liquidation vulnerability Market volatility : Rapid price movements trigger margin calls Funding rate fluctuations : Can increase position costs unexpectedly Liquidity conditions : Thin markets exacerbate price slippage The current liquidation data suggests many traders employed significant leverage for bullish positions. When prices moved against these positions, margin requirements forced automatic closures. These liquidations then created additional selling pressure, potentially exacerbating the downward movement in a feedback loop known as a liquidation cascade. Historical Context and Market Implications Liquidation events of this magnitude typically correlate with increased market volatility and shifting sentiment. Historical data from previous market cycles shows similar patterns where extended bullish periods lead to overleveraged long positions. When market conditions change, these positions become vulnerable to forced closures. The March 2025 event follows several months of generally positive price action, suggesting some degree of complacency among leveraged traders. Market infrastructure has evolved significantly since previous major liquidation events. Exchanges now implement more sophisticated risk management systems, including: Isolated and cross-margin options Partial liquidation mechanisms Advanced price oracle systems Insurance funds for extreme scenarios These developments have reduced but not eliminated systemic risks associated with high leverage in cryptocurrency markets. The current data indicates that despite improved infrastructure, substantial liquidation events remain possible during periods of heightened volatility. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency derivatives note several important considerations regarding the recent liquidation data. First, the concentration in long positions suggests market participants generally expected upward price movement. Second, the simultaneous liquidations across multiple assets indicate correlated market movements rather than asset-specific developments. Third, the absolute dollar amounts, while substantial, represent a smaller percentage of total open interest compared to previous extreme events. Market makers and institutional participants typically monitor liquidation levels as potential support or resistance zones. When large liquidation clusters occur at specific price points, these levels often become significant for future price action. The current data provides valuable information about where leveraged positions accumulated and where they faced elimination. Risk Management Considerations for Traders The liquidation event underscores the importance of proper risk management in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. Experienced traders emphasize several key principles to mitigate liquidation risks: Conservative leverage : Using lower leverage ratios reduces liquidation probability Diversified positions : Spreading exposure across multiple assets Active monitoring : Regularly checking position health and margin levels Stop-loss orders : Implementing predefined exit points before liquidation levels Collateral quality : Using stable assets as margin to reduce volatility Exchange data shows that the majority of liquidated positions used leverage ratios between 10x and 25x. Positions with higher leverage naturally face greater vulnerability to price fluctuations. The concentration of liquidations in long positions suggests many traders underestimated downside risks or overestimated bullish momentum. Conclusion The $125 million Bitcoin liquidation event provides valuable insights into current cryptocurrency market conditions and trader behavior. The dominance of long positions in these forced closures indicates prevailing bullish sentiment among leveraged traders before the volatility episode. While substantial in absolute terms, this event represents a controlled market adjustment rather than systemic failure, thanks to improved exchange infrastructure and risk management practices. Market participants should monitor liquidation data as an important indicator of leverage levels and potential price pressure points. The Bitcoin liquidations, along with similar patterns in Ethereum and Zcash, highlight the interconnected nature of cryptocurrency derivatives markets and the importance of disciplined risk management in volatile trading environments. FAQs Q1: What causes forced liquidations in cryptocurrency markets? Forced liquidations occur when a trader’s position loses enough value that their remaining collateral cannot meet the maintenance margin requirement. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent account balances from going negative. Q2: Why were long positions disproportionately affected in this event? The data suggests most leveraged traders held bullish positions expecting price increases. When prices moved downward instead, these long positions reached their liquidation thresholds before short positions, which benefited from the price decline. Q3: How do liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Liquidations create additional selling pressure as exchanges automatically close positions. This can exacerbate downward price movements, potentially triggering further liquidations in a cascade effect, though modern exchange mechanisms aim to mitigate this. Q4: What’s the difference between perpetual and traditional futures? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate mechanisms to track spot prices, while traditional futures have set expiration dates and settle based on predetermined settlement procedures. Q5: How can traders reduce liquidation risks? Traders can use conservative leverage ratios, implement stop-loss orders, maintain adequate collateral buffers, diversify positions, and actively monitor market conditions and margin requirements.

This persistent trend, led by industry giants BlackRock and Fidelity, signals a pivotal moment of reassessment for investors in these landmark financial products. The movement underscores the volatile and evolving nature of cryptocurrency integration into mainstream portfolios. Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown of January 8 Data compiled by analyst Trader T provides a clear snapshot of the day’s activity. The outflows were not uniform across all funds, revealing distinct investor behavior. Leading the retreat was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw a substantial withdrawal of $194.64 million. Following closely was Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with an outflow of $120.52 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which converted from a closed-end fund, recorded a further $73.09 million in outflows. Other funds contributing to the negative flow included Ark Invest’s ARKB ($9.63 million) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ($7.24 million). However, the day was not entirely negative. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) managed to attract modest inflows of $2.96 million and $1.92 million, respectively, demonstrating that selective investor interest remains. ETF Ticker Provider Net Flow (Jan 8) IBIT BlackRock -$194.64M FBTC Fidelity -$120.52M GBTC Grayscale -$73.09M BITB Bitwise +$2.96M BTCW WisdomTree +$1.92M Contextualizing the Spot Bitcoin ETF Market Trend This three-day outflow pattern follows an initial period of massive accumulation after the SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Consequently, analysts are now examining several potential catalysts for the shift. Firstly, some investors may be engaging in profit-taking after a significant rally in Bitcoin’s price throughout late 2024. Secondly, macroeconomic factors, such as shifting interest rate expectations or broader equity market volatility, often influence capital flows across all asset classes, including digital assets. Furthermore, the structure of these products plays a role. For instance, Grayscale’s GBTC, which carries a higher fee than many competitors, has experienced consistent outflows as investors rotate into lower-cost alternatives. This rotation is a natural market mechanism for optimizing portfolio costs. The current trend highlights that Bitcoin ETFs, while providing crucial exposure, are not immune to traditional market forces and investor sentiment cycles. Expert Analysis on Market Dynamics and Future Implications Market strategists point to the need for a long-term perspective. “Daily flow data is important, but it’s a noisy signal,” notes a portfolio manager specializing in digital assets. “We always anticipated volatility in flows post-launch. The true test will be the net flow over quarters and years, which will indicate sustained institutional adoption.” The consecutive outflows present a reality check, emphasizing that these instruments are for risk-aware investors. The impact extends beyond the ETF issuers. Sustained outflows increase selling pressure on the underlying Bitcoin held by these trusts, potentially affecting its spot price. However, the established and regulated nature of these ETFs also provides a transparent mechanism for this price discovery, a stark contrast to the opaque markets of the past. This transparency itself is a sign of maturation for the crypto asset class. Historical Precedents and Comparative Asset Behavior Outflow cycles are not unique to cryptocurrency products. Newly launched equity ETFs or funds focused on volatile sectors often experience similar patterns of intense early interest followed by consolidation. The gold ETF (GLD), for example, faced multiple periods of outflows during its first decade despite its long-term growth trajectory. This historical context is crucial for understanding that short-term redemptions do not necessarily invalidate the fundamental investment thesis of an asset class. Key differentiators for Bitcoin ETFs include: 24/7 Underlying Market: Bitcoin trades continuously, while ETF flows are processed during market hours, creating arbitrage nuances. Regulatory Scrutiny: As new products, they operate under intense regulatory observation, which can influence investor confidence. Retail Accessibility: They have democratized access, meaning flows now reflect a broader mix of retail and institutional sentiment. Conclusion The third straight day of net outflows from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, totaling $400 million, marks a significant phase in the lifecycle of these pioneering investment vehicles. While the movements from major funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC capture attention, the simultaneous small inflows into others like Bitwise’s BITB show a diversifying market. These Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility and the sophisticated, sometimes fickle, nature of modern capital allocation. For observers and investors, the coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this is a short-term correction or the beginning of a more sustained trend in the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed by investors exceeds the value of new shares purchased. This forces the ETF issuer to sell some of the underlying Bitcoin to return cash to exiting shareholders. Q2: Why is Grayscale’s GBTC seeing consistent outflows? GBTC converted from a closed-end fund with a high management fee. Many investors who were previously locked in are now able to sell or rotate into newer, lower-fee spot Bitcoin ETF competitors, driving sustained outflows. Q3: Do ETF outflows directly cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? They can create downward pressure. To meet redemption requests, authorized participants must sell Bitcoin on the open market. However, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by many global factors, so outflows are one contributor among many. Q4: Is this outflow trend unusual for new financial products? Not at all. Many new ETFs and investment funds experience volatile flows in their early years as the market finds equilibrium, investors take profits, and portfolios are rebalanced. It is a common part of market maturation. Q5: How should a long-term investor interpret this news? A long-term investor should focus on the fundamental reasons for holding Bitcoin (e.g., as a digital store of value or hedge) and the structural importance of the ETF wrapper itself. Short-term flow data is useful for context but is often a poor guide for long-term strategy.

This sustained outflow pattern raises immediate questions about short-term sentiment toward these recently approved investment vehicles. Data from Trader T confirms a net outflow of $159.94 million on January 8th, closely following substantial withdrawals the previous day. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing the underlying causes and potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ethereum ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown The January 8th data reveals a clear hierarchy in investor exit behavior. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) bore the brunt of the selling pressure. It recorded a dominant outflow of $108.42 million. Following distantly, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) saw $31.72 million leave its fund. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust experienced a $12.90 million withdrawal. Other major issuers registered smaller movements. For instance, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) had a $4.63 million outflow. Similarly, VanEck’s Ethereum Trust (ETHV) recorded a $2.27 million withdrawal. This distribution highlights where the most concentrated investor unease currently resides. Contextualizing the ETF Launch Timeline To understand these flows, one must recall the product’s brief history. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first batch of spot Ethereum ETFs in late 2024. Trading commenced shortly thereafter in a highly anticipated market debut. Initial flows were positive as institutional and retail investors gained their first direct, regulated exposure to Ether. However, the market environment has shifted since launch. Several macroeconomic factors now influence investor decisions. These factors include fluctuating interest rate expectations and changing risk appetites across traditional finance. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Withdrawals Multiple interconnected factors likely contribute to the consecutive outflow days. First, profit-taking represents a primary technical driver. Early investors may be locking in gains after the initial post-launch price appreciation. Second, broader cryptocurrency market volatility often triggers fund flows. Recent price corrections in Bitcoin and other major altcoins create a risk-off sentiment. Third, competition from other yield-generating DeFi products might attract capital. Investors constantly compare the passive ETF structure with potentially higher returns elsewhere. Profit-Taking Activity: Early adopters securing gains after the launch rally. Macroeconomic Pressure: Rising treasury yields impacting high-growth asset valuations. Relative Value Shifts: Investors rebalancing portfolios between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Liquidity Needs: Year-end portfolio rebalancing by institutional holders creating selling pressure. Furthermore, analysts reference historical patterns from the spot Bitcoin ETF launch in early 2024. Those products also experienced volatile flow patterns in their first months. Periods of intense inflows were frequently followed by consolidation phases featuring outflows. Therefore, the current Ethereum ETF activity may reflect a normal maturation process rather than a fundamental flaw. The Impact on Ethereum’s Market Structure Spot ETF flows directly impact the underlying market mechanics for Ether. Notably, authorized participants must manage the creation and redemption of ETF shares. During net redemption periods, they sell ETH from the fund’s treasury to return cash to exiting shareholders. This process can add subtle selling pressure on centralized exchanges. However, the daily volume involved remains a small fraction of Ether’s global trading volume. Thus, the direct price impact is often more psychological than mechanical. Conversely, the transparency of these flows provides unprecedented market data. For the first time, analysts can track daily institutional sentiment toward Ethereum through regulated vehicles. This data becomes a valuable indicator for the entire digital asset class. It offers a clear window into how traditional finance allocates capital to crypto. Consequently, sustained outflows could signal a cautious institutional stance in the near term. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Viability Financial experts urge perspective when interpreting short-term flow data. “Two days of outflows do not define a product’s success,” notes a portfolio manager specializing in digital assets. “We observed similar volatility with Bitcoin ETFs before they accumulated tens of billions. The key metric is net assets under management over quarters, not days.” This view emphasizes the long-term adoption trajectory. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s ongoing network upgrades arguably matter more for ultimate success. Additionally, the fee structures of these ETFs will play a crucial role. Lower-fee products like the Grayscale Mini Trust may eventually attract flows from higher-cost competitors. This dynamic mirrors the intense fee war witnessed in the traditional ETF marketplace. Issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity compete not just on brand but on cost efficiency. Therefore, future flow patterns may shift as investors optimize for lower expense ratios. Comparative Performance Against Bitcoin ETFs A relevant analysis compares the early flow patterns of Ethereum ETFs to their Bitcoin predecessors. The first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024. Their initial weeks also showed a mix of inflows and outflows as the market found equilibrium. However, Bitcoin ETFs benefited from a massive, pent-up demand from Grayscale GBTC conversions. The Ethereum ETF landscape lacks a single dominant pre-existing vehicle of similar size. This structural difference may lead to a slower but potentially more stable accumulation phase. Spot ETF Early Flow Comparison (Illustrative) Metric Bitcoin ETF (Early 2024) Ethereum ETF (Early 2025) First Month Net Flow Highly Positive Mixed / Volatile Dominant Driver GBTC Conversion Outflows Fresh Capital Allocation Market Context Post-Bear Market Recovery Maturing Bull Market Phase Primary Investor Base Retail & Hedge Funds Broader Institutional Mix This comparison suggests different adoption curves. Ethereum ETFs might follow a more traditional financial product trajectory. Conclusion The consecutive days of Ethereum ETF outflows, totaling nearly $160 million on January 8th, present a moment for analysis rather than alarm. While BlackRock’s ETHA led the withdrawals, the movements reflect common early-stage volatility for a new asset class product. Key drivers include profit-taking, macroeconomic shifts, and portfolio rebalancing. Importantly, these regulated flows now provide transparent insight into institutional sentiment. The long-term success of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs will depend less on two-day fluctuations and more on broader adoption, competitive fees, and Ethereum’s underlying network growth. Observers should monitor weekly and monthly net flow trends for a clearer picture of enduring demand. FAQs Q1: What caused the Ethereum ETF outflows? The outflows likely stem from a combination of profit-taking by early investors, broader cryptocurrency market volatility, and institutional portfolio rebalancing at the start of the year. Q2: Is BlackRock’s ETHA ETF underperforming? Based on a single day’s flow data, ETHA saw the largest outflow. However, assessing an ETF’s performance requires analyzing net assets over months, not isolated daily movements. Q3: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? The direct mechanical impact is typically minimal relative to total market volume. However, large, sustained outflows can influence market sentiment and contribute to indirect selling pressure. Q4: Is this pattern normal for a new ETF? Yes, new exchange-traded funds, especially in novel asset classes, often experience volatile inflow and outflow patterns as the market discovers equilibrium and liquidity. Q5: Should investors be worried about these outflows? Short-term flows are a common metric but not a sole indicator of health. Investors should focus on the product’s long-term viability, fee structure, and how it fits their investment strategy.

Crypto Market Has Seen Liquidations Of More Than $462 Million According to data from CoinGlass, a notable amount of liquidations have occurred in the crypto derivatives market over the past day. “Liquidation” refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has amassed losses of a certain percentage specified by the platform. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Expects Boring Bitcoin Action, Not Major Crash A mass amount of simultaneous liquidations can occur when the asset’s price observes a sharp price swing, not allowing investors the time to close their positions. The risk of this happening can increase depending on how much leverage traders are opting for. The trigger for the derivatives flush in the past day has been a downward move across tokens in the digital asset sector, which took Bitcoin to a low under $89,600. Below is a table that shows the numbers involved in this liquidation event. In total, the crypto market has witnessed over $462 million in liquidations during the last 24 hours, with longs dominating most of the flush. More specifically, bullish bets made up for $418 million of the positions involved, representing more than 90% of the total. The large amount of liquidations could indicate that the recovery in Bitcoin above $94,000 lured traders into opening fresh longs, which then ended up getting caught out by the price plunge. In terms of the symbols, the largest contributor to the liquidation event has been BTC with $132 million in positions involved, while Ethereum hasn’t been too far behind with a flush of $116 million. Interestingly, while the top two have been predictable, the third place hasn’t been occupied by the usual suspects this time. As the above heatmap displays, contracts related to Zcash (ZEC) have been caught up in liquidations of $24 million. The asset managing higher liquidations than the likes of XRP and Solana could be down to the fact that it has seen a notably sharper drop over the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounce A Bull Trap? Analyst Sees 2022-Style Bear Flag The latest liquidation squeeze has come as the futures market has been witnessing a re-expansion of Open Interest, as highlighted by Glassnode in its latest weekly report. The bearish price action between October and November had caused a massive amount of liquidations and forced traders to pull back on risk, resulting in the Open Interest taking a significant hit. Recently, the metric has seen a turnaround, implying investors have gradually been building up positions again. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $89,500, down 2% over the past day.

56998733,655486,1767931244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56998733.jpeg,Florida Lawmakers Revive Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Efforts With New Proposal,https://bitcoinist.com/florida-revive-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-proposal/,bitcoinist,"A Florida lawmaker is attempting to revive the state’s previous efforts to establish and manage a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to protect its residents against inflation and enhance economic security. A New Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal On Wednesday, Florida House of Representatives member John Snyder introduced House Bill 1039 (HB 1039) to create and administer a state-run Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve focused on Bitcoin (BTC). According to the legislation, the strategic reserve would be established as “a special fund outside the State Treasury” to serve “hedge against inflation and economic volatility” and the “public purpose of providing enhanced financial security to residents of this state.” Notably, the bill states that “to be eligible to be purchased for the reserve, a cryptocurrency must have an average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over the most recent 24-month period.” Under this condition, only Bitcoin, with its $1 trillion market capitalization, meets the requirements. Based on this, Florida’s reserve would consist of “money transferred or deposited to the credit of the reserve by legislative appropriation, (…) Revenue that the Legislature by general law dedicates for deposit to the credit of the reserve, (…) Cryptocurrency purchased using money in or received by the reserve, (…) Investment earnings and interest or rewards earned on assets in the reserve.” In addition, the reserve would be custodied and managed by Florida’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who will be able to “acquire, exchange, sell, supervise, manage or retain any kind of investments” that a prudent investor would manage, under “the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances then prevailing for the reserve.” The CFO would be allowed to establish contracts with one or more third-party entities for the administration and management of the reserve, including technology providers for a secure custody solution, a qualified custodian, and liquidity providers that facilitate the purchase and sales of the reserve’s assets. Moreover, HB 1039 would launch the “Florida Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve Advisory Committee” within the Department of Financial Affairs. The committee would be composed of five members, including the CFO, who would serve as the chairman, and four other individuals appointed by the CFO. Florida’s SBR Push Representative Snyder’s proposal follows previous attempts to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in Florida. Over the past year, some lawmakers joined the global SBR momentum and introduced multiple bills to create and manage a state-run crypto reserve. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) proposed the state’s first Bitcoin Reserve at the end of 2024, seeking to allocate a small percentage of its $185.7 billion pension fund to BTC. Samuel Armes, head of the FBBA, suggested that the state could use 1% of its pension fund, around $1.85 billion, to invest in Bitcoin as part of Florida’s push to launch a crypto-based strategic reserve. In February 2025, Senator Joe Gruters introduced Senate Bill 550 (SB 550) to allow the state’s CFO to invest up to 10% of public funds in the flagship crypto. Similarly, Representative Webster Barnaby introduced House Bill 487 (HB 487) in April 2025 to allow Florida’s CFO and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain state funds in Bitcoin, as a strategy to protect against inflation and enhance economic security. Nonetheless, both bills died in the first half of the year after failing to obtain a majority vote in their respective committee hearings. Last October, Representative Barnaby filed House Bill 183 (HB 183) with a revised and “more flexible” text to revive Florida’s SBR efforts. If HB 1039 passes the state’s Senate and House votes and is signed into law, Florida would join Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas as the few states to have enacted a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.",Crypto News|Arizona crypto bill|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bill|Crypto legislation|Florida crypto bill|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Florida|Texas crypto bill|US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

According to David Duong , Global Head of Investment Research at Coinbase, quantum computing presents two specific pathways that could eventually compromise Bitcoin’s cryptographic security. While the risk is not immediate, Duong warns that investor timelines for quantum readiness are shortening, forcing markets to consider long-dated downside scenarios that were previously ignored. The discussion has already reached institutional levels, with BlackRock flagging quantum risk in a May 2025 amendment to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) prospectus. Coinbase Flags Two Quantum Attack Vectors on Bitcoin Duong’s analysis, published by Coinbase, centers on a hypothetical “Q-day” when cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) could run Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms efficiently enough to weaken existing encryption standards. Bitcoin relies on two core systems: ECDSA for transaction signatures SHA-256 for proof-of-work mining According to Coinbase, signature compromise is the primary concern, not quantum mining. While quantum-accelerated mining faces scaling limits, breaking ECDSA could allow attackers to derive private keys from exposed public keys, enabling unauthorized transfers. 6.51 Million BTC Already Exposed On-Chain Coinbase estimates that 6.51 million BTC, or 32.7% of total supply, is currently vulnerable to long-range quantum attacks due to address reuse and legacy script types. These include: Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) Bare multisig (P2MS) Certain Taproot (P2TR) outputs Satoshi-era coins represent a known subset of this exposure. In addition, every Bitcoin transaction faces short-range risk at the moment of spending, when public keys briefly appear in the mempool. While exploitation probability remains low today, Coinbase argues this risk profile makes post-quantum migration unavoidable. Governments Target 2035 as Crypto Migration Deadline US and EU agencies have already instructed critical infrastructure providers to transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by 2035, according to public policy guidance. Bitcoin developers and research groups such as Chaincode Labs are evaluating similar timelines. Chaincode outlines two possible scenarios: A rapid quantum breakthrough, forcing migration within two years A gradual transition, allowing upgrades over five to seven years Potential solutions include quantum-resistant signature schemes such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium and SPHINCS+, likely introduced via soft forks to preserve network continuity. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triple Top Meets Fibonacci Support as BTC Nears Breakout Point On the daily chart, Bitcoin price prediction has turned bearish as BTC is consolidating below $94,100, where a triple top pattern has formed. This level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the decline from $107,700, reinforcing supply pressure. Price remains supported by a rising trendline from November, with the 38.2% retracement near $90,900 acting as a key pivot. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick structure shows small bodies and frequent wicks, signaling indecision rather than distribution. RSI has cooled toward neutral, suggesting momentum reset rather than trend failure. As long as Bitcoin holds higher lows above $86,900, the broader structure remains constructive. A sustained break above $92,000–$94,100 would reopen upside toward $100,000, with the prior high near $107,000 back in focus. For markets, the message is clear: quantum risk is not a zero-day threat, but it is now a priced-in, long-dated variable shaping Bitcoin’s evolution, custody models, and valuation frameworks as the asset matures. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000277, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Despite this, an analyst suggests that the leading memecoin is preparing to reclaim a key resistance level lost during the Q4 2025 pullbacks. Related Reading: XRP Named The ‘New Cryptocurrency Darling’ After Strong Start Of The Year Dogecoin Q1 Momentum Builds Dogecoin has seen a remarkable start to the year, recording a 21% jump from its yearly opening price of $0.117. Amid the recent market recovery, the cryptocurrency reclaimed a crucial price area and hit an eight-week high of $0.156 this Tuesday. Notably, the largest memecoin by market capitalization had retraced more than 50% from its Q2 2025 highs and was in a downtrend until last week’s price breakout. Amid this performance, market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted a pair of Tweezer candlesticks on the monthly chart, which could suggest a bullish reversal is taking place. DOGE “has nearly recovered last month’s losses in just 8 days,” he explained, which signals that “clearly, bullish momentum is building up.” Notably, the analyst recently noted that DOGE has broken out of a bullish pattern, “showing strong upward momentum.” According to the chart, the cryptocurrency displayed a three-month falling wedge in the three-day chart. Following the recent price surge, Dogecoin was able to breach the pattern’s upper boundary, signaling an initial jump to the $0.140-$0.150 area. The trader highlighted that the memecoin displayed a similar performance during his 2024 rally, moving within a multi-month falling wedge before breaking out and kicking off a remarkable performance. If DOGE repeats its previous performance, the price could retrace briefly to retest the breakout area as support before the next major surge, the market watcher added. He also pointed out that after breaking out of the daily trendline, the cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish pennant in the one-day chart. A breakout from this pattern would lead to a 40% move toward the $0.20 area, lost during the early Q4 pullbacks. However, DOGE’s price needs to close the day above the $0.142 area to hold the formation. DOGE’s Rally In Danger? Despite the bullish outlooks, analyst Ali Martinez affirmed that Dogecoin is “hanging by a thread.” In a Thursday post, the market watcher emphasized that the cryptocurrency is trading within a crucial support zone between the local lows of $0.118 and the recent highs. If the memecoin’s momentum doesn’t hold and the price loses this key zone, it could risk a more than 40% retrace. According to the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric cited by Martinez, the next major support is around $0.073, where over 28 billion DOGE tokens were previously exchanged. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $93,500 Reclaim Holds The Key For Next Move The analyst has recently pointed out that cryptocurrency’s price is seemingly on track to retest the $0.08 level after breaking out of a multi-year ascending channel. The chart shows that Dogecoin traded within an ascending channel on the three-day chart since 2023. However, the late 2025 corrections saw the memecoin lose the lower boundary of the ascending channel, potentially painting a concerning picture for its price if long-term bearish momentum continues. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.142, a 14.55 increase in the weekly timeframe.

Although Trump previously granted pardons to people connected to the crypto sector, his comments make clear that Bankman-Fried’s conviction and sentence place him outside the scope of any such consideration. No Pardon Coming for SBF US President Donald Trump indicated that he does not plan to grant a presidential pardon to Sam Bankman-Fried, the former crypto executive serving a 25-year federal prison sentence for his role in the collapse of the now-defunct exchange FTX. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Trump said he had no intention of pardoning Bankman-Fried, and grouped him with other high-profile people he has no plans to grant clemency to, including music producer Sean Combs and former New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez. Bankman-Fried has been incarcerated since August of 2023, when a federal judge revoked his bail ahead of his criminal trial. He was ultimately sentenced in March 2024 after being convicted on seven felony counts related to the misuse of billions of dollars in customer funds. This case quickly became one of the biggest criminal prosecutions in the history of the crypto industry. Sam Bankman-Fried While Bankman-Fried received a lengthy sentence, other executives involved in the FTX collapse secured reduced prison terms after cooperating with prosecutors. Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison was sentenced to two years, while former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame also received a shorter sentence as part of a plea agreement. During the same interview, Trump addressed questions about his own ties to the cryptocurrency sector, and pushed back against suggestions of conflicts of interest. He acknowledged that his pro-crypto stance helped him politically and said that he has grown more favorable toward the industry. Trump and his family have links to several crypto-related ventures, including the Bitcoin mining firm American Bitcoin and World Liberty Financial, the platform behind the USD1 stablecoin. Since his conviction, reports have suggested that Bankman-Fried tried to position himself for a possible pardon by pointing out his alleged Republican ties and engaging with conservative media figures like Tucker Carlson. Despite this, betting markets on Polymarket assigned only a small probability that Trump would pardon him before 2027. Trump has previously exercised his pardon power in cases connected to the crypto world, including granting clemency to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, and pardoning former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who served a four-month sentence. However, Trump’s comments make clear that Bankman-Fried is not expected to receive similar treatment.",News|Crypto,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Speaking on the Bitcoin Brainstorm podcast, Wood, one of the most prominent proponents of Bitcoin among mainstream investors, reiterated her belief that the federal government will eventually start actively buying Bitcoin to build out a reserve that, under previous executive direction, was envisioned to hold up to one million Bitcoins. She commented, “It seems as though there has been reticence about actually buying Bitcoin for the strategy reserve. So far, it’s confiscated [bitcoins]. The original intent was to own 1 million bitcoins, so I actually think they will start buying.” The idea of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was made official in the first quarter of 2025 through an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. Among the U.S. Treasury’s holdings are roughly 198,000 BTC from criminal seizures, making it one of the largest publicly held crypto assets ever held by a government. Yet no market purchases have taken place in the meantime; the existing holdings are exclusively of assets seized in law enforcement action. Wood’s comments seem to signal that these holdings are only a beginning. Wood believes Trump sees digital assets as a path forward The ARK Invest executive insisted that President Trump is unlikely to ease off on crypto in 2026 as he nears the midpoint of his second term. She explained that Trump is likely to back crypto given his family’s increasing financial exposure to the sector. She also claimed the crypto community played a role in his election victory, adding, “The most important one is that he doesn’t want to be a lame duck. He wants to have another one or two productive years, and I think he sees crypto as a path to the future.” In the last US election, the crypto industry emerged as an important partisan force to reckon with. Besides campaign donations from political action committees like Stand With Crypto, several prominent executives, including Wood, backed Trump personally and contributed to his reelection. Even after Trump’s triumph, some industry players continued to pitch in to advise the administration. Moreover, the White House has organised crypto events, receiving backing from Coinbase, Tether, and Ripple for the new ballroom. The president also signed two executive orders to create crypto reserves and formed a working group, led by Special Advisor David Sacks. In July, the group led by Sacks even put forward several policy ideas, including expanding the CFTC’s authority over spot trading in non-security digital assets. Back then, it was also noted that the Treasury Department would oversee both the Bitcoin reserve and the crypto stockpile, relying exclusively on forfeited digital assets. However, it also charged the Treasury and Commerce Departments to consider budget-neutral approaches to buying more BTC, but so far, none have been bought. Valente believes new market players could mitigate crypto market volatility Looking back at 2025, on the Bitcoin Brainstorm podcast, Wood and ARK’s Lorenzo Valente also noted that the crypto market experienced volatility and flash crashes. However, Valente added that new entrants are serious players whose long-term strategies could help stabilise the market. Similarly, Wood also claimed that 2025 saw only modest institutional adoption, as she considered the likelihood of the four-year cycle and whether $88,000 represented the cycle’s low point. She remarked, “If we can get by this year, this cycle, with a 30-plus per cent drop [in Bitcoin] instead of a 50, 60, 70% drop, that will be a victory.” She also anticipates the Trump administration intends to secure a de minimis exemption, meaning small crypto trades would not be subject to capital gains tax. Florida, Texas, and other U.S. states are already working on legislation to create crypto reserves.

This expiry event is pretty much the same as last week’s , as derivatives trading remains slow, so there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets. Spot markets started the week on a high, and momentum built to a seven-week high market cap of $3.3 on Wednesday, but it failed to continue, resulting in another pullback. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s small batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1, meaning that calls (longs) and puts (shorts) are evenly matched. Max pain is around $90,000, according to Coinglass, which is pretty close to the current spot prices, so many will be in the money on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, remains highest at $100,000, which has $1.8 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There remains around $1.2 billion in OI at $75,000, $80,000, and $85,000 as bearish bets mount up. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is creeping back up at $32.7 billion. “BTC options traders kick off 2026 leaning bullish. The January $100,000 call option is the most popular bet, with a notional open interest of $1.45 billion,” noted Deribit earlier this week. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, $2.22B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $1.84B notional | Put Call: 1.05 | Max Pain: $90K BTC open interest brackets spot, with heavy puts below $85K and calls building from $90K to $100K, creating pin risk… pic.twitter.com/9H3GFgtbiC — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) January 8, 2026 In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 123,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $384 million, max pain at $3,100, and a put/call ratio of 0.89. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $7.9 billion. “ETH call positioning is concentrated above $3k. If spot holds above max pain, post-expiry positioning may leave dealers more reactive to upside continuation,” said Deribit. This brings the total crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.2 billion. Spot Market Outlook Crypto markets have fallen back in the second half of this week, with the total cap currently at $3.19 trillion. Bitcoin fell below $89,500 briefly on Thursday before recovering to reclaim $91,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. However, it remains rangebound with heavy resistance above $94,000. Ether prices have held steady above $3,000, reclaiming the resistance zone at $3,100 on Friday morning. Altcoins were predominantly in the red at the time of writing, with heavier losses for XRP, Dogecoin, and Zcash.

The tax authority is taking a firmer stance towards the total surveillance of crypto assets through Resolution 000240, requiring exchanges to disclose their users’ transaction details. Law firm Holland & Knight noted that DIAN published Resolution 000240 of December 24, 2025, in compliance with Law 1661 of 2013 and the Multilateral Agreement for the Automatic Exchange of Information under the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF). Cryptoasset Service Providers (PSCA) are required to provide the regulator with all the information on crypto transactions exceeding $50,000 in Colombia starting in 2026. PSCAs subject to reporting must also electronically report to the Colombian tax authority the types of crypto assets involved in each transaction. The regulation further establishes the descriptions of who constitutes a reportable person and who is excluded from reporting. Its goal is to prevent the use of crypto for tax evasion. DIAN sets 2026 as the first observation period DIAN disclosed that this year will be the first full observation period, although the resolution came into effect late last year. Users are, therefore, reminded that every transaction they make will be recorded by the crypto service providers for submission to DIAN. The tax authority has disclosed that May 2027 is the deadline for crypto-related platforms to submit their first major mass report. Meanwhile, the Colombian Tax and Customs Authority had already required individual users to declare crypto assets on their income tax returns as occasional gains or as part of their net worth prior to this ruling. However, the reporting remained voluntary. On the other hand, the new regulatory requirement is broad, affecting both legal entities and individuals acting as intermediaries. However, Holland & Knight notes that the average citizen should be more concerned about the automatic alerts to DIAN for retail payment transfers over $50,000. DIAN will also electronically process information about individuals’ tax residences and their net balances (excluding commissions), even if the users do not reach the $50,000 threshold. Failure to report or providing inaccurate information will lead to fines of up to 1% of the unreported transaction’s total value. Holland &Knight says timeline strictness leaves no room for doubt The law firm recently pointed out that the strictness of the timeline leaves no room for doubt, as transparency is now a mandatory legal obligation. The firm recommends that crypto users living in Colombia maintain transparency and order in their transactions. Holland & Knight specifically advises crypto users to keep a personal record of their buy and sell prices for crypto assets. The lawyers believe this is important since DIAN may need this information for cross-referencing. Users must be able to explain the origin of their crypto assets. According to the law firm, Colombia is closing the gap between tax control and technological innovation. That means a more regulated market for investors and a formal channel for incorporating digital wealth into the state’s tax system. However, the law firm also clarifies that all submitted information must comply with the rules governing updates to the Single Taxpayer Registry. All entities operating under this regulation are also responsible for updating and correcting the information as necessary and for retaining it for a specified period. Meanwhile, crypto users in Colombia should be aware that their on-chain information will no longer be private, according to Holland & Knight. Users who buy, sell, or transfer digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins, will have their information shared between crypto asset service providers and the DIAN, starting with the 2026 tax year. The Crypto Council for Innovation has observed that Colombia is keen on advancing crypto-related regulation with the aim of formalizing the sector. Colombia ranks 29th in terms of crypto adoption, with more than five million Colombians owning crypto assets. Many crypto users utilize the Wenia centralized platform, which is incorporated in Bermuda. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

According to the latest data, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is up 0.24% over the past 24 hours, with trading volume hovering near $41.6 bn. Its market capitalization stands at approximately $1.82 tn, reinforcing Bitcoin’s dominance as the anchor of the crypto market. That stability comes amid visible stress in institutional flows. Crypto ETF products recorded net outflows of roughly $380 mn, a reminder that short-term positioning remains fragile. Still, price action suggests the market is absorbing supply rather than capitulating, a subtle but important distinction for trend followers. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Triangle Compression Signals a Volatility Expansion Ahead On the daily chart, Bitcoin is coiling into a broad symmetrical triangle, defined by a descending trendline from the $107K high and a rising support base that began near $80.5K. This structure reflects compression rather than trend exhaustion, with volatility steadily contracting. Technically, the market remains constructive. Bitcoin continues to form higher lows, signaling that buyers are stepping in earlier on pullbacks. The 50-day EMA has flattened and is attempting to curl higher, while RSI has reset into a neutral-bullish range without flashing bearish divergence. Recent candles, including Doji and spinning tops, point to indecision, not distribution. Why $97K Is the Level That Matters Most The critical resistance zone sits between $94K and $97.3K, where prior supply, the triangle’s upper boundary, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement converge. A daily close above this band would likely trigger a volatility expansion. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A confirmed breakout opens the door to an initial move toward $100.7K, followed by a measured advance into the $105K–$108K region if volume confirms. On the downside, failure to hold $90K risks a pullback toward $86.9K, with stronger structural support near $80.5K. Bitcoin Outlook: A Pause Before the Next Leg From a trading perspective, Bitcoin’s price outlook remains cautious, signaling not an ending but a transition. A clean break above $97.3K would favor continuation setups targeting low six-figure prices, while downside risk stays clearly defined below rising trend support. As liquidity rotates and sentiment stabilizes, this period of compression may be remembered as the base for Bitcoin’s next directional move. For long-term investors and new entrants alike, the current structure offers a reminder that markets often move most decisively just when patience runs thin, setting the stage for renewed optimism across the digital asset space. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.43 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002775, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

57001939,655433,1767938441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57001939.jpeg,Bitcoin Breakout Followed A Sharp Cooldown In Profit-Taking: Report,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breakout-sharp-cooldown-profit-taking/,bitcoinist,"A report from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed how Bitcoin profit realization saw a reset ahead of the recent price surge. Bitcoin Realized Profit Has Gone Down Recently In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Realized Profit of Bitcoin. This on-chain indicator measures the total amount of profit that investors on the BTC network are realizing through their transactions. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being moved or sold on the network to see what price it was transacted at prior to this. If the last transaction price of the token was less than the spot price it’s now being sold at, then the sale is considered to realize some net gain. The exact amount of profit involved in the transfer is equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this value for all profit transactions on the blockchain. A counterpart indicator known as the Realized Loss takes care of the sales of the opposite type. That is, the moves involving a cost basis higher than the latest transfer price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Realized Profit over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Realized Profit was above the $1 billion level for much of the fourth quarter of 2025, with a particularly large spike of nearly $3 billion coming in November that coincided with the cryptocurrency’s bottom. In December, however, the metric saw a sharp decline to a value of just $183.8 million. “This deceleration in realized gains, particularly among longer-term holders, signalled an exhaustion of distribution-side pressure that had been anchoring price action in the prior quarter,” noted Glassnode. What followed this cooldown in profit-taking was BTC’s climb above $94,000 during the first week of 2026. “As sell-side intensity eased, the market was able to stabilize, regain composure, and support a renewed upside impulse,” said the analytics firm. The Realized Profit and Realized Loss deal with the profit/loss being realized by the investors, but what about the unrealized profits or losses? An indicator called the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio contains the information related to that. In the report, Glassnode has specifically discussed about this indicator for the short-term holders (STHs), representing the low-conviction side of the market (holding time of 155 days or less). From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin STH MVRV has been below the 1 level recently, implying that the new market entrants have been holding a net unrealized loss. BTC Price Bitcoin fell under $90,000 earlier in the day, but the asset has since rebounded to $90,900.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin breakout|Bitcoin Profit Realization|Bitcoin profit-taking|btc|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Data from the world’s three largest crypto futures exchanges by open interest—Binance, OKX, and Bybit—shows a collective, albeit slight, tilt towards short positions. This metric provides a crucial, real-time pulse on professional trader positioning and potential market direction. As of the latest 24-hour snapshot, the aggregate ratio stands at 48.92% long versus 51.08% short, signaling a cautious, if not bearish, near-term outlook among leveraged market participants. Understanding this data requires context about derivatives markets, exchange dynamics, and historical patterns. Decoding the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio The long/short ratio for BTC perpetual futures is a fundamental sentiment gauge. It measures the proportion of open leveraged positions betting on price increases (longs) versus those betting on declines (shorts). A ratio above 50% long indicates bullish aggregate positioning, while below 50% suggests bearishness. However, analysts often interpret extreme readings contrarily. For instance, a very high long ratio can signal over-optimism and a potential market top. The current aggregated figure of 48.92% long sits just below the neutral midpoint, reflecting a measured skepticism. This data is compiled from millions of anonymous trader accounts, offering a transparent window into institutional and retail sentiment without revealing individual strategies. Perpetual futures, unlike traditional futures, lack an expiry date. Traders use them for speculative leverage or hedging. Consequently, the long/short ratio on these instruments often reacts faster to news and price movements than spot market data. Major exchanges calculate this ratio differently, but the core methodology compares the total value of open long contracts to open short contracts. Monitoring shifts in this ratio can provide early warnings of sentiment changes. A sustained move below 48% long, for example, might indicate growing fear or expectation of a downturn. Conversely, a rapid swing above 52% long could foreshadow a bullish squeeze. Exchange-by-Exchange Analysis of Bitcoin Derivatives Sentiment The overall market picture gains depth when examining individual exchange data. Each platform caters to a slightly different user demographic, which can influence collective positioning. The provided 24-hour data reveals nuanced differences between the three giants. Binance: The world’s largest exchange shows a near-perfect equilibrium. With 49.13% long and 50.87% short, Binance’s ratio is the most balanced of the trio. This suggests its vast and diverse user base is almost evenly split on immediate direction. OKX: This exchange displays the most pronounced bearish tilt among the three, with only 47.48% of positions long. The 52.52% short ratio indicates a stronger conviction for downward price movement among OKX traders, which may reflect regional sentiment or specific institutional activity on the platform. Bybit: Positioned closely to the aggregate, Bybit’s ratio of 48.98% long mirrors the overall market’s slight short bias. Bybit is popular with professional retail traders, and this data suggests a cautious, risk-aware stance is prevalent. The following table summarizes the key data points for clarity: Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Sentiment Overall Aggregate 48.92% 51.08% Slightly Bearish Binance 49.13% 50.87% Neutral to Bearish OKX 47.48% 52.52% Bearish Bybit 48.98% 51.02% Slightly Bearish The Impact of Open Interest and Funding Rates Interpreting the long/short ratio in isolation offers an incomplete picture. Seasoned analysts always cross-reference it with two other critical derivatives metrics: total open interest and funding rates. Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. Rising open interest alongside a shifting long/short ratio confirms new money is supporting the sentiment move. If open interest is falling, the ratio shift may just be position closures. Funding rates are periodic payments between long and short traders to peg perpetual contract prices to the spot market. A positive rate means longs pay shorts, often occurring when sentiment is overly bullish. A negative rate means shorts pay longs, typical during bearish phases. Currently, with the aggregate ratio slightly favoring shorts, one would typically expect slightly negative or neutral funding rates. This alignment would confirm the sentiment data is not distorted. A discrepancy—like a bearish ratio with highly positive funding—would signal a complex, potentially unstable market structure. Furthermore, large “whale” wallets can sometimes skew exchange-specific ratios. A single entity opening a massive hedge on OKX could explain its more bearish reading compared to Binance. Therefore, the ratio is a starting point for analysis, not a definitive predictor. Historical Context and Real-World Market Implications The current BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio must be viewed through a historical lens. During the bull market peaks of 2021 and late 2023, aggregate long ratios frequently exceeded 55% and even reached extremes above 60%. These periods often preceded significant corrections. Conversely, during major capitulation events like the LUNA collapse or the FTX bankruptcy, long ratios plummeted into the low 40s or even 30s, which subsequently marked potential buying opportunities for contrarians. The present reading in the high 40s is historically associated with consolidation phases or the early stages of a trend change. This sentiment data has direct implications. A market heavily skewed short is vulnerable to a short squeeze . A rapid price increase can force short sellers to buy back BTC to cover their positions, amplifying the upward move. The current environment, with a modest short bias, is not extreme enough to suggest a high probability of a violent squeeze. However, it does indicate that the leveraged trader cohort is not overly confident in continued rallies. This can create a healthier foundation for a sustained uptrend, as excessive leverage has already been somewhat reduced. For spot investors, this derivatives data suggests a lack of euphoria, which is often a positive sign in longer-term market cycles. Expert Perspective on Derivatives as a Sentiment Tool Market analysts consistently emphasize that derivatives data like the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is a measure of trader positioning , not a direct forecast of price. “The crowd is often wrong at extremes,” notes a veteran crypto hedge fund manager, whose commentary is regularly cited in institutional reports. “A neutral-to-slightly-bearish ratio like this one often reflects a market that is digesting information, waiting for a catalyst. It tells you there is fuel on both sides of the trade.” Regulatory developments, macroeconomic data like CPI reports, or Bitcoin ETF flow statistics typically act as the catalysts that tip this balanced sentiment in one direction. Furthermore, the convergence of ratios across major exchanges adds validity to the signal. When Binance, OKX, and Bybit all show a similar directional tilt—even a mild one—it reflects a global consensus among active traders. This consensus can become a self-fulfilling prophecy in the short term, as traders act on the perceived sentiment. However, the market’s inherent function is to prove the majority wrong at turning points. Therefore, continuous monitoring for a breakout from this narrow band (e.g., a surge above 52% long or a drop below 46% long) is more significant than the absolute level itself. Conclusion The latest BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio presents a market in careful equilibrium with a slight bearish inclination. The aggregated data of 48.92% long across Binance, OKX, and Bybit indicates that professional and leveraged traders are not convinced of an imminent bullish breakout. Instead, they are positioning with caution, as reflected in the net short bias. This sentiment snapshot, when combined with other metrics like open interest and funding rates, provides invaluable context for navigating the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. While not a standalone trading signal, this ratio is an essential tool for understanding the psychological undercurrents of the market. As always, shifts in this key indicator will warrant close attention in the coming days for clues to Bitcoin’s next major move. FAQs Q1: What does a BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio below 50% mean? A ratio below 50% long indicates that, in aggregate, traders on that exchange have more open short positions (betting on price decreases) than long positions (betting on increases). This suggests a bearish or cautious market sentiment among leveraged participants. Q2: Why do the ratios differ between Binance, OKX, and Bybit? Each exchange has a different user base, including varying proportions of retail traders, institutions, algorithmic funds, and regional demographics. Different trading strategies, risk appetites, and access to information can lead to slight variations in collective positioning. Q3: Is the long/short ratio a reliable predictor of Bitcoin’s price? No, it is not a direct predictor. It is a sentiment indicator. Extreme readings can sometimes signal potential reversals (e.g., too many longs may lead to a sell-off), but it should always be used in conjunction with price action, volume, open interest, and fundamental analysis. Q4: How often does this data update? The long/short ratio data typically updates in real-time or on a 24-hour rolling basis, as reported by the exchanges themselves. Major data analytics sites compile and display this information continuously. Q5: Can the ratio be manipulated by large traders or “whales”? Yes, on an individual exchange level, a very large player opening a substantial hedge or directional bet can temporarily skew the ratio. This is why analysts look at aggregate data across multiple major exchanges to get a clearer picture of broader market sentiment.

This comprehensive analysis examines historical patterns, fundamental developments, and expert projections to provide a balanced perspective on Bitcoin’s future valuation. The cryptocurrency market, while volatile, follows identifiable cycles influenced by technological adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Understanding Bitcoin price predictions requires examining multiple analytical frameworks. Historical data reveals distinct market cycles since Bitcoin’s 2009 inception. Each four-year halving event has preceded significant price movements. The 2012 halving preceded a 9,000% price increase over the following year. Similarly, the 2016 halving preceded a 2,800% rally. Most recently, the 2024 halving established new baseline conditions for future growth. Analysts combine these historical patterns with fundamental metrics including network hash rate, active addresses, and institutional adoption rates. Several analytical approaches inform current predictions. On-chain analysis examines blockchain data for investor behavior insights. Technical analysis identifies chart patterns and support levels. Fundamental analysis evaluates adoption metrics and utility growth. Experts typically weight these approaches differently based on their assessment frameworks. Consequently, predictions vary significantly between analysts. However, consensus emerges around key influencing factors that will shape Bitcoin’s trajectory through 2030. Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin’s Future Valuation Multiple interconnected factors will determine Bitcoin’s price evolution. Institutional adoption represents perhaps the most significant variable. Major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin investment products. Corporate treasury allocations continue growing steadily. Meanwhile, regulatory clarity in major markets either facilitates or hinders institutional participation. The United States SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. This development opened traditional investment channels. Other jurisdictions follow similar paths toward regulatory frameworks. Technological developments also impact Bitcoin’s value proposition. The Lightning Network enables faster, cheaper transactions. Taproot upgrades improve privacy and smart contract functionality. These improvements enhance Bitcoin’s utility beyond store-of-value applications. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions influence cryptocurrency valuations. Inflation concerns drive demand for inflation-resistant assets. Currency devaluation in various countries increases Bitcoin adoption. Global economic stability or instability creates corresponding effects on digital asset markets. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Post-Halving Analysis The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. Historical precedent suggests significant price appreciation typically follows halving events. However, the exact timing and magnitude vary across cycles. By 2026, Bitcoin will have completed approximately two years of its post-2024-halving cycle. Analysts project this period could see substantial price appreciation if historical patterns hold. Several investment firms publish formal 2026 projections based on different scenarios. Bloomberg Intelligence suggests Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by 2026 under moderate adoption scenarios. This projection assumes continued institutional investment flows. It also presumes regulatory environments remain generally favorable. More conservative analysts cite $75,000 as a reasonable 2026 target. These projections consider potential economic headwinds. They also account for possible regulatory challenges in key markets. Bullish scenarios from firms like Standard Chartered suggest $120,000+ possibilities. These projections assume accelerated institutional adoption and favorable macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2030 Comparison Year Conservative Estimate Moderate Estimate Bullish Estimate Primary Drivers 2026 $75,000 $100,000 $120,000+ Post-halving cycle, ETF flows 2027 $90,000 $150,000 $200,000+ Institutional maturity, global adoption 2028 $120,000 $200,000 $300,000+ Network effects, scarcity premium 2029 $150,000 $250,000 $400,000+ Halving anticipation, technological upgrades 2030 $200,000 $350,000 $500,000+ Full cycle completion, mainstream integration Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027-2028: Mid-Cycle Projections The 2027-2028 period represents the potential peak phase of the current market cycle. Historical Bitcoin cycles typically peak approximately 18-24 months after halving events. If this pattern continues, 2027 could see significant price appreciation. However, analysts caution that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Market maturity may alter traditional cycle dynamics. Increased institutional participation could reduce volatility. It might also extend cycle durations beyond historical norms. Several development milestones could influence 2027-2028 valuations. Bitcoin’s scalability solutions may achieve broader implementation by this period. Layer-2 adoption could significantly increase transaction capacity. This development would enhance Bitcoin’s utility for everyday transactions. Additionally, central bank digital currency developments might create integration opportunities. Some analysts suggest CBDC systems could incorporate Bitcoin reserves. Such developments would substantially increase institutional demand. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Valuation Models Prominent analysts employ various models for long-term Bitcoin valuation. Stock-to-flow models compare Bitcoin’s circulating supply to annual production. These models have historically correlated with price movements. However, critics note diminishing predictive power as Bitcoin matures. Network value models assess price relative to user adoption metrics. These include active addresses and transaction volumes. Metcalfe’s Law adaptations suggest network value grows with user square. Store-of-value comparisons provide another analytical framework. Analysts compare Bitcoin’s market capitalization to traditional stores like gold. Gold currently maintains approximately $15 trillion in global value. Bitcoin’s market capitalization remains significantly lower. Some projections suggest Bitcoin could capture 10-20% of gold’s store-of-value market by 2030. This scenario would imply substantial price appreciation from current levels. However, this analysis assumes continued adoption as digital gold without major competitive disruptions. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2029-2030: The Next Halving Cycle The next Bitcoin halving will likely occur around April 2028. This event will reduce block rewards from 3.125 to approximately 1.5625 BTC. Historical patterns suggest anticipation typically builds during the preceding year. Consequently, 2029 could see increased market activity and price volatility. The 2030 period represents the potential early phase of the post-2028-halving cycle. Projections for this timeframe involve greater uncertainty. However, analysts identify several potential scenarios based on current trends. Technological maturity represents a key variable for 2030 projections. Bitcoin’s infrastructure may achieve greater stability and security by this period. Institutional custody solutions will likely become more sophisticated. Regulatory frameworks should provide clearer guidelines in most jurisdictions. These developments could reduce perceived investment risks. Consequently, allocation percentages within investment portfolios might increase substantially. Even modest percentage increases across global portfolios would significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. Adoption metrics: Active addresses, transaction volumes, and wallet growth Institutional indicators: ETF flows, corporate treasury allocations, and pension fund participation Macroeconomic factors: Inflation rates, currency stability, and geopolitical developments Technological developments: Layer-2 adoption, privacy enhancements, and smart contract capabilities Regulatory environment: Clear frameworks, taxation policies, and international coordination Potential Challenges and Risk Factors While optimistic projections exist, investors must consider potential challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant concern in various jurisdictions. Some governments may impose restrictive policies on cryptocurrency usage. Technological competition presents another consideration. Other blockchain networks offer different capabilities and trade-offs. Bitcoin must maintain its security and decentralization advantages. Meanwhile, quantum computing developments could theoretically threaten cryptographic security. However, the Bitcoin community actively researches quantum-resistant solutions. Market dynamics introduce additional complexity. Traditional financial crises could impact all asset classes including cryptocurrencies. Liquidity constraints during market stress might amplify volatility. Furthermore, environmental concerns regarding energy usage persist. Bitcoin mining increasingly utilizes renewable energy sources. The network’s hash rate continues growing while improving its energy mix. These developments address sustainability concerns but require ongoing monitoring and improvement. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 involve analyzing complex, interconnected variables. Historical patterns suggest potential appreciation following the 2024 halving event. However, Bitcoin’s increasing maturity may alter traditional cycle dynamics. Multiple analytical frameworks provide different perspectives on future valuations. Conservative estimates suggest gradual appreciation toward $200,000 by 2030. More optimistic scenarios project $500,000+ under accelerated adoption conditions. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s trajectory will depend on technological developments, regulatory environments, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic conditions. Investors should consider these Bitcoin price predictions as informed scenarios rather than guarantees, maintaining balanced perspectives amid market evolution. FAQs Q1: What is the most reliable method for Bitcoin price prediction? No single method guarantees accuracy, but combining on-chain analysis, technical patterns, and fundamental metrics provides the most comprehensive approach. Analysts typically weight multiple methodologies based on market conditions. Q2: How does the Bitcoin halving affect price predictions? Historical data shows significant price appreciation typically follows halving events due to reduced new supply. However, the exact timing and magnitude vary across cycles, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Q3: What represents the biggest risk to Bitcoin’s price growth through 2030? Regulatory uncertainty in major markets poses significant potential challenges. Restrictive policies could limit institutional participation and mainstream adoption, potentially impacting price trajectories. Q4: How do institutional investments influence Bitcoin price predictions? Institutional participation increases market stability and liquidity while validating Bitcoin as an asset class. Significant institutional inflows typically support higher price projections across most analytical models. Q5: Can Bitcoin realistically reach $500,000 by 2030? While some bullish models suggest this possibility under optimal conditions, most moderate projections range between $200,000-$350,000. Such high projections require accelerated global adoption and favorable regulatory environments.

Sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that the ETH scaling network is “close to” acquiring the BTC ATM company, with Architect Partners serving as its financial advisor. Cryptonews has reached out to Coinme executives for confirmation. Coinme is one of the earlier entrants in Bitcoin ATM operations in the US. It first launched a crypto kiosk in 2014 and now has more than 50,000 Bitcoin ATM locations across 49 US states. Is Coinme Halting Bitcoin ATM Operations? Last month, Washington state’s Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) ordered Coinme to halt all money transmission services . The regulator alleges that the Seattle-based company illegally converted unredeemed customer funds into corporate revenue. Further, the DFI ordered the firm to repay over $8 million to customers. Coinme reportedly asked customers to purchase paper vouchers at kiosks and redeem them online. However, when the vouchers were unredeemed within a timeframe, Coinme claimed the outstanding balances as its own income. As a result, Coinme is now facing a potential revocation of its license, a $300,000 fine, and a likely 10-year industry ban for the company and its CEO, Neil Bergquist. Polygon’s acquisition of Coinme is seen as an important step for both companies, given that Polygon completed a $450 million funding round in 2023, led by Sequoia Capital India.

57003729,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260057,1767944111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Shatter $1.1B in Three Days, Dampening Market Optimism",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-bitcoin-etf-outflows-dampen-optimism/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Shatter $1.1B in Three Days, Dampening Market Optimism NEW YORK, January 2025 – A wave of significant capital flight from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is abruptly cooling the early-year optimism that had buoyed cryptocurrency markets. Data reveals these investment vehicles witnessed net outflows surpassing $1.1 billion over just three trading days, nearly erasing the robust inflows that marked the start of the month. Consequently, this rapid shift signals a potential reassessment of conviction among major institutional buyers, redirecting market focus toward impending macroeconomic catalysts. Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Reach a Critical $1.13 Billion According to data from Farside Investors, cited in a CoinDesk report, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows totaling $1.13 billion from Monday through Wednesday. This substantial movement of capital stands in stark contrast to the positive sentiment that opened January. Moreover, these outflows have almost completely offset the $1.16 billion in net inflows that accumulated in the first several days of the month. The velocity of this reversal is capturing the attention of traders and analysts globally. This trend primarily reflects activity in the U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January 2024 after receiving regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. These products, offered by major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, provide traditional investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price without the complexities of direct custody. Therefore, their flows serve as a critical, transparent gauge for institutional and large-scale investor sentiment toward the flagship cryptocurrency. Institutional Conviction Shows Signs of Wavering The dramatic outflow pattern is widely interpreted as a signal of wavering conviction among the institutional players who had been steadily accumulating positions. Several factors may be contributing to this cautious pivot. First, profit-taking after a sustained period of price appreciation is a common and rational market behavior. Second, investors often rebalance portfolios at the start of a new quarter or fiscal year, which can trigger short-term volatility in fund flows. Furthermore, the broader macroeconomic landscape introduces headwinds. Rising treasury yields and a strengthening U.S. dollar have historically pressured risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The market is now keenly awaiting two key events: the release of December’s U.S. employment data and a pivotal U.S. Supreme Court ruling on tariff policies from the previous administration. These events could significantly influence fiscal policy, inflation expectations, and overall market risk appetite. Spot Bitcoin ETF Flow Snapshot: Early January 2025 Period Net Flow Cumulative Impact First Week of January +$1.16B Inflows Boosted market optimism Subsequent 3 Days -$1.13B Outflows Nearly erased monthly gains Net Monthly Change (To Date) ~+$30M Effectively neutralized Expert Analysis on Market Dynamics Market analysts emphasize that ETF flow volatility is a normal characteristic of a maturing but still nascent financial product. “While three days of outflows are notable, they represent a single data point in a longer-term adoption curve,” explains a veteran crypto market strategist. “The true test will be sustained flow patterns over quarters, not days. However, this does underscore Bitcoin’s continued sensitivity to traditional macro forces, even within its new ETF wrapper.” Historical context is also crucial. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 was a watershed moment, legitimizing Bitcoin for a vast pool of regulated capital. Initial flows were overwhelmingly positive, establishing a multi-billion-dollar asset class within a year. Periods of consolidation and outflow were always anticipated as part of the natural ebb and flow of capital allocation. Consequently, the current activity may represent a healthy market digestion phase rather than a fundamental breakdown. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Impact and Trajectory The outflow news has exerted clear downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, with the asset retreating from recent highs. This movement often creates a ripple effect across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Altcoins, which typically exhibit higher correlation with Bitcoin during periods of stress, have also faced selling pressure. Market participants are now closely monitoring support levels and trading volume for signs of stabilization or further decline. Key technical and on-chain metrics are under scrutiny: Exchange Reserves: Tracking whether Bitcoin is moving off exchanges (a bullish sign of holding) or onto them (potentially for selling). Miner Activity: Observing if miners are under pressure to sell their coinbase rewards, which can increase market supply. Derivatives Data: Analyzing funding rates and open interest in futures markets to gauge trader sentiment. Simultaneously, the regulatory environment remains a backdrop constant. While the ETF structure itself is now approved, ongoing discussions about digital asset legislation, custody rules, and tax treatment continue to shape long-term institutional strategy. The market is processing these short-term flows within that larger, evolving framework. Conclusion The $1.13 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF outflows over three days presents a clear narrative shift for the cryptocurrency market in early 2025. This movement has effectively neutralized the month’s early gains, highlighting the fluid nature of institutional capital allocation. While the trend cools immediate bullish optimism, it also reflects the maturation of Bitcoin as an asset class subject to traditional investment cycles and macroeconomic sensitivities. The market’s next direction will likely hinge on the upcoming employment data and Supreme Court ruling, reminding investors that Bitcoin’s journey, even within an ETF, remains intertwined with the broader financial world. FAQs Q1: What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are investment funds traded on traditional stock exchanges that hold actual Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without needing to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Q2: Why are ETF outflows significant? ETF outflows are significant because they represent institutional and large-scale investors redeeming their shares for cash, which requires the fund to sell its underlying Bitcoin holdings. This can increase selling pressure on the market and serves as a direct indicator of waning demand from major players. Q3: Do three days of outflows mean the Bitcoin ETF experiment is failing? No. Short-term volatility in flows is expected for any financial product. The success of Bitcoin ETFs is measured over years, considering total assets under management (AUM) and sustained accessibility they provide. Periodic outflows are a normal part of market cycles. Q4: How do macroeconomic events like employment data affect Bitcoin? Strong employment data can signal a robust economy but may also imply persistent inflation, potentially leading to higher interest rates. Higher rates make safe, yield-bearing assets more attractive relative to speculative assets like Bitcoin, often leading to price pressure. Q5: Where can investors track Bitcoin ETF flow data? Several analytics firms and financial data platforms provide this information. Farside Investors is one prominent source that aggregates daily flow data for U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, which is then widely reported by financial news outlets like CoinDesk and Bloomberg.

Consequently, aggregate open interest across major exchanges plummeted to levels not seen since the bear market of 2022, according to on-chain analytics. This simultaneous decline in both price and leverage positions signals a market-wide unwinding of speculative excess, a process that historically precedes periods of consolidation or trend reversal. Understanding the Bitcoin Derivatives Market Shift The derivatives market for Bitcoin, encompassing futures and perpetual swap contracts, serves as a critical barometer for trader sentiment and leverage. Specifically, open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. A sharp decline in OI, especially when coupled with falling prices, typically indicates that leveraged positions are being forcibly closed or voluntarily exited. This process, known as deleveraging, reduces systemic risk within the market. Data from CryptoQuant, highlighted by contributor Arab Chain, shows a synchronized 30-day OI volume decrease across Binance, Bybit, Gate.io, and OKX as of January 8. This widespread activity strongly suggests a macro-level correction rather than isolated exchange behavior. The Mechanics of Market Deleveraging Deleveraging occurs through a defined sequence of market events. Initially, a price drop triggers liquidation calls for over-leveraged long positions. Subsequently, exchanges automatically close these positions, selling the underlying collateral. This selling pressure can exacerbate the price decline, potentially triggering further liquidations in a cascade. However, once this cycle completes, the market often finds a more stable foundation. The current data reveals this exact pattern unfolding. The reduction in open interest directly correlates with the flushing out of excessive leverage, which had built up during previous volatile periods. Market analysts closely monitor funding rates—the fees paid between long and short positions—for confirmation. Notably, neutral or negative funding rates often accompany healthy deleveraging, indicating reduced speculative fervor. Historical Precedents and Price Implications Historical analysis provides crucial context for the current derivatives data. Periods of sharply declining open interest have frequently marked local bottoms or inflection points in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. For instance, similar deleveraging events were observed in June 2022 and November 2022, both of which preceded multi-month periods of sideways consolidation and eventual rallies. The logic is straightforward: by removing unstable, leveraged positions, the market sheds ‘weak hands’ and overextended speculators. What remains is often a core of stronger, more conviction-based holdings. Arab Chain’s observation aligns with this analysis, noting that such conditions have historically preceded price stabilization or a rebound. This does not guarantee an immediate price surge, but it significantly reduces the probability of a catastrophic, leverage-fueled crash. The market transitions from a speculative casino to a more fundamentally grounded asset, at least temporarily. Comparing 2025 Data to Previous Market Cycles A comparative timeline offers deeper insight. The table below contrasts key derivatives metrics from major deleveraging phases: Period Open Interest Drop Price Action After 90 Days Primary Catalyst May 2021 ~40% Sideways Consolidation China Mining Ban Announcement June 2022 ~50% Further Decline, Then Base Formation 3AC & Celsius Collapse November 2022 ~35% Gradual Recovery Began FTX Collapse Aftermath January 2025 (Current) ~30% (and ongoing) To Be Determined Macro Uncertainty & Leverage Washout This comparison reveals that while the trigger events differ, the market’s mechanism for shedding risk remains consistent. The current phase appears less extreme than the 2022 events, potentially indicating a healthier overall market structure despite the decline. The Role of Major Exchanges and Institutional Behavior The simultaneous OI decline across Binance, Bybit, Gate.io, and OKX is particularly noteworthy. These platforms collectively represent the vast majority of global crypto derivatives volume. Their synchronized movement suggests a universal reaction to broader macroeconomic or crypto-specific factors, rather than platform-specific issues. Several potential contributing factors exist: Macroeconomic Pressure: Rising traditional interest rates can make leveraged crypto positions less attractive. Regulatory Developments: Evolving global frameworks may prompt institutional players to reduce exposure. Volatility Expectations: A prolonged period of low volatility can lead to the decay of options positions and a natural OI decline. Risk Reassessment: Traders may be proactively de-risking ahead of uncertain events. Institutional traders, who utilize derivatives for hedging as much as for speculation, likely play a key role. Their risk management protocols often mandate leverage reduction during periods of high uncertainty. Therefore, the current deleveraging may reflect a cautious, professional recalibration of market exposure. Impact on Spot Market and Long-Term Holders The derivatives deleveraging has a tangible effect on the spot Bitcoin market. Initially, liquidation-driven selling creates downward pressure. However, once completed, the spot market often decouples from derivatives-led volatility. Long-term holders (LTHs), who measure their holdings in years rather than days, typically remain unfazed by these phases. On-chain data often shows LTH supply remaining steady or even increasing during deleveraging, as they accumulate from distressed sellers. This dynamic creates a transfer of assets from weak, leveraged hands to stronger, long-term oriented hands. Consequently, the average cost basis of the market can rise, establishing a higher floor price. This process is essential for building the foundation for the next sustainable bull run, as it increases overall holder conviction and reduces floating supply. Expert Analysis and Market Sentiment Indicators Beyond open interest, analysts monitor a suite of complementary indicators to confirm a deleveraging trend. Funding rates, as mentioned, have normalized. Additionally, the Long/Short Ratio and Liquidations Data provide color. A decrease in the ratio of long to short positions, coupled with a high volume of long liquidations, confirms the unwind. Social media sentiment and fear & greed indices also tend to hit extreme fear during these phases, which can serve as a contrary indicator. The current environment, as described by Arab Chain and corroborated by independent data from Glassnode and CoinMetrics, fits the textbook definition of a healthy market reset. It is a necessary, albeit painful, process that purges the system of excess and aligns price more closely with underlying network fundamentals like hash rate and active address growth. Conclusion The Bitcoin derivatives market is undergoing a significant and necessary deleveraging phase, with open interest retreating to multi-year lows. This synchronized decline across global exchanges indicates a broad-based reduction in speculative leverage. Historically, such periods have served as cleansing mechanisms, setting the stage for price stabilization and potentially healthier future advances. While short-term volatility may persist during the unwind, the reduction in systemic leverage ultimately decreases the risk of a severe, cascading crash. Market participants should view this development not with alarm, but as a typical and cyclical recalibration of the Bitcoin derivatives landscape. The focus now shifts to whether this reset will lead to a prolonged basing pattern or a more rapid recovery, guided by evolving macroeconomic conditions and institutional adoption trends. FAQs Q1: What does “open interest” mean in Bitcoin derivatives? A1: Open interest refers to the total number of active, unsettled futures or perpetual swap contracts. It is a key metric for gauging market activity and leverage levels. A rising OI suggests new money and positions entering, while falling OI indicates positions are being closed. Q2: Why is a decline in open interest considered a sign of deleveraging? A2: When open interest falls simultaneously with price, it typically means traders are closing leveraged positions, often due to margin calls or voluntary risk reduction. This unwinds the “leverage” (borrowed capital) in the system, hence the term deleveraging. Q3: Does deleveraging always lead to a Bitcoin price rebound? A3: Not immediately, and it is not a guarantee. Historically, deleveraging often leads to a period of price stabilization or basing. It removes weak, forced sellers, which can create a firmer foundation for a future move, but the timing and direction of that move depend on broader factors. Q4: How does this 2025 deleveraging compare to past events? A4: The current phase appears less severe in magnitude than the extreme deleveraging seen during the collapses of 3AC, Celsius, and FTX in 2022. It more closely resembles a routine market correction and leverage washout, suggesting a relatively healthier underlying market structure. Q5: What should traders monitor during a deleveraging phase? A5: Key indicators include the rate of change in open interest, funding rates (which should normalize), liquidation volumes, and on-chain metrics like exchange flows. A stabilization in these metrics often signals the deleveraging process is nearing completion.

The episode has drawn attention not because of any legal action, but because it shows how screenshots of prediction markets and crypto tribalism can blur into misleading narratives. A Viral Screenshot, Rising Odds, and Missing Verification The discussion began when X user Hooman posted a screenshot claiming Polymarket odds had jumped from 35% to 53% on whether Lee would face fraud-related charges next year. The post quickly gained traction, prompting confusion and jokes across Crypto Twitter, with one user, Sean K, openly questioning whether the claim was real, while others searched for the market themselves. The alleged odds movement supposedly came following controversy around BitMine Immersion Technologies, where Lee serves as chairman. The company holds more than 3% of Ethereum’s supply and is currently dealing with a shareholder probe tied to fiduciary duties and share dilution . Importantly, none of that involves criminal accusations against Lee. Several prominent accounts pushed back almost immediately. YouTuber Crypto Rover labeled the claim fake news, and Tommi Montana described it as defamatory. In several responses, X’s AI Grok stated that Polymarket does not list any markets for Tom Lee facing securities fraud or Ponzi scheme charges and that no confirmed investigations exist as of January 2026. This reporting reached the same conclusion. A direct search on Polymarket for “Tom Lee” on January 9 showed no market resembling the one described in the viral screenshot. The available results related to unrelated political races, sports bets, and general crypto sentiment questions, not legal outcomes tied to the Fundstrat co-founder. Community Splits, Memes Flourish, and Facts Lag Behind Reactions to the post followed familiar crypto lines. Some Bitcoin-focused commentators mocked Lee for a long record of optimistic price calls, treating the rumor as an extension of ongoing jokes about missed targets. Meanwhile, Ethereum supporters took a different view, with one of them, influencer yourfriendSOMMI, claiming that Bitcoin maximalists were spreading false fear to undermine ETH, pointing to Lee’s public comments about Wall Street interest in the world’s second-largest crypto asset. Others treated the episode as pure entertainment, with users asking where to place bets that did not appear to exist. What remains clear is that no regulator, law enforcement body, or mainstream outlet has reported probes or charges involving Lee. The incident serves as a reminder that prediction markets and viral screenshots may often reflect sentiment, humor, or coordinated trolling rather than reality. Without basic verification, speculation can briefly pass as news, even when the underlying market is nowhere to be found.

The setup matters, he argued, because the model has historically been associated with higher prices after corrective periods, even if its record is no longer spotless. In the video, Kev Capital walked viewers through the weekly Bitcoin chart with the hash ribbons overlay, describing it as one of the higher “hit rate” signals in crypto’s technical playbook. “There have been 19 buy signals on the weekly time frame throughout all of Bitcoin’s history and it has an 84% hit rate of playing out,” he said, adding that such consistency is rare for any single indicator. Hash ribbons attempt to infer miner stress and recovery by comparing short- and longer-term moving averages of network hash rate. Kev Capital framed it less as a simple “buy/sell” tool and more as a proxy for network health, where miner behavior can precede shifts in market structure. “It’s not just a buy and sell indicator. It’s tracking mining hash rate,” he said. “And what that basically means is it’s tracking the overall power and network health on the Bitcoin blockchain.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Nears Neutral As Price Recovers The mechanics, as he explained them, hinge on the 30-day moving average of hash rate (his chart showed this as a green line) versus the 60-day moving average (a gray line). When the 30-day crosses below the 60-day, the model labels it capitulation, which he described as aligning with bearish price action and a weaker network backdrop. When the 30-day crosses back above the 60-day, the indicator prints a buy signal (shown as blue dots on his chart), which he interprets as miners “rebounding” after weaker operators have been forced out. “Anytime that 30-day crosses below the 60, it marks a capitulation phase, which shows that there’s been bearish price action in a weaker network,” Kev Capital said. “Now, when it crosses back above is when you get the blue dots, and that is a buy signal. That’s when the 30-day moving average of hash rate crosses back above the 60-day moving average of hash rate.” Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Buy Signal Returns The near-term catalyst for his update was a fresh signal sequence around the end of December. Kev Capital said the hash ribbons flashed capitulation in the second-to-last week of December, followed by a buy signal in the last week of December. He noted the indicator was again “flashing a capitulation signal” during the current week, not yet confirmed which could set up another buy signal if the moving averages continue to “mingle” and then resolve higher. Related Reading: Why Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF Is The ‘Most Bullish Thing Ever’: Jeff Park He also spent time qualifying the model’s reputation. While he cited an 84% historical hit rate for the weekly buy signals, he said that earlier in the current cycle the indicator printed two buy signals: in May and July that did not deliver the kind of follow-through that has defined prior successful instances. “We did go up from the original buy signal, but it really wasn’t a lot,” he said, contrasting that with prior hash ribbons episodes that “typically produce a 30 to 100% move.” In his telling, those underwhelming outcomes were enough to break what he described as a prior “100% hit rate” framing. https://t.co/vfZFXTAN77 #BTC Weekly Hash Ribbons buy signal and what it means. #Crypto #Altcoins — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) January 8, 2026 Still, Kev Capital argues the context is now different because the latest signal comes after a drawdown. He referenced a 36% decline in Bitcoin during the recent corrective period and suggested the early signs of miner recovery, reflected in the moving averages stabilizing and attempting to turn up, are the conditions where the indicator has historically performed best. However, he cautioned that timing is variable, saying the setup can take “two to four to six weeks” to play out, or move sooner. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,009.

The suspect challenged the seizure, arguing that Bitcoin held in exchange accounts did not qualify as physical property subject to confiscation under Article 106 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which limits seizures to evidence or items “ recognized as related to the case .” After the Seoul Central District Court upheld the seizure as lawful, the Supreme Court’s Second Division, led by Justice Kwon Young-jun, affirmed that ruling on appeal. The court stated that seizure targets under the Criminal Procedure Act encompass both tangible objects and electronic information, with Bitcoin qualifying as “ an electronic token with the ability to be independently managed, traded, and substantially controlled in terms of economic value. “ The justices noted that Bitcoin management and trading within exchanges can be practically controlled by holders through private keys stored in electronic wallets, establishing sufficient control to meet seizure requirements. The decision builds on the Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling that classified Bitcoin as intangible property with economic value subject to state confiscation, and its 2021 judgment recognizing virtual assets as property interests in fraud cases. Ruling Arrives as Regulators Expand Seizure Authority The Supreme Court’s clarification coincides with proposals from the Financial Services Commission to implement a payment freeze system that would allow authorities to lock crypto accounts before suspected criminal proceeds are withdrawn. Officials told local media in November that current rules require court warrants during the prosecution phase, creating delays that allow suspects to move funds into private wallets or overseas platforms beyond regulatory reach. The proposed mechanism would mirror stock market controls introduced under the April 2025 amendments to the Capital Markets Act. South Korea may introduce preemptive crypto account freezes to prevent price manipulation and illicit gains. #SouthKorea #MarketManipulation https://t.co/WS9qDxcOd2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 6, 2026 In September, regulators froze 75 accounts linked to a 100 billion won stock manipulation scheme, preventing withdrawal of 40 billion won in realized and unrealized profits. FSC members cited that case as evidence that the approach could work in crypto markets, where assets are even easier to conceal once they leave regulated platforms. South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which took effect in July 2024, strengthened exchange obligations to monitor suspicious activity but did not grant preemptive asset freeze powers. A second legislative phase addressing stablecoins, market abuse, and enforcement gaps remains stalled in 2026 as the Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea dispute whether stablecoin issuers should be bank-led consortia. Beyond trading enforcement, authorities are tightening compliance across exchanges. The Financial Intelligence Unit imposed a 27.3 billion won fine on Korbit in December following 22,000 anti-money laundering violations, after earlier sanctions against Upbit totaling 35.2 billion won. South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit fines crypto exchange Korbit $1.89M over violations. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/fqGj3jWHWF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 31, 2025 Bithumb, Coinone, and GOPAX remain under review, with total sector fines expected to reach hundreds of billions of won. A lawyer experienced in virtual asset litigation told The Chosun Daily the ruling “ clarifies the legal nature of coins stored and traded on virtual asset exchanges and specifies that they can be lawfully seized during investigations ,” adding that it should “ resolve practical controversies and doubts related to seizure searches of exchanges. “ Amid all these, South Korea has simultaneously advanced initiatives to legitimize crypto markets. Korea Exchange chairman Jeong Eun-bo announced plans earlier this month to launch crypto ETFs and extend trading hours to 24/7 operations, while the government also recently abolished a seven-year venture capital funding ban for crypto firms.

French tax agents may have exposed crypto owners, increasing the number of physical attacks. As tax authorities gain more knowledge of crypto ownership, they may become a source of information leaks, both unintended and deliberate. French media reported on a tax agent who may have deliberately exposed the data of crypto owners. The former French tax agent Ghalia C. recently appealed her sentence for aiding organized crime. She was investigated for exposing the details of a prison guard, and may have shared data on crypto ownership. The 32-year-old Ghalia C. was imprisoned on June 30, 2025, and remained in custody for complicity in violence against a prison officer and criminal conspiracy. Tax agent searched for high-profile crypto owners The French tax agent was mostly investigated for the actual attack against an exposed prison guard’s phone. However, her history included searches for public figures and cryptocurrency investors. There are no reports on a planned attack on crypto owners, but the case opens the door to the potential for tax-based leaks. Additional reports show Ghalia C. may have used her access to confidential tax authority databases to compile profiles of potential targets, including cryptocurrency owners. The research targeted public crypto specialists, but may have exposed even private owners with data on location, as well as capital gains on crypto. Crypto exposure leads to more physical attacks France was one of the hotspots for repeated attacks against crypto owners. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, the crime was becoming more organized and repeated as a pattern. Crypto ownership became mainstream, while European citizens doubled their exposure between 2022 and 2024. At the same time, tax authorities required more reporting and tying on-chain addresses to identities with full KYC data. Proposals for new laws on taxing wealth will include reporting on crypto holdings above 5,000 EUR. Even new buyers from the past couple of years with exposure to BTC may have seen their assets appreciate above the threshold. Tax authorities are also seeking the declaration of crypto funds above a certain threshold, essentially creating a database of ownership tied to personal and tax information. The discovery of the tax authority leak follows the recent exposure of data from Global-e, the payment processor for Ledger. Known crypto owners, especially with links to emails, can become the target for both physical attacks and phishing or scam attempts. France also plans to tax crypto holdings above 2M EUR at 1% annually, including those held in self-custodial or offshore wallets. Crypto ownership is still reported voluntarily, but any attempt to use a centralized platform may connect wallets to an identity. The attempts to track crypto ownership have led to a growing demand for mixers, as well as confidentiality assets. Additionally, tax authorities may demand payments based on unrealized capital gains, causing long-term holders to sell and cover their costs. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

At the same time, Wood said crypto is still strategically important for Donald Trump ahead of midterm elections and suggested the administration may eventually begin actively purchasing Bitcoin for a national reserve, moving beyond its current reliance on seized assets. VanEck Predicts $2.9 Million Bitcoin Bitcoin could reach $2.9 million by 2050 if it turns into a widely used settlement currency for global trade and becomes part of central bank reserve portfolios. This is according to analysts at asset manager VanEck. The forecast assumes a 15% compounded annual growth rate and is based on Bitcoin settling between 5% and 10% of global international trade, as well as 5% of domestic trade, by mid-century. The projection was shared by VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, and senior investment analyst Patrick Bush. Bitcoin prediction from VanEck analysts The analysts argue that Bitcoin’s long-term value is less dependent on short-term price movements and more tied to its role as a hedge against structural weaknesses in the global financial system. They described Bitcoin not as a tactical investment, but as a long-duration hedge against adverse monetary regime outcomes, driven by ongoing global liquidity expansion and monetary debasement. While short-term price action may be influenced by liquidity cycles and leverage, they believe long-term value accrual will come from Bitcoin’s alignment with the growing strain on sovereign debt systems. Under VanEck’s base-case scenario, central banks could eventually allocate up to 2.5% of their total assets to Bitcoin. At a price of $2.9 million, Bitcoin will represent about 1.66% of total global financial assets. The firm also shared alternative outcomes, including a bear case that assumes a 2% CAGR, which would place Bitcoin closer to $130,000 by 2050, and a bull case that assumes a 20% CAGR, resulting in a price as high as $52.4 million. BTC price action over the past 5 years (Source: CoinCodex ) Bitcoin is already being used in global trade in certain regions, particularly in sanctioned countries like Venezuela, Iran, and Russia, though adoption is still minimal among G7 economies. VanEck’s model suggests that if Bitcoin were to capture a 5% to 10% share of international trade settlement, it will be used at a level comparable to major fiat currencies today. Data from SWIFT shows that the U.S. dollar accounted for 47.8% of international trade as of September 2025, followed by the euro at 22.8% and the British pound at 7.4%. The Japanese yen and Chinese yuan followed with shares of 3.7% and 3.2%, respectively. Under VanEck’s assumptions, Bitcoin’s trade usage would place it alongside the British pound in terms of global settlement relevance. Trump May Start Buying Bitcoin Meanwhile, Cathie Wood said crypto is still a politically important issue for Donald Trump as he approaches midterm elections, which could affect the development of a US Bitcoin reserve. Speaking on a recent episode of the Bitcoin Brainstorm podcast , Wood suggested the federal government may soon move beyond simply holding seized digital assets and begin actively purchasing Bitcoin for a national strategic reserve that was established by executive order early in Trump’s second term. Wood said that, so far, the reserve has only consisted of Bitcoins that were seized through government forfeitures, and Trump pledged not to sell. She said there has been hesitation around outright purchases, but explained that the original goal behind the reserve was to eventually accumulate as many as one million Bitcoins. Based on that original intent, Wood said she expects the federal government to begin buying Bitcoin rather than relying solely on confiscated assets. According to Wood, Trump’s support for crypto is driven by both political and personal considerations. She pointed to his family’s growing exposure to the crypto industry and argued that the crypto community played a meaningful role in his electoral victory. Wood added that Trump is motivated to avoid becoming a lame-duck president and sees crypto policy as a way to deliver tangible progress during the remainder of his term. The crypto industry has become a major political force in recent election cycles. In addition to political action committees like Stand With Crypto, which donated heavily to candidates across the political spectrum, several well known industry figures publicly endorsed Trump and contributed directly to his campaign, including Wood herself. Crypto executives have also taken on a more visible role in Washington, with industry leaders offering policy input and the White House hosting events focused on digital assets. Major firms like Coinbase, Tether, and Ripple also contributed funding toward a new White House ballroom. While the bitcoin reserve currently functions primarily as a holding mechanism similar to how gold is treated as a strategic asset, the executive order from Trump directs the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral ways to add more Bitcoin. No such purchases have been made to date. Beyond reserve policy, Wood said the administration is likely to push for a de minimis tax exemption that would eliminate capital gains taxes on small crypto transactions.",News|Crypto,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

57006262,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260090,1767949811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $90,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-90000-7/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $90,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Shift Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant volatility today as Bitcoin, the world’s leading digital asset, fell below the crucial $90,000 psychological threshold. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC currently trades at $89,975 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable shift in market sentiment during early 2025 trading sessions. This development follows several weeks of relative stability above the $92,000 level, prompting analysts to examine underlying market dynamics and potential catalysts for the sudden price movement. Bitcoin Price Analysis and Current Market Position Market data reveals Bitcoin’s descent below $90,000 represents a 2.3% decline from yesterday’s closing price. Trading volume across major exchanges increased by approximately 18% during the downward movement, indicating heightened market activity. The Binance USDT pair specifically shows consistent selling pressure throughout the Asian trading session. Furthermore, other major exchanges including Coinbase and Kraken report similar price levels, confirming the broad market nature of this correction. Technical indicators suggest the $89,500 level now serves as immediate support, while resistance appears firmly established at $91,200. Historical context provides crucial perspective for this price movement. Bitcoin previously tested the $90,000 level three times during the fourth quarter of 2024, each time finding substantial buying support. The current breach therefore represents a significant technical development. Market analysts note that Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility index has increased from 2.8% to 3.4% over the past week, signaling returning market uncertainty. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s correlation with traditional equity markets has decreased slightly, suggesting crypto-specific factors may be driving current price action. Cryptocurrency Market Context and Contributing Factors Several interconnected factors appear to influence Bitcoin’s current price trajectory. First, broader cryptocurrency market capitalization declined by $42 billion over the past 24 hours, indicating sector-wide pressure rather than Bitcoin-specific weakness. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, similarly experienced a 2.1% decline during the same period. Second, regulatory developments in multiple jurisdictions have created uncertainty, particularly regarding proposed digital asset frameworks in European and Asian markets. Third, macroeconomic indicators including inflation data and interest rate expectations continue to impact risk asset valuations globally. The derivatives market provides additional insight into current sentiment. Bitcoin futures open interest decreased by approximately 7% across major platforms, suggesting some traders are reducing leveraged positions. Funding rates for perpetual swaps turned slightly negative on several exchanges, indicating increased bearish sentiment among derivatives traders. However, options market data shows continued demand for both call and put options at the $90,000 strike price, reflecting market uncertainty about near-term direction. These mixed signals highlight the complex nature of current market dynamics. Expert Perspectives on Market Movements Financial analysts emphasize the importance of distinguishing between short-term volatility and long-term trends. “Market corrections represent normal behavior in cryptocurrency markets,” notes Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Senior Market Analyst at Digital Asset Research Group. “The $90,000 level has served as both support and resistance multiple times, making its breach psychologically significant but not necessarily indicative of a broader trend reversal.” Historical data supports this perspective, showing Bitcoin has experienced 15 similar 2-3% single-day declines during 2024 alone, with most followed by recovery within subsequent trading sessions. Institutional investment patterns provide additional context for current market conditions. According to weekly fund flow data, cryptocurrency investment products experienced modest outflows of $28 million last week, reversing three consecutive weeks of inflows. However, long-term institutional holdings remain near all-time highs, with approximately 8.3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply held by publicly traded companies and exchange-traded products. This institutional presence creates a stabilizing influence that may limit downside volatility compared to previous market cycles. Technical Indicators and Market Structure Analysis Technical analysis reveals several key levels and patterns worth monitoring. The 50-day moving average currently sits at $88,500, providing potential support if downward pressure continues. Meanwhile, the 200-day moving average remains substantially lower at $76,200, indicating the long-term trend remains bullish despite recent weakness. On-chain metrics offer complementary insights, with the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least 1 BTC reaching a new all-time high of 1.12 million addresses this week, suggesting continued accumulation by smaller investors despite price volatility. Market structure analysis identifies several potential scenarios. First, a quick recovery above $90,000 would suggest the breach represented temporary market noise rather than meaningful technical breakdown. Second, consolidation between $88,000 and $90,000 would indicate market indecision and potential base formation. Third, a break below $88,000 would signal more substantial correction potential toward the next major support level around $85,000. Each scenario carries different implications for short-term traders and long-term investors, requiring careful risk management regardless of market direction. Historical Comparisons and Market Psychology Historical price action provides valuable context for understanding current market psychology. Bitcoin has experienced 14 separate declines of 5% or more since beginning its current bull market phase in late 2023, with the average recovery time being 8.3 trading days. The largest correction during this period measured 12.4% over three weeks before resuming its upward trajectory. These historical patterns suggest that while corrections can feel dramatic in real-time, they typically represent normal market behavior within broader trends. Market sentiment indicators currently show a shift from “greed” to “neutral” territory according to several established metrics, potentially creating healthier conditions for sustainable price appreciation. Global adoption metrics continue to show positive long-term trends despite short-term price volatility. The number of active Bitcoin addresses has increased by 18% year-over-year, while transaction volume measured in dollar terms has grown by 42% during the same period. Lightning Network capacity, measuring Bitcoin’s layer-2 scaling solution, reached new all-time highs last month, indicating continued infrastructure development. These fundamental metrics suggest underlying network strength that may support price recovery despite current market uncertainty. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $90,000 represents a significant technical development within the broader context of cryptocurrency market evolution. While short-term volatility creates trading opportunities and challenges, long-term fundamentals including adoption metrics, institutional participation, and technological development continue to show positive trends. Market participants should monitor key support levels around $88,500 and resistance near $91,200 for indications of next directional movement. As always in cryptocurrency markets, prudent risk management and diversified exposure remain essential strategies for navigating periods of increased volatility. The Bitcoin price movement below $90,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market dynamics while highlighting the importance of perspective when evaluating short-term price action against long-term trends. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $90,000? Multiple factors contributed including broader market volatility, regulatory uncertainty in several jurisdictions, and technical selling pressure after Bitcoin failed to maintain support above $91,000. Market-wide cryptocurrency capitalization declined simultaneously, indicating sector-wide rather than Bitcoin-specific factors. Q2: How significant is the $90,000 price level for Bitcoin? The $90,000 level represents both a psychological threshold and a technical support/resistance zone that Bitcoin has tested multiple times. Its breach carries psychological significance for market participants but doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal given Bitcoin’s history of volatility around round-number levels. Q3: What are the key support levels if Bitcoin continues to decline? Immediate support appears around $89,500, followed by stronger support at the 50-day moving average near $88,500. Below that, significant support exists at $85,000 based on previous consolidation patterns and institutional buying interest at that level during late 2024. Q4: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? The current 2.3% decline represents a relatively modest correction compared to Bitcoin’s historical volatility. Since late 2023, Bitcoin has experienced 14 separate declines of 5% or more, with an average recovery time of approximately 8 trading days, suggesting current movement falls within normal market parameters. Q5: What should investors monitor following this price movement? Key indicators include trading volume patterns, institutional fund flows, regulatory developments, and broader market sentiment. Technical levels to watch include the $88,500 support and $91,200 resistance, while on-chain metrics like active addresses and exchange balances may provide additional insight into market dynamics.

The Benner Cycle , also known as the “Periods When to Make Money” chart, is a 150-year-old market forecasting tool that has gained renewed attention for identifying 2026 as a critical market peak. Created by Samuel Benner in 1875 , this cyclical model suggests that the global economy follows a rhythmic pattern of booms and busts tied to agricultural and solar cycles. As of early 2026 , the chart categorizes the current year as a time of “Good Times” and high prices, issuing a clear historical signal to sell assets before a predicted downturn begins. What Is the History and Methodology of the Benner Cycle? Samuel Benner , a prosperous Ohio farmer who was wiped out financially during the Panic of 1873 , developed the chart to understand the causes of market fluctuations. He theorized that market cycles were not random but followed predictable patterns driven by solar activity and its effect on crop yields (specifically pig iron, corn, and hogs). The chart divides economic history into three distinct repeating phases: A – Panic Years: Periods characterized by extreme fear, market crashes, and panic selling (e.g., historical markers like 1927, 1999, and the prediction for 2019). B – Good Times: Years defined by prosperity, high asset prices, and exuberant market sentiment. This is the designated window to sell stocks and real estate . C – Hard Times: Eras of low prices and economic stagnation. Benner identified these as the optimal times to buy and hold assets cheaply. How Accurate Has the Benner Cycle Been Over the Last 150 Years? The Benner Cycle is often described as “eerily accurate” by financial historians, though it is not without flaws. Its long-term track record includes several major successful predictions that keep it relevant in modern technical analysis. Major Hits: The chart correctly identified the 1929 stock market crash , the 1999 Dot-com bubble peak , the 2007 pre-crash high before the Global Financial Crisis, and the “Hard Times” buying window of 2023 . Notable Misses: The cycle is not infallible. It predicted a panic year in 2019 , but the actual market crash did not occur until the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, representing a one-year deviation. Additionally, it forecasted “Hard Times” during 1965 , which was actually a year of robust economic growth. What Does the Benner Cycle Predict for 2026? In the context of 2026 , the Benner Cycle is interpreted as a major warning signal for investors holding risk assets. The “Good Times” Peak: 2026 is labeled as a Category B year. This indicates a period of peak market sentiment and high prices, suggesting that the market will reach its zenith in late 2026 or early 2027 . The “Sell” Signal: The explicit instruction from the chart for this phase is to take profits . The cycle suggests that following this peak, the economy will enter a “Hard Times” phase that could potentially last until 2032 , making capital preservation a priority. Cryptocurrency Alignment: Modern crypto analysts have noted a strong correlation between the Benner Cycle and the Bitcoin halving cycles. Many forecast that the 2026 peak aligns with a post-halving high for Bitcoin (with estimates reaching $250,000 ) before a severe cyclical correction. Solar Cycle Correlation: The prediction is further supported by modern data on solar activity , which is forecast to peak in the 2025–2026 window, aligning with Benner’s original thesis that solar intensity influences economic productivity and psychology. Frequently Asked Questions Is the Benner Cycle reliable for predicting stock market crashes? While the Benner Cycle has an impressive track record—accurately calling the 1929 and 2008 crashes—it should not be used as a standalone indicator. It is a long-term cyclical map rather than a precise daily trading tool, and it has had deviations, such as the one-year lag between the predicted 2019 panic and the actual 2020 COVID crash. What should I do with my investments in 2026 according to the chart? According to the Benner Cycle , 2026 is a “Good Times” year, which is the specific phase where investors are advised to sell and liquidate assets to lock in high prices. The chart warns that holding assets beyond this peak exposes investors to the subsequent “Hard Times” phase of deflation and low prices. How does the Benner Cycle relate to Bitcoin in 2026? Although Samuel Benner created the chart in 1875 well before cryptocurrency existed, modern analysts use it to track Bitcoin’s 4-year market cycles. The 2026 “Good Times” prediction aligns with the expected parabolic top of the crypto market following the 2024 halving, suggesting a major top for digital assets this year. Conclusion The Benner Cycle serves as a fascinating and historically weighty lens through which to view the 2026 financial markets . By categorizing 2026 as a peak year of “Good Times,” it offers a contrarian signal to widespread bullishness, urging investors to consider taking profits before a potential long-term downturn.

As of January 9, 2026 , these metrics remain the gold standard for defining market sentiment, helping investors distinguish between temporary price noise and significant structural shifts. This guide explains how these specific timeframes work, their role in generating buy/sell signals like the Golden Cross , and how to use them for dynamic risk management. How Do the 50, 100, and 200-Day Moving Averages Differ? Moving averages (MAs) are calculated by summing the closing prices of an asset over a specific number of days and dividing by that count. The difference lies in their sensitivity and the “horizon” of the trend they reveal. 50-Day MA (Short-to-Medium Term): This indicator tracks the average price over the last roughly 2.5 months. It is highly sensitive to recent price changes, making it the preferred tool for analyzing short-term momentum and immediate market sentiment. 100-Day MA (Medium Term): Averaging price action over the last 100 days, this MA serves as a bridge between short-term volatility and the broader market view. It is often used to gauge the strength of a trend once the initial hype has settled. 200-Day MA (Long Term): Representing roughly 40 weeks of data, the 200-day MA is the most widely watched indicator by institutional investors. It acts as the definitive “line in the sand” for the overall market bias; price action above it is considered bullish , while trading below it indicates a bearish winter. Why Are Moving Averages Crucial for Crypto Strategy? In the 24/7 cryptocurrency market, moving averages provide clarity amidst chaos. They are not just lines on a chart but actionable tools for defining entry and exit points. Trend Identification: The simplest rule in trading is relative positioning. If a crypto asset is trading consistently above its moving averages, it is in a confirmed uptrend. Conversely, price action trapped below suggests a downtrend. Dynamic Support and Resistance: Unlike static horizontal lines, MAs move with the price. In an uptrend, the 50-day or 200-day MA often acts as a “floor” (support) where traders look to buy the dip. In a downtrend, these lines act as a “ceiling” (resistance) where rallies often face rejection. Signal Generation (Crossovers): Golden Cross: A potent buy signal occurring when a shorter-term MA (typically the 50-day ) crosses above a longer-term MA (the 200-day ). This signals the start of a potential long-term bull market. Death Cross: The opposite pattern, where the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA , indicating impending long-term bearishness. Risk Management: disciplined traders use the distance between the current price and key MAs to set stop-loss orders , helping to manage position sizing and protect capital during volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between a Golden Cross and a Death Cross? A Golden Cross is a bullish breakout signal that happens when a short-term moving average (like the 50-day) crosses above a long-term one (like the 200-day), suggesting upward momentum. A Death Cross is the exact opposite: a bearish signal indicating that short-term momentum has fallen below the long-term average, often preceding a significant market correction. Which moving average is best for long-term crypto holding? For long-term investors or “HODLers,” the 200-day moving average is considered the most reliable indicator. It filters out daily and weekly noise, providing a clear view of the asset’s macro health; historically, buying when Bitcoin is above its 200-day MA has been a strategy for capturing major cycle uptrends. Why are moving averages called “lagging indicators”? Moving averages are classified as lagging indicators because they are calculated using historical price data. They confirm trends that have already begun rather than predicting future price moves instantly, meaning traders should use them in conjunction with leading indicators (like RSI or volume) for the most accurate decision-making. Conclusion Mastering the 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages is essential for navigating the complexities of the 2026 cryptocurrency market . By providing objective data on trend direction and critical support levels, these indicators allow traders to make decisions based on structural market behavior rather than emotional impulse. Whether you are looking to spot the next Golden Cross or simply define your risk tolerance, integrating these tools into your strategy is a vital step toward professional trading consistency.

More downside on Friday might see this level tested again. Can it continue to hold? One more retest of the bull flag? Source: TradingView After the $90,000 horizontal support level held on Thursday, in spite of strong attempts by the bears to break it (as witnessed by the candle wicks that came down through this level), it might have been expected that a bounce would have taken the price back to the top of the bull flag. None of it. The bounce took the price a short way up to the $91,500 horizontal resistance, and a fairly strong rejection took place there. Currently, the $BTC price is on its way back down to the already hotly contested $90,000 level, either to retest it, or for the bears to have yet another shot at breaking through it. If the bears are successful, the major trendline, combined with the $88,000 horizontal support, could be the next target. Retest is happening Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it can be seen that things are moving quickly on Friday morning. Already the $BTC price has dipped to the level of the bottom of the bull flag, which is below the $90,000 horizontal support. Is the price going to carry on down to the major trendline and nullify the bull flag? If on the other hand the bulls manage to arrest the slide and there is a bounce from here, there wouldn’t really be any harm done, and the daily Stochastic RSI indicators would have come down further. On this note, all the short-term time frame Stochastic RSI indicators have bottomed now, so upside price momentum is getting ready to kick in. Clear path to $108,000 if breakout occurs Source: TradingView Looking at the weekly time frame one can note that the $BTC price has indeed bounced and is already back at the $90,000 support level. Perhaps this was one last fakeout to cause any last doubters to sell their positions before the price goes higher. The green ascending triangle is certainly a pattern to be keeping an eye on. With a potential switch over to bullish price action going into the weekend, a breakout is certainly a decent probability. If the price does breakout, either at the weekend or going into next week, it can be observed that there is a clear path to the very important $108,000 horizontal resistance. There will probably be a pause around the $100,000 level, but if one looks for solid price structure, this is to be found further up at that key $108,000 level. If the price gets there, this level is likely to have a say in whether this current upside move has legs, or whether it is just a bear market rally.

At the same time, a separate weekly framework circulating on X suggests a relief rally remains possible if momentum continues to recover. Bitcoin Slips Below $90,000 Ahead of Key U.S. Data and Court Decision Bitcoin fell back below the $90,000 level on Jan. 9 as markets turned cautious ahead of two closely watched U.S. events scheduled later in the day. Price weakness unfolded during the European session and extended into early U.S. hours, reflecting a broader risk-off tone across crypto markets. On the 30-minute BTC/USDT spot chart from Bybit, Bitcoin showed a clear short-term downtrend. Price continued to post lower highs and lower lows after failing to hold rebounds near the $91,500–$92,000 area. Sellers regained control during the latest leg down, pushing Bitcoin to around $89,900 at the time of the chart snapshot. The structure suggests fading momentum after several failed recovery attempts since Jan. 7. Bitcoin USDT Spot 30 Minute Chart. Source: TradingView Bybit / X Market attention is now centered on the U.S. unemployment report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Labor data often acts as a trigger for volatility across risk assets, including crypto, because it shapes expectations around Federal Reserve policy. A stronger-than-expected report could reinforce the case for tighter financial conditions, while weaker data may revive rate-cut expectations later in the year. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s failure to reclaim the $90,500–$91,000 zone keeps short-term pressure intact. The recent bounce attempts lacked follow-through, and price slipped back toward the lower end of the week’s range. As a result, traders appear hesitant to take aggressive positions ahead of the day’s events. Overall, Bitcoin’s dip below $90,000 reflects caution rather than panic. Price action suggests markets are waiting for confirmation from U.S. data and legal developments before committing to a clearer directional move. Bitcoin relief rally framework stays intact on weekly chart Bitcoin continues to follow a longer-term structure on the weekly BTCUSDT Binance chart that Titan of Crypto says has remained valid for months. The chart plots price against a smooth red trend line that has acted as a cycle guide, with several historical turning points forming when candles met that curve and then reversed. Bitcoin TetherUS Weekly Chart. Source: TradingView Binance / X Earlier sections of the chart show similar behavior. After extended pullbacks, Bitcoin rebounded toward the red line, paused, and then either rolled over or continued depending on momentum conditions. These repeated reactions form the basis of the relief rally framework shared earlier, which still appears respected by current price action. Momentum signals come from the Stoch RSI panel at the bottom. The indicator recently dipped into a low region highlighted in green, matching previous cycle lows that preceded short-term rebounds. In those past cases, momentum recovery supported upside relief moves while the broader trend remained intact. The framework highlights the red line area as the next key decision zone. That region has historically acted as resistance or support during trend transitions. As a result, the setup suggests that direction becomes clearer once price either reclaims the curve or fails near it, keeping the relief rally scenario in focus without signaling a confirmed trend shift.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

BTC 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold The situation is made even more uncertain by the presence of both bullish and bearish factors in the early 2026 market. On the one hand, the start of January featured notable institutional selling, and spot BTC exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) have seen more days of outflows than inflows since the New Year. Specifically, Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.16 billion inflows in the first days of 2026 but then faced $1.12 billion outflows, reflecting fragile institutional sentiment. Indeed, January 6, 7, and 8 have all been net selling days with more than 400 Bitcoins exiting the system, per the data Finbold retrieved from Coinglass. On the other hand, there is no shortage of potential bullish catalysts, as global political instability could render BTC a particularly enticing investment – especially with gold made somewhat unattractive due to its exceptionally high price , and as the domestic political climate in the U.S. is especially positive. In the hopes of piercing the uncertainty, Finbold consulted the advanced artificial intelligence ( AI ) of ChatGPT about where the world’s premier cryptocurrency could find itself on January 31. ChatGPT sets January Bitcoin price target Despite the many potential catalysts, the AI model offered a highly conservative and slightly bullish price target for Bitcoin on January 31. Specifically, ChatGPT estimated that the cryptocurrency is likely to rise and trade at $92,000 at the end of the month. According to the AI, such a forecast reflects the latest pullback, but also the general momentum – which it described as ‘consolidative, not impulsive’ – behind digital assets. Indeed, it claimed that ‘boring, sticky price action wins January.’ ChatGPT sets Bitcoin price target for January 31. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT When inquired about the rest of 2026, ChatGPT proved decidedly bullish. The advanced large language model (LLM) announced that it considers continued institutional backing a likely trend, while opining the year will feature a climate of moderately lower interest rates in which BTC moves from being a risk asset and toward becoming ‘digital hard money.’ ChatGPT also explained that, in 2026, the post-halving cycle remains important, but that it shall not be as ‘explosive’ as in 2017 or 2021. ChatGPT sets Bitcoin price target for 2026.

The broader crypto market remains range-bound, with traders now watching macro events rather than chasing direction . Why does this moment matter? Over the next 24 hours, attention centers on a potential U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the legality of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Markets across equities, bonds, and crypto now prepare for a volatility test. What the Supreme Court Decision Involves The Supreme Court may rule on whether the administration can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs. The court could also decide whether importers deserve reimbursement for duties already paid. Analysts expect a nuanced outcome rather than a clear win or loss. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has already described the likely decision as a “mishmash,” reflecting the wide range of possible interpretations. Even if the court limits tariff authority, the administration retains other legal tools, including provisions under the 1962 Trade Act. This uncertainty keeps markets alert. Investors now weigh how changes in trade policy could influence growth, inflation, and fiscal conditions at the same time. Why Tariffs Matter for Bitcoin and Crypto Tariffs influence inflation expectations, interest rate outlooks and global liquidity conditions. These factors shape risk appetite across all asset classes. When inflation risks rise, bond yields often follow, tightening financial conditions. Crypto assets, including Bitcoin, tend to react to these shifts through changes in leverage, funding rates, and capital flows. If the ruling weakens tariff enforcement, markets could price in lower input costs and smoother trade. That scenario could ease inflation concerns while supporting corporate earnings. If the court allows tariffs to stand , investors may reassess growth and rate expectations. Either outcome can trigger short-term volatility across crypto markets. The direction matters less than the reaction quality. Does price action stabilize or fragment under pressure? On-Chain Metrics Signal Market Fragility On-chain indicators provide insight beyond headlines. The Spent Output Profit Ratio, or SOPR, stands out as a key signal. When SOPR holds above 1, profit-taking supports price action. When it hovers near 1 during rebounds, selling pressure often dominates. Source: CryptoQuant Current conditions show SOPR struggling to sustain a clean move above that level, which points to fragile upside momentum. Exchange Inflow data adds context. Rising inflows during price recoveries suggest that holders move assets to sell-ready positions. This behavior often reflects caution rather than fresh demand. Source: CryptoQuant If inflows rise around the court decision, volatility could intensify through position adjustments rather than organic buying. What to Watch After the Ruling Market structure will reveal the real story after the ruling. Declining exchange inflows combined with SOPR stabilizing above 1 would suggest improving conditions and lower volatility risk. In contrast, rising inflows alongside weak SOPR would signal ongoing instability. For now, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market appear set for elevated short-term volatility, with prices likely to remain range-bound until clearer confirmation emerges.

In its report, the bank’s analysts, led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted, “Signs of a bottoming out in January are also seen in other crypto indicators in perpetual futures and in our position proxies on CME futures.” In December, several investors pulled funds from Bitcoin and Ethereum, but at the same time, equity ETFs enjoyed their largest-ever monthly inflows of $235 billion globally. That difference, the bank noted, reflected a significant pullback in crypto exposure by investors as the year drew to a close. However, this January, multiple indicators suggest that the digital assets market is starting to stabilize. JPMorgan analysts say MSCI’s move may improve market stability According to current ETF data, JPMorgan believes that both retail and institutional investors may have largely completed the position reductions. It wrote, “Taken together, all these indicators suggest that the previous crypto position reduction by both retail and institutional investors during the last quarter of 2025 is likely behind us.” The analysts added that MSCI’s decision to include crypto-related firms in its February 2026 benchmarks could largely help reinforce market stability. They contended that although MSCI intends to reassess these companies later, the current move could provide firms like Strategy with some short-term relief and diminish the likelihood of mandatory selling caused by index changes. Additionally, speaking about what drove crypto’s decline in the fourth quarter of last year, the analysts said that while deteriorating liquidity is always a factor, it was “most likely not” the cause of the recent correction. They pointed to metrics such as market breadth and the impact of trading volumes on CME bitcoin futures and bitcoin ETFs, concluding that liquidity issues likely didn’t cause the decline. They explained the crypto market correction was primarily driven by de-risking following MSCI’s October 10 announcement on Strategy. They added, “The good news is that there are signs of stabilisation and bottoming out in crypto flow and positioning indicators in January, suggesting that the previous position reduction by investors is largely behind us.” Bitwise CIO says crypto players have moved past the October 10 liquidation event Recently, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan asserted that three conditions must be met for digital assets to reach new record levels this year, and one may already be at play. He noted that after the market shock on October 10, investors were concerned that big hedge funds could be forced to sell, resulting in continued downward pressure. However, he said such fears seem to be subsiding, as significant position cuts are likely to have occurred before the end of the year, and early 2026 market performance indicates that the overhang is no longer dragging on investors. Additionally, Hougan said the CLARITY Act , currently moving through Congress, represents just part of what still needs to happen legislatively, adding that its passage would be a key milestone. He said a stable stock market backdrop is also crucial for crypto, but added that, though there isn’t a clear correlation, a steep selloff in the S&P 500 could pressure risk assets broadly. Currently, markets indicate a low probability of a recession and favorable odds for equities, but the risk cannot be entirely ruled out. Overall, digital assets’ future is looking good, with the rise in institutional interest, stablecoins, and tokenization markets growing, and the delayed benefits of a more favorable regulatory shift that began in early 2025 manifesting. Bitwise expects crypto’s early-year strength to continue as long as policy developments stay on track and broader markets perform well. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The price action has cooled after a rapid drop, while traders watch key levels to gauge the next move. 3-Day MACD Falls to Record Low Michaël van de Poppe, a market analyst, noted that Bitcoin’s recent decline triggered a new low on the 3-day MACD indicator. He stated that this drop “ was heavier than the 2022 Luna crash, the 2020 COVID crash, or the 2018 bear market. ” #Bitcoin has seen its heaviest crash in the history of the asset. The MACD on the 3-Day has never been going this far down. The crash was heavier than 2022 Luna Crash, 2020 COVID Crash, or the 2018 bear market. If you’re buying during those times, every time you’re ending up… pic.twitter.com/nhgT4Rn075 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 8, 2026 The MACD, which tracks momentum, has fallen further than in any past cycle. It reflects a sharp reversal from highs near $126,000 in October 2025 to a recent low just above $85,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $90,000 (per CoinGecko data). Despite the scale of the drop, the chart still shows a series of higher lows compared to past bear market bottoms. This has kept some long-term bullish structure in place, though short-term sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin dropped from over $94,600 on Monday to below $89,300 on Thursday. It has mostly stayed between $85,000 and $90,000. This range has held for several weeks, suggesting a pause in selling but no clear direction yet. Moreover, Van de Poppe described the current phase as one of “ boredom ,” noting Bitcoin is holding above the 21-day moving average. He added, “ Nothing to worry, ” if this support continues to hold. His chart shows the price hovering near $90,500 with a rising trendline below, giving bulls some ground to defend. Crucial Levels to Watch for Bitcoin At the moment, Bitcoin is in a neutral zone. To get the upward momentum, it has to move above 92,000. In case that level is not regained, the price may drift down to around $88,000, where there is a CME gap to be closed. Analyst Ali Martinez warned , “Bitcoin must hold above $87,200 to avoid a drop toward $69,230.” His daily chart shows a rising triangle structure, but with a recent rejection at $92,750. A break below the lower trendline would cancel the pattern and shift bias to the downside. Some market participants point to dealer hedging as a reason for the tight price range. As CryptoPotato reported , large players are reportedly selling into price spikes and buying on dips, which keeps Bitcoin trading between $90,000 and $95,000. Strong resistance remains around the $100,000 mark. The post Worse Than the Covid Crash?

According to a joint press release on Friday, this change is about turning crypto into something fund managers can actually use without having to cross their fingers. “This is the combination of two gold standards to deliver the regulated diversification and foundational building block the market now demands,” said Giovanni Vicioso, who runs equity and alternative products at CME Group. Sean Wasserman, who leads index product management at Nasdaq, said it’s happening because the rules around crypto are finally starting to make sense. “Now that we are starting to see regulatory clarity coming to the treatment of crypto assets, particularly in the U.S., the door has been opened for industry participants to bring to the crypto asset class the types of regulated investment solutions that investors rely on every day.” Nasdaq and CME team up again after three decades of working together Nasdaq and CME Group have been building markets together since the ’90s. They kicked things off with Nasdaq-100 Index futures in 1996, then brought in E-mini contracts by 1999. They’ve kept going since then. Just this year, they renewed their Nasdaq-100 license for another 10 years. This new crypto index builds right on top of that same playbook. “This announcement reflects how Nasdaq and CME Group are looking to bring their collective experience in markets and indexing to the crypto asset class,” said Sean. But they’re not doing it alone. CF Benchmarks is in charge of calculating the numbers, and the index is backed by vetted exchanges and custodians. A joint governance group watches over everything to make sure it meets today’s compliance standards. The whole methodology is public. That includes what goes in the index, what gets removed, and how often the list changes. Index will be used to launch ETFs and structured crypto funds Sean then compared the whole thing to how traditional indexes are used in other markets, meaning they’re never about one coin or one company but the entire market; every corner of it. That’s where this index is headed, according to him. CME Group is backing this with its own track record. They launched the first regulated Bitcoin futures in 2017 and helped build a functioning price discovery setup for crypto. “Our crypto derivatives are what provide a regulated and liquid market for price discovery,” said Giovanni. This index is already being used in real products. One of them is the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (ticker: NCIQ), which tracks multiple coins. It’s managed by Hashdex, a crypto asset firm with over $1 billion under management across the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. “We’re really talking about establishing it as an asset class. Even a one to five percent allocation as part of a wider portfolio mix is a huge opportunity from an adoption standpoint,” Sean promised . If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/developer-opportunity-to-make-more-money-is-greater-with-xrp-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Crypto markets reward those who understand timing, structure, and scale. As prices fluctuate and narratives shift, investors increasingly focus on where capital can work hardest rather than which asset feels safest. In this environment, discussions around upside potential matter more than ever, especially as large-cap cryptocurrencies mature and smaller assets position themselves for accelerated growth. That perspective recently gained traction after commentary from XRPL developer Bird (@Bird_XRPL), who offered a capital-efficiency argument comparing Bitcoin and XRP. His view does not challenge Bitcoin’s dominance or credibility. Instead, it reframes the conversation around realistic return potential when investors deploy the same amount of money into assets with vastly different market structures. You will make more money with XRP Why? Simple maths. Put $5,000 into Bitcoin today and it needs to run to ~$180,000 just for you to double to $10,000. Put $5,000 into XRP and when it reaches $10, that same $5,000 becomes $25,000. Same money. Very different upside. This is… — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 7, 2026 Market Size and Capital Efficiency Bitcoin commands the largest market capitalization in the cryptocurrency market, which lends it stability and institutional appeal. However, that size also creates gravity. As Bitcoin grows, it requires increasingly massive capital inflows to produce the same percentage gains seen in earlier cycles. Investors still benefit from appreciation, but exponential returns become statistically harder over time. XRP operates under a different dynamic. With a lower price per unit and a significantly smaller valuation relative to Bitcoin, XRP responds more sharply to incremental demand. This structural reality explains why equal investments can yield dramatically different outcomes, even when both assets move upward. XRP’s Utility-Driven Growth Narrative XRP’s upside discussion extends beyond price mechanics. The asset plays a central role in Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure , which focuses on inefficiencies in global money movement. Financial institutions continue to explore blockchain-based settlement, and XRPL development remains active across payments, tokenization, and decentralized applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This utility-driven narrative gives XRP a functional use case rather than relying solely on speculative momentum. As adoption expands, demand pressure can translate into price appreciation more rapidly due to XRP’s market position. Risk Awareness Without Ignoring Opportunity Every crypto investment carries risk, and XRP is no exception. Market volatility, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory sensitivity continue to influence price behavior. However, investors seeking asymmetric returns often accept higher volatility in exchange for greater upside potential. Bird’s argument resonates because it focuses on probability rather than prediction. He highlights how market math favors assets that sit earlier on the valuation curve when adoption and liquidity increase. Why the Comparison Matters The comparison between Bitcoin and XRP does not suggest one asset replaces the other. Instead, it underscores how opportunity shifts as markets evolve. Bitcoin offers durability and long-term confidence, while XRP presents leverage to growth. For investors prioritizing return potential over sheer size, the logic remains straightforward. When the same capital is invested into assets at different stages of maturity, the results rarely look the same.

The move places Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets firmly within the country’s national tax framework and shows a shift from partial disclosure to full transactional transparency. Colombia Sets 2027 Deadline for First Nationwide Crypto Reports Under Resolution 000240 , issued by the Directorate of National Tax and Customs (DIAN) in late December 2025, Colombia has formally adopted the OECD’s Cryptoasset Reporting Framework. Source: DIAN The rules require crypto exchanges, intermediaries, and other service providers operating in or serving Colombian residents to carry out enhanced due diligence and automatically share user and transaction data with tax authorities, including for international information exchanges. Local outlet CriptoNoticias first reported the details of the resolution, saying the regulation applies from the 2026 tax year, with the first large-scale reporting deadline set for May 2027. Answering that, each platform will be expected to provide detailed reports on all crypto activity performed in 2026. This involves information on account ownership, transaction volumes, transactions on tokens moved, and the market value of each operation involving bitcoin, ether, and popular stablecoins, like the USDT and USDC. Even though in 2025 the resolution was already in effect as of December 24, the first complete observation period will be in 2026. From DIAN’s perspective, every transaction executed by Colombian users during the year will be logged by service providers and prepared for electronic submission. Authorities have made clear that crypto activity will no longer be treated as opaque or informal within the tax system. The scope of the reporting obligation is broad, as it covers both domestic and foreign platforms serving Colombian residents, regardless of whether they hold a specific crypto license. Rising Crypto Adoption Meets Tougher Tax Rules in Colombia Colombia does not yet have a comprehensive licensing regime for crypto exchanges, and digital assets are still classified as intangible assets rather than legal tender. However, exchanges operating in the country are already expected to comply with general tax, anti-money laundering, and know-your-customer rules . One provision likely to draw particular attention from retail users is the monitoring of large payments and transfers. Transactions exceeding $50,000 will trigger automatic alerts to DIAN. Even below that threshold, platforms must report users’ tax residence information and net balances, excluding commissions, through standardized XML files processed electronically by the tax authority. Penalties for non-compliance are significant, with companies that fail to report, or submit incomplete or incorrect data, facing fines of up to 1% of the value of the unreported transactions. Legal experts have warned that the reporting calendar leaves little room for error, effectively making transparency a mandatory cost of doing business in Colombia’s crypto market. For users, the immediate impact is a loss of practical anonymity. While individuals were already required to declare crypto holdings as part of their income or wealth tax filings, enforcement previously relied largely on self-reporting. DIAN will now be able to cross-check exchange data against individual tax declarations, increasing scrutiny of the origin of funds and capital gains. The crackdown comes as crypto adoption in Colombia reaches new highs. Chainalysis data in October shows that the country recorded $44.2 billion in crypto transaction volume between July 2024 and June 2025, ranking fifth in Latin America. Source: Chainalysis This makes it the region’s second-fastest-growing market by value received. As of late 2025, Colombia is estimated to have about 10.72 million crypto users, representing nearly 19% of the population.

Specifically, the profile designated 0x8dxd has made an additional 700 predictions between January 6 and press time on January 9, increasing its one-month profits from $438,000 to nearly $512,000, and its all-time profits to over $550,000 on the prediction market. Polymarket statistics for 0x8dxd. Source: Polymarket Furthermore, the trading bot’s strategy appears, for the time being, unchanged as it has continued making directional bets for major cryptocurrencies with the most common predictions ‘objects’ being Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and XRP . Previously, it has been suspected that the system leverages the slight lag between the data from major digital assets exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase to place its bets after the likely outcome has been revealed, but Polymarket’s odds are still priced as being at approximately 50:50. Polymarket unveils new 15-minute market fees Still, it is worth noting that it remains uncertain if the strategy can be replicated given the announced changes to Polymarket. Additionally, it is possible that the trading bot could soon become significantly less profitable. Indeed, the prediction market unveiled that it shall be collecting additional fees only in 15-minute crypto markets and that it will redistribute some of the proceeds as rebates to makers that ensure liquidity for the platform. The system’s structure appears to be targeting the strategy likely employed by the highly-successful trading bot as the new ‘tax’ will be highest at 50% odds, and will be growing substantially smaller toward the extremes of 0% and 100% probabilities. With that being said, the fees themselves will be rather low even at their highest values as they will never exceed 1.56%. According to Polymarket, the change is aimed at ensuring the fast-moving markets remain ‘deeper, tighter, and easier to trade.’ Featured image via Shutterstock The post Polymarket trading bot that turned $300 into $400,000 — Is now up this much appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news|cryptocurrency|Polymarket|price|trading bots,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The analyst believes that Bitcoin’s overall market structure remains bearish. As a result, he expects the price to fall to about $76,000, representing a 20% decline from current levels. Bitcoin Price At Risk Of 20% Crash Crypto market analyst Roman has issued a warning that Bitcoin could be heading for another sharp decline, with his primary target set near $76,000. In his post on X, he emphasized that the current market structure shows no evidence of a sustainable price bottom and that downside risk remains dominant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Crash Another 50% As Analyst Marks $40,000 Bottom Target Roman explained that his bearish outlook is based on the daily timeframe, where Bitcoin has struggled to regain strong bullish momentum after a significant correction. He also noted that the price is still trading within a broader bearish trend, suggesting the market may simply be taking a pause before the next move lower. The accompanying chart shows BTC trading above $90,000 while still well below the previous resistance area near $96,000. Each attempt to push higher has been rejected, suggesting sellers remain firmly in control of the market. Notably, Roman’s chart has revealed that the expected move lower could start with a drop back to the mid $80,000s, followed by a deeper slide between $78,500 and $75,000. The hand-drawn projection on the chart also illustrates a sharp fall after a brief relief rally, suggesting that BTC’s decline could speed up once support breaks. Volume behavior also plays a key role in Roman’s bearish outlook. The chart shows noticeably weak trading volume during Bitcoin’s recent rebound, which the analyst previously said is typical of holiday-driven pumps. Additional Signals That Support Analyst’s Bearish Forecast Roman’s $76,000 Bitcoin crash forecast is a follow-up to previous posts in which he explained several reasons why the leading cryptocurrency is in a bear market and could correct again soon. He referenced historical indicator behavior to justify his latest prediction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $25,000: Why The Bottom Is Much Lower The analyst explained that Bitcoin’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) were extremely oversold after its price dropped roughly 40% from its all-time high. As a result, the current consolidation has given these indicators a chance to reset. Roman sees the lack of strong buying pressure during this reset as a warning sign. He stressed that a true bullish reversal would need rising volume and clear higher highs, which are not showing on the daily chart. The analyst also noted that Bitcoin’s longer-term trend remains bearish, with the market continuing to form lower highs within a declining range. He has concluded that until clear reversal signals appear, traders should treat any upside moves as corrective, not the start of a fresh bull run.

The upper house of Poland’s bicameral legislature passed the bill it had received from the Sejm, rejecting a number of amendments and adding its own. Senators send vetoed crypto act back to Polish deputies Poland’s long-overdue Crypto-Asset Market Act is returning to the Sejm, the lower house of parliament in Warsaw, after the Senate introduced its corrections before approving it. Most notably, the senators abolished an amendment adopted by the deputies in December, which would have lowered a “supervisory fee” for token issuers from 0.4% to 0.1%. According to the upper chamber’s version of the legislation, the levy will eventually rise to 0.5%, Bitcoin.pl reported on Thursday. The draft law now suggests that the fee is part of the financial obligations of companies issuing digital assets and cannot go below €500, the crypto news outlet detailed and commented: “Yes, although it sounds ridiculous, the senators decided to spoil the bill even further, which has been bad from the start.” Over the past months, the publication has been voicing the local crypto community’s worries that the Polish legislation is far stricter than the latest EU standards it’s supposed to implement. Representatives of the industry have been warning that the charges and requirements it’s introducing are threatening the very survival of domestic crypto firms, especially smaller ones. Overregulation has been a major concern in regard to the framework proposed by the government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition (KO) party. The sponsors of the act are granting Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority ( KNF ) virtually full control over the Polish crypto market, arguably Eastern Europe’s largest. The agency will be able to suspend business activities, block online platforms, including exchanges, and impose heavy financial penalties on service providers at will. The changes made by the Senate are not affecting its powers. At the same time, its majority rejected some 15 amendments proposed by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, the main opposition force. Will Poland regulate its crypto space soon? The ruling coalition’s bill is now returning to the Sejm, which will have the option to accept the Senate’s proposal or restore its earlier variant. In either case, the document will then be resubmitted to President Karol Nawrocki for signature. He is widely expected to reject it once again. The Sejm first passed the controversial law in September. Elected last year with political support from the opposition, the Polish head of state vetoed it in early December. The house approved the returned legislation on second reading later last month, as reported by Cryptopolitan, after its initial attempt to reverse the president’s move failed. In his motives for the veto, Nawrocki added a list of his own concerns about the bill, including regarding the personal and economic freedoms of Poles and the stability of their country. The government responded by accusing him of involvement in a “crypto affair” and of having a “weird relationship” with the sector. According to the Polish prime minister, the latter has been infiltrated by Russian players. Donald Tusk also insisted that the adoption of the proposed bill is a matter of national security. The stalemate surrounding Poland’s crypto act, designed to transpose Europe’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules into national law, is likely to continue. The pro-EU Tusk cabinet does not have the necessary majority to overcome Karol Nawrocki’s veto, while the PiS party won’t be able to secure enough votes for an alternative regulatory framework it’s preparing to present.

Extended consolidation phases quietly absorb supply, test conviction, and build pressure beneath the surface. When those structures finally resolve, price action tends to accelerate rapidly, catching emotionally unprepared participants off guard. That long-term dynamic sits at the center of a recent technical outlook shared by analyst JD on X. JD draws attention to a rare structural setup forming on the XRP/BTC chart, emphasizing that relative strength against Bitcoin often signals major shifts before they appear on dollar-based pairs. His analysis focuses on a multi-year trend rather than short-term volatility. Why the XRP/BTC Pair Is Critical Traders use the XRP/BTC pair to assess whether XRP is gaining strength relative to the broader crypto market . While USD charts reflect external capital flows, the BTC pair reveals internal market rotation. Historically, XRP’s most powerful expansions began only after it established sustained strength against Bitcoin. $XRP – If XRP/BTC can breakout above the 9-YEAR trendline (so close!) I expect BIBLICAL RISE to Price Discovery levels! Dumb Money will get EMOTIONALLY EXICTED, right before the HISTORICAL RUG PULL CRASH! Mark my words.. MAJORITY WILL BE EXIT LIQUIDITY RT for updates!… pic.twitter.com/L6LIezWYXt — JD (@jaydee_757) January 9, 2026 JD highlights a descending trendline that has capped XRP/BTC for nearly nine years. Price has repeatedly rejected this level across multiple market cycles, confirming its technical significance. A clean breakout above such a long-standing structure would suggest a decisive change in market behavior rather than a temporary rally. Entering a Price Discovery Phase Price discovery begins when an asset breaks free from historical resistance and enters territory without established ceilings. JD argues that a confirmed XRP/BTC breakout would place XRP into this phase relative to Bitcoin. In past crypto cycles, similar breakouts triggered rapid repricing as traders adjusted expectations and repositioned capital. When relative strength shifts in favor of an altcoin, liquidity often rotates quickly. Momentum traders, longer-term investors, and algorithmic strategies tend to follow the trend, increasing volatility and compressing price movement into shorter timeframes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Psychology and the Danger of Euphoria JD also emphasized the psychological risks that accompany aggressive rallies. As price accelerates, emotional participation typically increases. Retail traders often enter during late-stage momentum, driven by excitement rather than structure or risk management. History shows that such euphoric conditions frequently precede sharp corrections. These reversals do not invalidate the broader trend, but they often transfer value from late entrants to disciplined participants who planned exits in advance. A Rare Technical Inflection Point The weight of JD’s analysis lies in its duration. Breakouts from structures that span nearly a decade carry exceptional implications . They often mark transitions between market regimes rather than ordinary trend continuations. Whether the breakout confirms or fails, XRP now sits at a pivotal technical juncture. For investors and traders alike, the setup reinforces a timeless lesson. The market rewards patience, preparation, and emotional control far more consistently than excitement alone.
