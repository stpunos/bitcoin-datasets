Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI (14) is 43.25, still below 50, while MACD is still below zero, showing momentum is improving slowly, but buyers are not strong yet. Support is around $0.2042 and $0.200. Resistance is around $0.2056, then $0.206–$0.207, then $0.215 and $0.22. As of January 2, 2026, Pi Network is trading sideways today, with price holding in a tight range just above the $0.20 level as buyers and sellers stay evenly matched. Pi is holding near $0.205, with a market cap around $1.71B and 24-hour volume near $7.96M, which is still light and shows limited conviction. The market looks calm, with Pi stabilizing rather than starting a clear upward move. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows small-bodied candles, showing consolidation rather than a strong move in either direction. Price is basically just above the mid-$0.2052 area with no clear follow-through from buyers or sellers. The RSI (14) is 43.25, with its signal line near 40.96, which keeps momentum below the neutral 50 mark and suggests buyers are still cautious. Selling pressure isn’t aggressive, but RSI needs to push back toward the high-40s/50 area to show stronger demand. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the histogram is +0.0010, while the MACD line is −0.0042 and the signal line is −0.0052. Both lines being below zero means the broader trend is still bearish, but the positive histogram shows the downside pressure is easing and the market is trying to stabilize. Support is around $0.204 and then $0.200, while resistance is near $0.206 and $0.210. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading around $0.2051 and is slightly higher on the session, with the latest candle showing O $0.2049, H $0.2053, L $0.2048, C $0.2051. Price action is still tight, but it’s slowly grinding upward from the late-December dip, with candles holding above the mid-$0.20 area instead of slipping back under it. The RSI (14) is 59.42, with its signal line near 53.00, which keeps momentum above 50 and shows buyers have more control than earlier in the week. It’s not an aggressive rally, but it does suggest the market is leaning slightly positive on this timeframe. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the values are MACD 0.0002, signal 0.0000, and histogram 0.0002. Because these readings are at or just above the zero line, it means bearish pressure has faded, and momentum is mildly positive, but the numbers are small, so the move is still weak and could stay range-bound. Support is around $0.204 and $0.202, while resistance is near $0.206 and $0.208. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2707 SELL SMA 5 $0.2354 SELL SMA 10 $0.2207 SELL SMA 21 $0.2157 SELL SMA 50 $0.2278 SELL SMA 100 $0.2377 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2112 SELL EMA 5 $0.2185 SELL EMA 10 $0.2396 SELL EMA 21 $0.2782 SELL EMA 50 $0.3429 SELL EMA 100 $0.4387 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? If Pi keeps holding the $0.20 support, the most likely move is more sideways trading with small bounces toward the $0.206–$0.21 resistance area. If it drops and closes clearly below $0.20, the downside risk increases, and the price could slide toward the next lower zone before buyers step back in. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is slightly up because supply pressure is easing: today’s large unlock is among the last big daily releases before unlocks drop, and some PI has moved off exchanges, reducing immediate sell pressure in a thin market. On the chart, a mild technical rebound (MACD turning up and RSI still not overbought) is helping, but unclear roadmap sentiment is still limiting a stronger move. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value. Recent Pi News/Opinions Pi Network’s Core Team published a 2025 recap highlighting milestones such as February’s Open Network launch, AI integrations, and ongoing KYC progress. As 2025 comes to a close, Pi remains focused on steady progress, responsible building, and long-term utility creation.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $90,689, it will fuel a bullish rally to $94,661. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $86,356, beginning a bearish trend to $83,468. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying pressure as sellers failed to push the price below immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2028, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November. Bitcoin ended December 2025 on a bearish note by trading below $90K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Echoing the views of several other prominent voices in finance – notably of Robert Kiyosaki – McGlone opined on January 1 that 2026 will be a year of volatility and crisis but also one of opportunity for the ‘tactically orientated’ to make a fortune. Base Case Update 2026 – Dope-Sniffing Dogs May Prevail: – Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000 – President Trump faces similarly poor timing as Herbert Hoover – A third down year for US stocks since 2008 – Cryptos to lead the next… — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) January 1, 2026 Will the Great Depression 2.0 start in 2026? Though measured in tone, the Commodity Strategist hinted he expects 2026 to be a crisis year by providing a historical parallel. Specifically, he opined that President Donald Trump shall suffer from poor timing, much like President Herbert Hoover. Hoover famously entered the Oval Office in 1929, mere months before the Great Depression started. McGlone provided both evidence for his assumptions and issued several stark predictions. Specifically, he identified gold’s grabbing of alpha – its ability to outperform the market – as a major warning sign evident through much of 2025. Gold grabbing alpha in 2025 was a warning – especially vs. falling crude oil Unfortunately for investors hoping to benefit from the precious metals boom, the market expert also opined that gold, silver , and most similar assets will suffer from, in his words, ‘went up-too-much’ dangers in 2026. Similarly, McGlone identified T-Bonds – the debt securities of the American government – as the stars of the market, as he estimates they will be the ones to ‘take alpha’ from the yellow metal in the ongoing year. Will the crypto market bloom in 2026? Mike McGlone simultaneously gave a word of warning to cryptocurrency investors as he forecasted that a Bitcoin ( BTC ) fall to $50,000 is more likely than a rally back to $100,000. As evidence, he cited that Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the digital assets market – dropped 19% last year. Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000. Cryptos to lead the next post-inflation deflation cycle due to wealth creation reversion. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index dropped 19% in 2025. External evidence that the cryptocurrency bull market can be found in the fact that the 4-year BTC cycle pattern has been broken. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to enjoy three green years followed by a major correction. BTC 12-month price chart.

However, while the pressure is clearly visible, artificial intelligence ( AI ) models suggest that the cryptocurrency may somewhat stabilize this month and maybe see some gains. Some early signs of this stabilization may already be evident, with Bitcoin trading at around $89,500 at the time of writing, up nearly 2% on the day due to a supportive technical picture. Bitcoin price reclaims key technical levels A few of the core momentum measures have also strengthened, led by the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 70.4, signaling firm upside momentum. The MACD value of 319.5 likewise remains positive. Trend strength readings further reinforced the picture. For instance, the Average Directional Index ( ADX ) rose to 65.2, a level typically associated with bullish directional moves. Similarly, a positive Rate of Change ( ROC ) at 1.308 indicates that bulls are firmly in control of order flow. However, it must be noted that the white/red Stochastic Oscillator, which measures price momentum over the past nine periods smoothed across six periods, is at 99.2, suggesting a consolidation period or a pullback toward short-term moving averages is possible. AI Bitcoin price prediction for January 2026 With the technical picture hinting at potential short-term upticks, Finbold used its AI-driven price prediction tool to see where BTC could sit by the end of the month. To generate its forecast, the model aggregates results from ChatGPT , Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4, pointing to a range of potential outcomes. Finbold AI BTC price forecast. Source: Finbold The average Bitcoin price target for the end of January came out at $91,900, implying a 2.67% upside from current levels. Claude Sonnet 4 gave the most bullish figure, projecting a potential 6.97% rally, while Gemini 2.5 Flash actually suggested the price could go down 0.07% downside. ChatGPT was bullish but conservative, arguing for a 1.1% gain. Finbold AI BTC technical analysis. Source: Finbold Overall, Bitcoin’s potential this month primarily reflects its technical resilience, although it can be added that $12 million in altcoin-driven liquidity inflows could also have played a role. In other words, short-term momentum currently favors buyers, who are closely watching whether Bitcoin can defend support around $88,319, the 61.8% Fibonacci level .

According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, a bearish market sentiment has taken hold over the past few months, with some market watchers claiming the top of the four-year market cycle has already passed. The crypto market analytics platform believes investor sentiment has changed due to Bitcoin’s muted end-of-year performance, but the lines between traditional financial assets and crypto are also blurred, as companies experiment with new forms of tokenization. Delphi market analysis: Equity is moving onchain Per Delphi’s 2026 outlook , the distinction between tokens and traditional equity is now more difficult to define since companies like California-based Securitize are filing for initial public offerings (IPOs) while simultaneously looking into tokenization. Crypto is facing a token identity crisis. The lines are blurring on both sides. Equity is moving onchain with companies like Securitize filing for IPOs. Tokens are becoming more equity like through MetaDAO's ownership coins and Uniswap's fee switch. Customer Acquisition Cost… pic.twitter.com/CgjHQuHq8q — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) January 1, 2026 Some crypto projects, such as MetaDAO have launched ownership tokens that mimic how traditional financial firms issue shares, and decentralized platform Uniswap has added fee switches, much like how equity-like returns are for token holders. Among the upcoming token models is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tokens, which are distinct to equity-like tokens or governance mechanisms because they fund user acquisition at scale. PayPal is one of the many companies moving forward with tokenization, having spent over $60 million in venture capital cash on incentives to begin its quest for digital assets. Yet, per Delphi, CAC tokens could achieve comparable results through token emissions, where early adopters can receive larger rewards that taper as the network grows. The analysts cited Worldcoin as the best example of this model, reportedly spreading over 500 million WLD tokens to onboard users and expanding the footprint of its World App. According to data from Dune analytics, the project crossed $3.8 billion market cap level during the bull market run in mid-2025, although its token’s price traded below $2.5 in the whole of last year. US regulatory clarity opens crypto market to institutions Changes in regulations have made things much clearer for the crypto industry, especially in the US and Europe. POTUS signed an executive order in the US to encourage responsible innovation and the use of stablecoins backed by the dollar. However, he also clearly said that a CBDC was not an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went a step ahead to support experimentation by issuing no-action letters for the Depository Trust Company’s tokenization pilot and the Fuse Crypto Token. US Congress is in support of crypto-friendly candidates for 2026 midterms. This comes against the backdrop of discussing the CLARITY Act , which places crypto regulatory oversight in the hands of the CFTC. Although some economists believe there are still some hiccups in country-by-country jurisdictional rules, MiCA has been protecting investors and has made the environment more palatable for institutions to join in. Crypto market mulls optimism as Bitcoin trades just below $90,000 Despite the ongoing gloomy outlook, there is a perception that the industry has grown enough to handle downturns and escape historic crypto winters. “It’s more of an industry now. So if there is a winter or a downturn, it’s not going to be a complete lights-out moment,” Kaiko senior researcher Adam Morgan McCarthy told NPR. The crypto derivatives market has approximately $2.2 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options reaching expiration, with the former taking up $1.87 billion in notional value currently outstanding. At the time of this reporting, the king coin is trading at around $88,970, just above the $88,000 “max pain” point, where option writers may start counting heavy losses. Coinglass open interest data shows 14,194 call contracts have been placed against 6,806 puts, which could mean hodlers are bracing for a price comeback upwards of $90,000.

Price action is compressing, RSI is turning higher, and institutional buyers continue to accumulate, yet prediction markets remain skeptical of a rapid six-figure breakout. Polymarket odds still favor $120,000 as the most likely outcome, even as Bitcoin trades within a tightening triangle near $89,000. The next move could set the tone for the year ahead. Polymarket: Why Traders Are Hesitant to Predict a Quick $150K Bitcoin Price Surge Bitcoin is kickstarting 2026 with a mixed bag of optimism and realism. While analysts are still tossing around six-figure targets, Polymarket traders are still being cautious about how high they think BTC can go before 2027. Looking at the market odds, you see that the most likely outcome is $120,000, with a 45% probability, even though that level is below its 2025 all-time high. But the confidence in higher targets is starting to wane. Polymarket is saying: 35% of traders think $130,000 is a possibility 28% of traders think $140,000 is a possibility 21% of traders think $150,000 is a possibility Source: Polymarket By contrast, the market is saying there’s probably an 80% chance Bitcoin either holds or recovers the $100,000 zone, suggesting traders think it will hold firm but don’t expect a rags-to-riches surge right away. This caution might be due to cycle dynamics – Bitcoin ended last year in the red, and with the 4-year halving cycle coming to a close, traders are probably being a bit more picky about where they put their bets. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Signals Long-Term Commitment On the other hand, despite softer sentiment among individual traders, the institutions are still putting their money where their mouth is. In the last quarter of 2025, Japan-based Metaplanet added 4,279 BTC, bringing its stash to 35,102 BTC, which is worth a cool $3.1 billion at today’s prices. Even though their stock price has been a bit of a dud, they’re still treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Tether has done the same thing. As BTC dipped below $88,000, the stablecoin issuer added 8,889 BTC, which cost them about $778.7 million. These purchases don’t guarantee a quick price spike, but they do show that the big players are using the dips to get a bit more exposure. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Triangle Breakout Or Triangle Breakdown? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction continues to be neutral, as BTC is trading around $89,400, stuck inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. This pattern is more about tightening volatility than any weakness. The price is still forming higher lows, and the resistance line is sloping down from $92,800 to $93,000. BTC is oscillating around a pivot zone near $88,200-$89,000, where the 50-day and 100-day EMA100-day EMAs are converging. This compression of the EMAs is a sign of balance, not a sign that things are approaching a breaking point. As long as the price stays above the rising trendline from $84,400 and the 200-day EMA near $87,000, the overall structure remains constructive. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The candlestick action is backing that up as well. Recent sessions are showing spinning tops and small-bodied candles, which are more a sign of indecision than of selling off. The RSI has broken its short-term downtrend and is now above 55, suggesting momentum is strengthening. If Bitcoin can close above $90,500, that would resolve the triangle to the upside and open a path towards $92,800 and then $95,000. If it breaks below $87,000, though, that would be a blow to the setup and open the possibility of a move down to $85,800; at the moment, the structure is more likely to be on the upside. What Could Trigger Bitcoin’s Next Major Move in 2026 With institutions soaking up supply and price compressing to a technical apex, the setup suggests preparation is underway, not exhaustion. Whether the next move is a measured breakout or just another range expansion will define how quickly those $150,000 targets start looking realistic. For now, traders are betting on patience, and history suggests Bitcoin tends to reward it. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

While there has been no significant bullish breakout yet, the price is pressing against key local resistances. Buyers are trying to reclaim control, but the lack of follow-through makes this a pivotal area to watch. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC remains trapped within a descending channel, testing the upper boundary once again near the critical $90K level. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages located above $95K act as major dynamic resistance levels, and buyers have yet to reclaim them. Despite recent bounce attempts, momentum has been fading. RSI is climbing but is still around the neutral territory, indicating that there is room for a move higher. If buyers fail to break above the $90K zone and the higher boundary of the channel, another visit to the $80K support zone remains likely. Until that breakout happens, this is still a bearish market structure. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the asset has been consolidating in a short-term channel. Multiple rejections from the $90K level, located at the middle of the channel, have formed a mid-range ceiling. Meanwhile, higher lows forming gradually below this zone show that buyers are slowly stepping in. The RSI is also pushing higher, showing bullish momentum building while still not being overbought. If a clean breakout above $90K occurs with strength, it opens up the way for a move toward the primary resistance zone at $95K. On the other hand, failure at the $90K zone could mean another sweep back toward $86K and even a breakdown of the channel that could pave the way for a deeper drop toward the $80K area. On-Chain Analysis The BTC exchange reserve metric continues to drop sharply, hitting 2.75M BTC, a significant multi-year low. This trend reflects ongoing accumulation and reduced sell pressure on centralized exchanges. While the price action has remained stagnant, this underlying metric supports the long-term bullish thesis. However, the disconnect between low reserves and weak price action highlights the broader uncertainty and hesitation among market participants heading into the first quarter of 2026. Therefore, more sideways or even corrections might be required before the market can begin rallying again.

As per the current market, “What price will Bitcoin hit before 2027?” Polymarket shows 45% odds of Bitcoin reaching $120,000. Notably, this price point is below its all-time high. The probabilities drop sharply at higher price levels, with $130,000 carrying a 35% chance, $140,000 falling to 28%, and $150,000 priced at just 21%. Reports indicate that traders are placing a safe bet, with an 80% likelihood that BTC will reach a peak of $100,000 . With this move in place, sources claimed that it was unclear why users opt to be very cautious. Some assumed that they decided to adopt this approach in relation to the end of the four-year cycle , following Bitcoin’s major losses in 2025. Uncertainties surrounding the fate of Bitcoin spark controversy Regarding the four-year cycle, it is worth noting that the cycle followed trends around halving events in the history of BTC. It also played a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by helping traders forecast future movements. Now that the cycle is losing prominence, analysts suggest that a new trading pattern may be emerging. Interestingly, despite the crypto market being pessimistic, experts still propose that 2026 will be a strong year for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump made it clear that he intends to announce the US Federal Reserve’s new chair in the upcoming weeks. This news sparked hope in the cryptocurrency industry, as many had anticipated that interest rates would decrease. Immediately after those assumptions, the prices of precious metals, such as gold and silver, increased significantly, with both reaching new peaks in the last quarter of 2025. Digital assets, on the other hand, remained unchanged. Analysts are now expressing the likelihood of crucial crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, to provide straightforward regulations and potentially facilitate significant institutional adoption. Several analysts from firms such as Standard Chartered, Strategy, and Bernstein forecast that the price of BTC may reach an all-time high of $150,000 by 2026. Others, like Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who adopted a more positive outlook on the matter, suggested that the cryptocurrency could rise as much as $200,000 to $250,000. Traders point out some of the limitations surrounding BTC’s growth Bitcoin’s price ignited tension in the crypto industry after dropping sharply in November. Analysts claim that some factors could not sustain the cryptocurrency’s price above the $110,000 level. These factors were institutional investments and corporate purchases. They provided various reasons to back this claim. Among these reasons, one key factor raised is the surging interest in Bitcoin options, particularly those related to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. In the meantime, it was confirmed that the total open interest in Bitcoin options escalated from a record of $39 billion noted in December 2024 to a new level in December 2025. Analysts explained that this rise led to heightened awareness of the covered call strategy in the ecosystem. Critics, on the other hand, expressed their belief that by leasing out their anticipated earnings for a fee, major investors have unintentionally set a restriction that halts Bitcoin from attaining its next substantial growth phase. To better understand this point, analysts noted that it is useful to perceive a covered call as an option between earning a higher price and receiving a regular income. Don’t just read crypto news.

This development follows the year-end holiday period when traditional markets closed while cryptocurrency spot trading continued globally. Market analysts now scrutinize this price discrepancy as a potential catalyst for increased volatility during early 2026 trading sessions. Understanding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap represents a measurable price difference between the December 31, 2025 closing price and the January 2, 2026 opening price. Importantly, this gap formed because Bitcoin’s spot market continued trading during the CME’s holiday closure from December 31 through January 1. Consequently, when futures trading resumed, the contract prices adjusted to reflect spot market movements that occurred during the exchange’s inactivity. Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized market analyst, first identified this development through social media platform X. The analyst noted that such gaps typically become focal points for short-term trading strategies. Furthermore, historical data shows that approximately 85% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies significantly based on market conditions. The Mechanics of Futures Market Dislocations CME Bitcoin futures operate on a regulated schedule that differs from cryptocurrency spot markets. While spot exchanges like Coinbase and Binance operate 24/7 throughout the year, traditional derivatives markets observe specific holidays and weekends. This structural difference creates periodic disconnections between derivative and spot prices. Recent Notable CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps Date Gap Size Fill Time Market Context January 2024 $420 3 days Post-ETF approval rally July 2024 $580 14 days Regulatory uncertainty period January 2025 $510 7 days Institutional adoption phase January 2026 $655 TBD Current analysis period Market Implications and Historical Precedents The current $655 gap represents one of the larger January openings in CME Bitcoin futures history. Market participants generally monitor these gaps because they often create technical trading opportunities. Specifically, traders might position themselves to profit from the expected price movement toward the gap fill level. However, the timing remains uncertain and depends on multiple market factors. Historical analysis reveals several important patterns: January gaps tend to fill faster than mid-year gaps, averaging 5.3 days versus 11.7 days Larger gaps (over $500) typically indicate stronger market momentum during the closure period Institutional participation in gap fills has increased steadily since 2023 Volatility spikes often accompany the gap-filling process, particularly during Asian trading hours Expert Perspectives on the 2026 Market Opening Financial analysts emphasize that CME gaps provide valuable information about market sentiment during exchange closures. The $655 discrepancy suggests significant spot market activity occurred while institutional traders couldn’t adjust their futures positions. This situation potentially indicates several market dynamics, including retail-driven movements, geopolitical developments, or algorithmic trading patterns that continued during the holiday period. According to derivatives market specialists, CME Bitcoin futures now represent approximately 35% of all regulated Bitcoin derivatives volume globally. This substantial market share means gaps in CME contracts often influence broader market psychology, even affecting spot prices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The current gap’s size suggests particularly strong momentum developed during the two-day trading hiatus. Technical Analysis and Trading Considerations Traders typically approach CME gaps using specific technical methodologies. The gap area itself often functions as both support and resistance, depending on the gap’s direction. For the current $655 gap, analysts will monitor whether prices move toward filling the gap quickly or if the market establishes new trading ranges above or below the gap zone. Several factors could influence how this situation develops: Volume analysis during the first week of January trading Institutional flows through regulated investment products Global macroeconomic developments affecting risk assets Cryptocurrency-specific news regarding regulation or adoption Market technicians note that gap fills don’t always occur immediately. Sometimes markets establish new trends that leave gaps unfilled for extended periods. However, statistical analysis shows that CME Bitcoin futures gaps under $700 have a 92% fill rate within 30 trading days, based on data from 2020 through 2025. The Regulatory and Institutional Context The CME’s position as a regulated exchange adds significance to these market events. Unlike cryptocurrency-native derivatives platforms, CME operates under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight with traditional market hours and holiday schedules. This regulatory framework attracts institutional participants who may interpret gaps differently than cryptocurrency-native traders. Since the 2023 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the relationship between CME futures and spot markets has strengthened considerably. Many institutional trading desks now use CME futures for hedging ETF exposures, creating additional connections between these market segments. The January 2026 gap therefore reflects not just holiday trading patterns but also evolving institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Global Market Reactions and Comparative Analysis While the CME observed its holiday schedule, other global derivatives markets showed varied responses. European exchanges with different holiday calendars displayed smaller gaps, while Asian markets demonstrated continuous trading throughout the period. This geographic variation in market structure creates arbitrage opportunities that sophisticated traders often exploit during such dislocations. The $655 gap size exceeds most comparable periods in recent years. For context, the average January CME Bitcoin futures gap from 2021-2025 measured $387, making the current development approximately 69% larger than the recent average. This substantial difference suggests unusual market conditions developed during the year-end transition period. Risk Management Perspectives Professional traders emphasize that gap trading carries specific risks. While historical patterns provide guidance, each market situation involves unique variables. Risk managers typically recommend position sizing that accounts for the possibility that gaps may not fill as expected or may take longer than anticipated to resolve. Additionally, the increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and traditional markets adds complexity to gap analysis. During the 2025 holiday period, traditional equity and bond markets also experienced unusual movements that might have influenced cryptocurrency sentiment indirectly through portfolio rebalancing or risk appetite adjustments. Conclusion The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap forming on the first trading day of 2026 represents a significant market development with implications for short-term volatility and trading strategies. This event highlights the ongoing structural differences between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency trading ecosystems. As institutional participation in cryptocurrency derivatives grows, understanding these market mechanics becomes increasingly important for all market participants. The coming weeks will reveal whether this gap fills quickly or establishes new trading parameters for early 2026. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a CME Bitcoin futures gap? A CME Bitcoin futures gap occurs when there’s a price difference between the closing price before a market holiday and the opening price after the holiday. This happens because Bitcoin’s spot market trades continuously while CME futures have specific trading hours and holidays. Q2: How often do these gaps typically get filled? Historical data from 2020-2025 shows approximately 85-92% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies from immediate to several weeks depending on market conditions and gap size. Q3: Why does the CME have different trading hours than spot cryptocurrency exchanges? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange operates as a traditional regulated financial exchange with set hours and holidays, while cryptocurrency spot markets operate 24/7 globally without traditional market closures. Q4: How does this $655 gap compare to previous years? The $655 gap exceeds the average January gap of $387 from 2021-2025 by approximately 69%, making it one of the larger January openings in recent CME Bitcoin futures history. Q5: What should traders watch regarding this development? Traders typically monitor trading volume, institutional flows, and whether prices begin moving toward the gap level. The speed and manner of any potential gap fill can provide insights into market sentiment and momentum for early 2026.

Index fund flows and passive investing have fundamentally altered market dynamics, making stock-picking more challenging and indexation effects unavoidable. Portfolio allocation size matters more than simple buy/hold/sell labels; conviction and volatility should drive position sizing. Sector movements are increasingly dictated by ETF flows, causing good companies to underperform as index dominance overshadows fundamentals. “Mediocre.” I guess there are many worse things we can be called. I've been called plenty of those in the comments section here, as I approach 2,500 of those answered in 3 years. Quite a journey so far. Thanks to all who have taken the time to read my work during 2025. Mediocre is also how I describe how Bitcoin has performed historically. Does that sound strange, given its monster move earlier this year to an all-time high? Or, due to its even bigger run-up since before most of us knew what cryptocurrency was (or when “staking” was a misspelled way to say, “I'm making steak for dinner”)? Here's what I'm getting at. This is Bitcoin's price since mid-November of 2021. So more than 4 years ago. That's when it touched $60,000. Since that time, it has doubled, and then some, topping out at $126,000 on October 6 of 2025. And now, around $88,000 near year-end 2025, off 30% from that peak, it is up only 34% from where it was more than 49 months ago. So about an 8% annualized return. Data by YCharts The bad news: that's a lot more risk to take on when, as we see below, T-bills earned half that return, despite starting near a 0% rate in late 2021. And the much-maligned non-US segment of the stock market, represented above by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF ( EFA ), had a nice year in 2025, but that followed 3 years of zilch. Yet based only on the strength of a solid past 12 months, EFA's return since that November 2021 starting point now exceeds that of Bitcoin. As we see above, EFA (orange line) and Bitcoin (purple line) took very different directions but ended up at about the same spot. What does this say about Bitcoin's future as an investment? NOTHING. What does it say about perception versus reality when it comes to popular asset types? A LOT. This is why I recently published this table as part of a detailed article on how I'm using 10 ETFs as the current “core” of my Allocation portfolio that I run for investing group members and also share with subscribers at my website. The goal is to coach investors based on my experience allocating through modern market conditions, with risk management at the forefront of everything. ETF Yourself Using Bitcoin to lower risk? You might be surprised to hear “Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT )” and “risk management at the forefront” in the same place. That's the whole idea. To combine asset classes that often exhibit LOW CORRELATION to each other, particularly when markets tank. Look, I get it. Crypto-millionaires and even billionaires are out there. I live close enough to Miami, where many of them now reside, to realize that. But with all investments, there are the early adopters. And while some hit it big, time after time, for many it is more like a strategic “lottery ticket.” The way venture capitalists reportedly fail 90% of the time . But if that one out of 10 takes off, the other 9 are quickly forgotten. Among my other pursuits, I own a partial interest in some racehorses. It's the steadiest part of the game (“claiming”), but it is still a sport in which one win pays for a string of 5th- and 6th-place finishes. The focus here is on the iShares Bitcoin ETF, the largest of its kind. And its relationship to the S&P 500, past and potentially in the future. Because recently, the biggest, most exciting trades of the last few years have started to roll over. But as I recall as a past dog owner, they can flip themselves right back up in a nanosecond. So that's always a possibility. When markets are driven as they are now by algorithms and index fund flows, and nearly every market segment picks a side (are you a risk-on asset or a risk-off asset?), this is something we'll all need to live with as investors. Market indecision is much more common these days. And it leads me to the key factor of position-sizing. Position-sizing: a quick introduction My entire investing process is about this: “Buy/Hold/Sell” are very misleading ways to characterize any investment at any point in time. It says everything about WHAT you are owning or not, but not a thing about HOW MUCH AS A PERCENT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO you are allocating to it. If I have a buy rating on 2 stocks, 1 might be 1% of my portfolio (more volatile, less committed to it, just dipping my toe in for starters). And the other is 5% of my portfolio. That might be because it is much less volatile, and I need to own more to get the dollar return I seek. Or, I might just believe it is an ideal situation (chart-wise, which is my main approach). Now to that IBIT situation and why I have it as a semi-regular spot among 10 ETFs in that allocation portfolio. I've smoothed this out to 3-month rolling returns, with 1-month moving windows. And while IBIT is just reaching 2 years old, the thing with Bitcoin is this: it acts differently with so much ETF money having plowed in. The same can be said for the S&P 500. Data by YCharts Yet in that picture above, I see a pair of ETFs that sometimes rise and fall together but are different in terms of volatility and the potential to move independently of each other. I can't say that about a lot of equity ETFs compared to SPY and about a lot of crypto ETFs compared to IBIT. So for now, they exhibit enough for me to allocate to each, just in varying allocations. Based on their relative attractiveness. These are the basics of diversification. But it is SO MUCH TOUGHER to find nowadays. Thanks to the forces that now move markets. And the jury is still out on Bitcoin's true place in the long-term fabric of the investor's total picture. If you were there more than 10 years ago, congratulations, you are up 15,000%. If you jumped on board 4 years ago, you underperformed much of the stock market. Data by YCharts And if you were one of many who piled in at the start of 2024, when IBIT and 11 other spot Bitcoin ETFs made it easier to own crypto, you are up 87%, comfortably ahead of SPY over that same time. Now, with reference to this chart below, just 3 months ago IBIT led SPY by 168% to 44%. So that margin went from 124% to under 40% in a hurry. Data by YCharts But that again is my point. Stock picking or allocating across many types of stocks via ETFs is not nearly as productive or efficient as it once was. And the IBIT/SPY pair is part of a mountain of evidence supporting that, which grows every day. But since IBIT is still being treated as the nascent asset it is, this is still a good time to consider it. So it made it into my 10-ETF mix, something I frankly was not expecting. That is, until I whittled 4,400 ETFs down to my forced target of only 10. Now, I allocate tactically AMONG the 10 in that table above. I own at least a little of each at all times, as long as it is in the 10. A “permanent portfolio,” if you will. But where are the individual ETFs that make up the 10? While most will stay on the roster for a long time, some will be swapped out. Not when they look unattractive from a short-term return standpoint. When they are no longer providing a diversification benefit, either long-term or short-term. For now, IBIT makes the cut. I can control risk in it with that 2% minimum weighting and control my own excitement toward it (if that happens) with that 10% maximum weighting. And I remind myself that 5% is a “long-term expected average” position for IBIT within the 10 ETF portfolio, though 2% to 10% is the range I'm allowing myself to trade it within. To me, THAT is investing today. Not simply what I own, but how much and how often. Do I like SPY or IBIT better? I like both to different degrees at different times. And in the 10-ETF portfolio, I left SPY out entirely in its cap-weighted form, opting instead to use a mix of QQQ-DIA-RSP, as that trio is much more flexible than SPY alone (separate article on that coming soon). IBIT's technical chart does not look robust, and it is still subject to a combination of big risks. Just ask Michael Saylor (head man at Strategy, symbol MSTR). Those risks include a potential top in crypto enthusiasm, due in part to a peak in market liquidity, as well as repatriation of assets toward home currency assets (China and Japan are doing a lot of that currently). Barchart I've documented SPY's risks here many times for many years. And in its top-heavy form, it still hangs in there, for now. IBIT, SPY, and the bigger portfolio-wide impacts So, why do I make room for at least a 2% allocation to IBIT and also to each of QQQ, DIA, and RSP in that 10-ETF model portfolio? Because: I don't think I'm smarter than the market. I want diversification, but smart diversification, not “I think I'm diversified” diversification, which fails when we need it most. I have a mechanism to produce indicators as to how I want to rotate between those 4 ETFs and the 6 others pictured in the table. My method (ROAR) is not the subject of this article, but it will be in others. And it's there not to be pushed on people, but to show how SOMETHING should be your allocation mechanism. Not just “every 3 months I rebalance.” IBIT allows me to take some shots with small amounts of money, by design. In its brief history, it has had an 80% rally in 3 months and lost more than 25% in 3 months. It's 30% off its high as I write this. 3 months' time! So I expect there to be tactical opportunities to spot in the charts and rotate between that 2% and 10% allocation range. Data by YCharts Finally, using SPY as a proxy for the trio of stock ETFs I use in the 10-ETF portfolio, but the only “offensive weapon” I use in my 2-ETF portfolio (alongside BIL, a T-bill ETF), here's the range of possible outcomes based on the past. Since just before the pandemic, it has shown the potential to move more than 20% in either direction over a 3-month period. Data by YCharts That's a good reason to not set it and forget it, even if US equities are the default anchor of the portfolio. But those defense ETFs are the backstop, something I think more investors should consider the case for in their portfolios. This is all about risk management WHILE pursuing return over all time frames. My goal is to keep drawdowns below 5% and sacrifice some upside at times if that's what it takes. But am I limiting my ability to compete with a traditional “balanced” portfolio over time? Not at all, as I'll continue to discuss here in the new year. Because risk management does not mean capping returns. It means keeping enough capital intact at all times to live to fight another day, or year for that matter.",IBIT|BTC-USD|VOO|IVV|SPY|DIA|DJI|IWM|NDX|QQQ|SP500,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56731714,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258003,1767361211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Shift: Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Bold $30 Million Latin America Exit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitfarms-sells-paraguay-facility-exit/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Shift: Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Bold $30 Million Latin America Exit In a significant strategic pivot, Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms has finalized the $30 million sale of its Paraguay facility, marking a complete withdrawal from Latin American operations and redirecting capital toward emerging technology sectors. This move, announced via GlobeNewswire, signals a broader industry trend where cryptocurrency miners are diversifying their business models beyond pure digital asset production. Consequently, the transaction represents a calculated reallocation of resources in response to evolving market dynamics and technological opportunities. Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Major Portfolio Restructuring Bitfarms Ltd. has sold its 70-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility in Paso Pe, Paraguay, to Sympatheia Power Fund. The company disclosed the $30 million deal on May 15, 2025. This sale concludes Bitfarms’ operational presence in Latin America. The facility previously contributed to the company’s global hash rate. However, management has decided to reallocate these assets. Therefore, the proceeds will fund new ventures in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). The Paso Pe site began operations in 2022. It leveraged Paraguay’s abundant hydroelectric power. This renewable energy source offered a cost-effective advantage for energy-intensive mining. Nonetheless, the company’s strategic review identified greater potential elsewhere. Subsequently, executives approved the divestment. This decision aligns with a corporate focus on higher-margin infrastructure projects. Moreover, it optimizes the company’s geographical footprint for future growth. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Mining Industry’s Strategic Pivot The Bitcoin mining sector is undergoing a substantial transformation. Historically, companies competed primarily on hash rate and energy cost. Now, many are exploring adjacent technological fields. For instance, HPC and AI data centers require similar infrastructure. They need robust power supplies, advanced cooling, and secure facilities. Consequently, mining firms possess transferable expertise. This industry shift is driven by several key factors. Post-Halving Economics: The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards. This event pressured mining profitability, compelling operational efficiency. Energy Market Volatility: Global energy price fluctuations impact mining margins significantly, encouraging diversification. AI Infrastructure Demand: Demand for AI compute power is surging, creating a lucrative adjacent market for data center operators. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations in various jurisdictions introduce uncertainty, prompting portfolio adjustments. Capital Allocation: Investors increasingly reward diversified technology plays over single-asset commodity producers. This trend is not isolated to Bitfarms. Several other publicly-traded miners have announced similar strategic reviews. They are evaluating existing assets for alternative uses. Therefore, the Bitfarms Paraguay sale is a notable case study in this broader movement. Expert Perspective on Mining Industry Evolution Industry analysts view this move as a logical adaptation. “Mining companies are natural infrastructure operators,” notes a report from Compass Point Research. “Their core competency is managing large-scale, power-hungry computing operations in often remote locations. This skill set translates directly to the burgeoning HPC and AI data center market.” The report further highlights that the capital-intensive nature of mining necessitates constant evaluation of return on invested capital (ROIC). Financial data supports this strategic rationale. A comparison of key metrics illustrates the potential appeal of diversifying revenue streams. Potential Revenue Stream Comparison: Bitcoin Mining vs. AI/HPC Hosting Metric Traditional Bitcoin Mining AI/HPC Infrastructure Hosting Revenue Model Volatile; tied to Bitcoin price & network difficulty Predictable; often long-term contracted service fees Capital Intensity Very High (ASIC hardware) High (GPU/TPU clusters & cooling) Power Cost Sensitivity Extremely High High, but often passed through in contracts Hardware Lifespan ~3-4 years before obsolescence ~4-5 years, with more upgrade flexibility Regulatory Scrutiny Increasing globally Established and generally stable This comparative analysis shows why diversification is attractive. AI infrastructure offers more stable, contracted revenue. It also faces different regulatory pressures. Therefore, Bitfarms’ pivot aims to build a more resilient business model. The Future Focus: High-Performance Computing and AI Energy Infrastructure Bitfarms plans to reinvest the $30 million from the Paraguay sale. The capital will develop high-performance computing and AI-based energy infrastructure. Company executives have outlined a clear vision. They intend to leverage their existing expertise in large-scale electrical and thermal management. This expertise is critical for modern data centers. Specifically, AI training clusters generate immense heat. Efficient cooling solutions are paramount. Mining firms have years of experience solving this problem. The company’s existing facilities in the United States and Canada are potential candidates for conversion. These sites already have secured power contracts and robust grid connections. Furthermore, they are located in regions with supportive policies for technology investment. Redeveloping a portion of these sites for HPC could happen relatively quickly. This approach allows for a phased transition. It also mitigates risk by maintaining some Bitcoin mining revenue during the build-out. This strategic direction receives support from market forecasts. Demand for AI compute is projected to grow exponentially through the decade. Firms providing the physical infrastructure for this demand are well-positioned. Consequently, Bitfarms is entering a competitive but high-growth market. Their differentiator will be proven experience in managing megawatt-scale computing operations reliably and efficiently. Conclusion The sale of the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility represents a strategic inflection point for the company and reflects a wider evolution within the cryptocurrency mining industry. By exiting Latin America and reallocating $30 million toward high-performance computing and AI infrastructure, Bitfarms is proactively adapting to post-halving economics and capitalizing on the explosive demand for artificial intelligence compute capacity. This pivot highlights the increasing convergence between digital asset infrastructure and the broader technology sector, as firms leverage their core operational competencies to secure future growth in adjacent, high-value markets. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitfarms sell its Paraguay facility? Bitfarms sold the facility as part of a strategic shift to reallocate capital from pure Bitcoin mining toward developing infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence, aiming for more diversified and potentially stable revenue streams. Q2: Who purchased the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility? The 70 MW facility in Paso Pe was purchased by Sympatheia Power Fund for a total of $30 million, as reported by GlobeNewswire. Q3: Does this sale mean Bitfarms is exiting Bitcoin mining entirely? No, the sale marks an exit from Latin America, but Bitfarms continues its Bitcoin mining operations in other regions, such as the United States and Canada. The move is a portfolio optimization, not a full exit from the industry. Q4: What is high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure? HPC and AI infrastructure refers to the specialized data centers that house powerful computing clusters (like GPUs and TPUs) used for complex tasks such as scientific research, data analysis, and training artificial intelligence models. These facilities require massive amounts of power and advanced cooling, similar to Bitcoin mining farms. Q5: How might this strategic shift affect Bitfarms’ future financial performance? The shift could lead to a more diversified revenue model with longer-term contracts from HPC/AI hosting, potentially reducing volatility compared to earnings solely dependent on Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty. However, success depends on execution and competition in the new market.

YBTC’s holdings are primarily US Treasury bills, with complex options positions rather than traditional covered calls on Bitcoin ETFs. We go over the return profile to illustrate why most covered call funds don't pass our tests. Today, we will focus on Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). According to their website, this is what it does. The Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF is the first U.S. listed bitcoin covered call ETF. 1 The Fund offers exposure to exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) that have direct exposure to bitcoin * , subject to a cap, while providing the potential for current income. YBTC is an actively-managed ETF. Source: Roundhill The fund does not directly ""invest"" (we have to use the quotes here) in Bitcoin but uses exchange-traded products. When we read that, we thought it might just hold a Bitcoin ETF and then sell calls on that. You probably thought the same. Instead, when we examine the holdings, they present a drastically different picture. YBTC Their current AUM is around $224 million, so the entire AUM is invested in US Treasury bills. A tiny portion is also invested in Government Treasury mutual fund ($143,176), and some is held as cash ($798,464). The actual bitcoin-related holdings are strange, to say the least. Here's the first one. YBTC This appears to be a purchased call option. Normally with covered call funds, you would expect to see the underlying ETF, which in this case is iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), and then a call sold. So this would then appear with a negative sign. A purchased call is the opposite of what you would expect these funds to do. This is also right at the money ($49.72 strike) and close to expiration (Jan 16, 2026). Seeking Alpha So if Bitcoin stays here, the entire premium evaporates. That would be a 3.4% loss in one month on equity/AUM. But it gets more interesting. Against that purchased call, there is a sold call. This expires on January 2, 2026, and is of a higher strike price of $51.30. YBTC So the fund has created a long calendar call spread. Not something you would see in a typical covered call fund. This then brings us to our final position, which is one where significant premiums are sold. The fund has 45,048 contracts of the $49.72 put. YBTC For those that are unaware, cash-secured puts are identical to covered calls, adjusted for market interest rates. So if you sell a cash-secured put and in the interim park your money in a Treasury bill, you should get the same return profile as buying the stock and selling the identical strike covered call. There are some nuances depending on dividends and early exercise probabilities, but that all is not something we have to even think about with Bitcoin. So the overall position here is strange in some ways, as the fund did cash-secured puts for Bitcoin and then used that money to buy calls, partially offset by a calendar spread. Of course this is all just a moment in time, so we have no idea how this strategy has been changed over the course of the fund's history. What we do have is the pudding, where we can look for the proof. The Pudding If you run the price return profiles of IBIT and YBTC, you get a rather glaring contrast. Data by YCharts Of course the investor is now going, ""Wait, you didn't count my fat dividend checks."" We get that, and we will get to that. We always like to see this part first, as it gets to this decay principle where funds struggle to make the same dollars they did on day one as their NAV goes down. Now, there are some income investors who feel the rules of math don't apply. They seem to believe a fund with a $100 NAV per share can generate the same income even after its NAV drops 50%. But we made it past fourth grade (on the second attempt), so that is not a problem for us. Getting back to the total returns, we see that YBTC has been a real problem child here, lagging IBIT by a lot since inception. Data by YCharts That is a lot of ground to give up. The truly fascinating aspect about this fund is that it has delivered worse total returns in the recent bear market. Data by YCharts That's right. The fund has actually lagged IBIT during a rather steep drop. Verdict You couldn't pay us to speculate on Bitcoin. But if you are doing that, buy Bitcoin or IBIT and do your own covered calls. There are ways to do this intelligently that reduce your risk and improve your returns. Funds focused on generating income tend to miss the forest for the trees. There is too much emphasis on selling premiums rather than asking whether it is the right time to sell premiums. At the minimum, such funds should outperform strongly during bear markets to justify the loss of upside. You have to deliver on Sharpe if you can't deliver on Beta. Based on our opinion on Bitcoin and covered call funds and the data we have seen on this fund, we rate this a Strong Sell. Please note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult a professional who knows their objectives and constraints.

The company said it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with Sympatheia Power Fund, which is managed by Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. The transaction is expected to close within 60 days, subject to customary closing conditions. Refocus on North American HPC and AI Infrastructure Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon said the sale represents a decisive rebalancing of the company’s energy portfolio toward North America, allowing capital to be redeployed into higher-return opportunities. “This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC and AI energy infrastructure in 2026,” Gagnon said in a press release. He added that the sale of the Paso Pe site marks the culmination of a broader effort to exit Latin America and refocus the company’s management capital and operational priorities on North American power and infrastructure. Bitfarms Ditches BTC for AI After Shocking $46M Loss Bitfarms said it has increasingly positioned itself as an energy and digital infrastructure company expanding beyond bitcoin mining into high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, which it believes offer more long-term returns on invested capital. In November, the company said it will wind down its Bitcoin operations over 2026 and 2027 after posting a steep $46 million loss in the third quarter, nearly double its $24 million loss during the same period last year. @Bitfarms_io shares dropped 18% as it announced a wind-down in $BTC operations to pivot to AI infrastructure after a $46M Q3 loss. #Bitcoin #AI https://t.co/3Q7tsldFzS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Deal Structure and Payment Timeline Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer will acquire the shares of a single-purpose subsidiary that holds all operating assets related to the Paso Pe project. The proposed transaction values the site at up to $30 million. Bitfarms expects to receive $9 million in cash at closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. This amount includes a $1 million non-refundable deposit that has already been paid by the buyer. The company may receive up to an additional $21 million over the ten months following closing, contingent on the achievement of certain payment milestones. The structure of the transaction is expected to improve Bitfarms’ liquidity profile by accelerating the monetization of the asset while providing short-term financing supported by the operation. Buyer Targets Operational Continuity A representative for Sympatheia Power Fund said the acquisition supports the fund’s regional expansion strategy in crypto infrastructure and emphasized the importance of a smooth transition. “Our priority is an uninterrupted, seamless transition from day one, maintaining continuity at Paso Pe as we move into the next phase of growth,” said SPF representative Josh Murchie. Updated Energy Portfolio Post-Sale Following completion of the transaction, Bitfarms’ energy portfolio will be entirely North America–based. The company said it will operate 341 megawatts of energized capacity with an additional 430 megawatts under active development in the United States. Its total multi-year pipeline stands at 2.1 gigawatts, with roughly 90% located in the U.S. The post Bitfarms to Exit Latin America Selling 70 MW Paraguay Mining Site for Up to $30M appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitfarms|Mining|Paraguay,BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Traders on Polymarket appear cautious, while some big-name firms keep calling for big gains in 2026. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Market Odds And Trader Caution According to Polymarket prices, Bitcoin has just a 23% chance of reaching $150,000 before 2027. The odds are higher at lower targets: 47% for $120,000, 35% for $130,000 and 29% for $140,000. Traders are most comfortable with $100,000, which carries about an 80% chance. That spread shows bettors are pricing risk tightly as the clock runs toward the new year. Bitcoin closed 2025 in the red, a fact that has likely cooled some enthusiasm. Reports have disclosed that gold and silver hit fresh highs in the fourth quarter of 2025, while crypto prices held mostly flat. The old four-year halving cycle that many chartists relied on is being questioned, and that doubt is being priced in. Technical Signals Based on the latest Bitcoin price outlook, BTC is expected to climb 3% to about $91,815 by February 1, 2026. Technical signals point to a Bearish mood, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 28, reflecting Fear. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin posted gains on 15 of those days, or 50%, with price swings averaging 2%. Policy Shifts Could Change The Math US President Donald Trump is expected to name a new Federal Reserve chair soon, and many market participants are betting that interest rates will be cut afterward. That idea has already helped send precious metals higher. At the same time, regulators in Washington are pushing crypto bills such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, which backers say could give clearer rules and, in time, more institutional interest. Analysts Still Offer Bullish Targets Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly predicted that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of 2026, citing stronger institutional interest and better regulatory clarity as reasons for his bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bear Market Might Not Be New: Data Points To A 2-Month Slide Analysts at JPMorgan have suggested a theoretical Bitcoin price around $170,000 in 2026, based on a model comparing Bitcoin’s behavior to gold and assuming continued capital flows into the crypto market. Grayscale’s 2026 digital asset outlook expects Bitcoin to exceed its previous all-time high in the first half of 2026, implying a move above its record peak of around $126,000 (though not giving a specific numerical target, the implication is toward significant upward momentum). Policymakers, traders and analysts are all weighing different risks. Market prices reflect caution today, while forecasts offer a brighter view for the months ahead. Which one proves right will depend on policy moves, investor appetite and whether new trading patterns replace the cycle many thought they could count on.

The pledge arrives as South Korea’s financial regulator and central bank remain locked in a prolonged dispute over stablecoin issuance rules that have pushed comprehensive digital asset legislation into next year. According to the local report, Jeong told attendees at the Korea Exchange’s Seoul headquarters that new investment products, including virtual asset ETFs and derivatives, would be introduced as part of efforts to overcome the “ Korea Discount ” and upgrade the capital market. He also committed to deploying AI-based monitoring systems and strengthening crackdowns on stock manipulation through a joint response team. Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo. | Source: Yonhap Korea Exchange Ready, Regulators Still Divided The Korea Exchange’s readiness to launch crypto products contrasts sharply with regulatory delays that have stretched back years. The Financial Services Commission submitted a roadmap in June proposing spot crypto ETFs for late 2025, but the plan has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, South Korea’s comprehensive Digital Asset Basic Act remains stalled in 2026 after the Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea failed to reach an agreement on stablecoin governance . The central bank insists that stablecoins should be issued only by bank-led consortia, with lenders holding at least a 51% ownership stake. The FSC has resisted the fixed threshold, warning it could sideline technology firms and slow innovation in digital payments. Regulators also disagree on whether a new licensing committee is needed for stablecoin oversight. Beyond stablecoins, the draft law would introduce strict investor protections, including full-reserve custody requirements, and raise compliance standards for crypto service providers to match those in traditional finance. Initial coin offerings banned since 2017 could return under strict disclosure rules. Stablecoin issuers would be required to hold reserves entirely in bank deposits or government bonds, with 100% of those reserves entrusted to licensed custodians. South Korea’s comprehensive crypto law has been delayed to 2026 due to a dispute over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/jKP9L9n63S — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 The regulatory impasse continues despite strong political momentum from President Lee Jae-myung’s administration, which campaigned on easing digital asset restrictions. The ruling Democratic Party introduced legislation in June to amend the Capital Markets Act, expanding the definition of underlying assets for ETFs to include Bitcoin and other digital currencies. A separate bill proposed legalizing stablecoin issuance by domestic firms with a minimum capital of 500 million won. However, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has opposed the development of non-bank stablecoins due to monetary policy concerns. Enforcement Drive Continues Across Major Exchanges While policy debates drag on, enforcement actions have accelerated. The Financial Intelligence Unit imposed a ₩27.3 billion fine on Korbit in late December following approximately 22,000 anti-money laundering violations identified during October inspections. The regulator found failures in customer identification, unauthorized transactions with unregistered overseas platforms, and inadequate money-laundering risk assessments for new products. The Korbit penalty followed earlier sanctions against Upbit operator Dunamu, which received a three-month suspension on new customer accounts in February and a ₩35.2 billion fine in November. Bithumb, Coinone, and GOPAX remain under review as the FIU works through cases in inspection order, with total fines across the sector expected to reach hundreds of billions of won. South Korea is set to hit major crypto exchanges with new penalties over anti-money laundering failures, signaling a tougher enforcement phase for the industry. #SouthKorea #CryptoAML https://t.co/9r42trYMmE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Authorities are simultaneously expanding transaction monitoring requirements. The same late last month, a task force led by the FIU is reviewing whether to extend the travel rule to cover crypto transfers below 1 million won, closing a gap regulators say has enabled smurfing techniques used to evade reporting thresholds. The proposed changes would require exchanges to collect sender and recipient information for all virtual asset transfers, regardless of size. Mixed Signals From Financial Authorities The regulatory uncertainty has created contradictory guidance for asset managers. In July, the Financial Supervisory Service issued verbal warnings restricting the proportion of crypto-related stocks , such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, in domestic ETF portfolios, citing administrative guidance from 2017 that remains in effect. Several Korean ETFs already hold double-digit allocations to these companies through passive index tracking. However, industry participants argued that the restrictions create unfair advantages for US-listed crypto products while failing to prevent capital outflows. “Restricting only domestic ETFs will not stop the flow of funds, and in reality, many investors are already bypassing the market with U.S. ETFs,” one source noted at the time.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,750, meaning it closed the year 2025 below $100,000. This price action has added pressure to sentiment, and higher-timeframe indicators are pointing to growing exhaustion. According to a 3-month candlestick analysis shared on X by analyst Greeny, the way Bitcoin closed 2025 may carry deeper implications than most traders currently understand. 3-Month Bearish Engulfing Points To Weakness Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe shows the cryptocurrency just printed a large bearish engulfing candle that fully overtook the prior quarterly advance. This type of candle is rare on such a high timeframe and typically points to a decisive shift in control from buyers to sellers. The chart shared by Greeny shows that this engulfing structure formed after Bitcoin failed to hold above its 2025 highs above $120,000 in October, and this shows that the year ended in distribution. Interestingly, $106,700 is now an important level moving forward because it corresponds with the bottom of the previous 3-month candle. With Bitcoin now trading below that zone, it flips from support into a heavy resistance area for price action in Q1. Any recovery attempt in early 2026 would need to reclaim this level convincingly to avoid further rejection. Furthermore, the stochastic level near $108,000 is another important level to look at for Bitcoin’s price action in Q1 2026. According to Greeny, if the Bitcoin price closes below this zone after the first quarter, it would indicate continued downside pressure. Together, these levels form a tight ceiling overhead, meaning even strong relief rallies could struggle to transition into sustainable uptrends as we move into the new year. Bitcoin 3-month Candlestick Price Chart: @greenytrades on X Stochastic Exhaustion Points To A Possible Cycle Peak Another concerning element of Greeny’s analysis centers on the stochastic indicator. According to the analyst, this is the first time in Bitcoin’s history that the stochastic has reached the 80th percentile on the 3-month timeframe. This is otherwise notable because this is a zone generally associated with exhaustion and a local or bull cycle top. The chart also shows the red moving average crossing above the blue while sitting well below the stochastic band, a configuration Greeny interprets as confirmation of a local top. This setup is likely pointing to the end of the current bull cycle and will only be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to close above $108,000 by the end of March. Liquidity conditions across the entire crypto market tightened through late 2025 as the Central Bank of Japan maintained higher interest rates. This has led to Bitcoin underperforming compared to other notable assets, while precious metals such as gold and silver pushed to new price highs.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Specifically, respected on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez claims to have identified a Bitcoin death cross using the 10 and 50-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), per an X article published on January 1. Within the same article, the analyst explained that, in the past, such a signal preceded a BTC crash of between 53% – as in March of 2020 – and 67% – like in September of 2014. Historically, every Bitcoin $BTC death cross between the 10W and 50W SMA has led to a major correction: • Sep 2014: –67% • Jun 2018: –54% • Mar 2020: –53% • Jan 2022: –64% https://t.co/EWSDQeujJt pic.twitter.com/CEGle2ExXd — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 2, 2026 Simultaneously, Martinez explained he expects that a Bitcoin correction to between $38,000 and $50,000 – between 57% and 44% from the press time value – is likely. Still, the trading expert also noted with his BTC prediction that, rather than a purely detrimental situation, such a crash would once again turn Bitcoin into an attractive long-term investment. The pullback would all but ensure that the cryptocurrency’s upside potential is significantly greater than the downward pressure. Top commodity strategist forecasts massive 2026 Bitcoin crash On the other hand, hopeful BTC traders might have to wait until at least 2027 to again witness a major rally. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s senior commodity analyst, explained that he expects Bitcoin might crash toward $50,000 in 2026. He also revealed that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the cryptocurrency market – fell 19% in 2025, hinting at a more persistent downtrend. Bitcoin just broke a decade-long cycle Lastly, Bitcoin’s actual performance for the entire 2025 also indicates that the boom is, for the time being, over. Simultaneously, it showcased that the cryptocurrency market might be even harder to predict in the future. BTC 12-month price chart.

This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling discussions about its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this rally, from macroeconomic shifts to institutional adoption trends. Bitcoin Price Breaches a Critical Threshold The ascent of the Bitcoin price above $90,000 marks a new chapter in its volatile history. This movement is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of sustained buying pressure observed over recent weeks. Data from multiple trading platforms confirms the breakout, with Binance’s USDT pair serving as a key liquidity benchmark for the global market. Furthermore, this price action follows a period of consolidation below previous resistance levels, suggesting a fundamental shift in market sentiment. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a pattern of reaching round-number milestones that later become support zones. The journey from $70,000 to this new high involved navigating regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data releases, and shifting investor risk appetites. For instance, the asset’s performance often correlates inversely with traditional market fears, positioning it as a potential hedge for some portfolios. Therefore, the breach of $90,000 is being analyzed through both technical chart patterns and broader economic narratives. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Several interconnected factors are contributing to the current cryptocurrency rally. Primarily, renewed institutional interest has provided substantial buy-side volume. Major asset managers have continued to expand their digital asset offerings, channeling traditional capital into the space. Simultaneously, macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about currency devaluation and inflation in certain regions, have driven retail and institutional investors toward scarce digital assets. Institutional Adoption: Increased integration by payment processors and treasury allocations by public companies. Macroeconomic Hedge: Perceived as a digital store of value amid expansive fiscal policies. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements to the Bitcoin protocol enhancing its utility and security. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in key jurisdictions providing a more stable framework for investment. Moreover, the supply dynamics of Bitcoin play a crucial role. The predictable, diminishing rate of new coin issuance—a process known as the halving—creates a built-in scarcity mechanism. As adoption increases against this constrained supply, basic economic principles of supply and demand exert upward pressure on the Bitcoin price. This fundamental aspect distinguishes it from traditional fiat currencies and remains a core tenet of its investment thesis. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of volume and derivative market positioning in assessing the rally’s health. Notably, open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen alongside the price, but funding rates have remained relatively neutral. This suggests a balance between long and short positions, potentially indicating a healthier, less speculative advance compared to past parabolic moves. Experts from major financial research firms point to on-chain data, such as the growth in long-term holder supply and low exchange reserves, as signs of strong conviction among investors. Comparatively, the current rally exhibits distinct characteristics from the 2021 bull market. The table below outlines key differences: Market Aspect 2021 Cycle 2025 Cycle (Current) Primary Drivers Retail frenzy, meme coins, excessive leverage Institutional inflows, ETF products, macroeconomic narrative Leverage Levels Extremely High Moderate to High Regulatory Environment Highly uncertain Evolving with clearer frameworks On-chain Holder Behavior High exchange inflows Accumulation & withdrawal to cold storage This shift in market structure implies a potentially more mature and stable foundation for current price levels. However, analysts universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Risk management, therefore, is paramount for all market participants. The Ripple Effect Across Digital Asset Markets The breakthrough in the Bitcoin price invariably influences the broader digital asset ecosystem. Often termed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s performance frequently sets the tone for altcoins and other blockchain-based assets. In this instance, the rally has restored overall market capitalization to levels not seen in years, improving liquidity and investor confidence across the board. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have often shown correlated momentum, though the strength of this correlation can vary based on independent network developments. Simultaneously, the infrastructure surrounding cryptocurrency continues to evolve rapidly. Custodial services, regulatory-compliant exchanges, and financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs have created more accessible pathways for traditional capital. This institutional gateway effect is a critical component of the current market phase, differentiating it from earlier cycles dominated primarily by retail traders on less regulated platforms. The growing integration with legacy finance presents both opportunities for growth and new complexities regarding systemic interconnectedness. Conclusion The Bitcoin price surpassing $90,000 is a definitive milestone, reflecting a complex interplay of adoption, macroeconomics, and technological maturity. This achievement underscores Bitcoin’s persistent resilience and its growing absorption into the broader financial conversation. While volatility remains a defining feature, the market’s underlying structure appears to be evolving toward greater participation and sophistication. Ultimately, the journey toward and beyond this price point will be closely watched as a barometer for the entire digital asset class’s integration into the global economic system. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $90,040 on Binance USDT mean? This means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin (BTC) can be purchased or sold for 90,040 Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is a key pricing pair that reflects real-time global supply and demand. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin’s price is rising? Primary drivers include increased institutional investment through new financial products, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, continued adoption as a payment method, and its fixed, scarce supply schedule which contrasts with expansive monetary policy. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s current rally compare to 2021? The current rally appears more institutionally driven, with significant capital flowing through regulated ETFs and corporate treasuries. In contrast, the 2021 peak was characterized by higher retail leverage and excitement around meme coins and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Q4: Is Bitcoin’s price sustainable at this level? Sustainability depends on continued adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. While on-chain data and institutional interest provide a stronger foundation now, cryptocurrency markets are still young and subject to high volatility and unpredictable corrections. Q5: What is the impact of Bitcoin’s price on other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the overall market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin price typically increases capital flows into the entire crypto sector, boosting the prices of major altcoins. However, individual project fundamentals ultimately determine long-term performance relative to Bitcoin.

This surprising turn of events, reported by DL News in early 2025, follows his November 2024 sentencing to five years for orchestrating one of cryptocurrency’s most infamous thefts. Consequently, his release under the U.S. First Step Act raises profound questions about justice, rehabilitation, and the evolving legal landscape for digital asset crimes. Bitfinex Hacker Early Release Details and Legal Mechanism The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Ilya Lichtenstein’s early release this week. Authorities applied provisions of the First Step Act of 2018. This bipartisan federal law specifically aims to reduce recidivism. Furthermore, it promotes inmate rehabilitation through earned time credits. Lichtenstein reportedly qualified for these credits by participating in prison programming. His original five-year sentence stemmed from a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges connected directly to the 2016 Bitfinex security breach. Prosecutors originally charged Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, in February 2022. Their arrest followed a multi-year investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Agents traced the movement of 119,754 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the theft, the cryptocurrency was worth approximately $71 million. However, by the time of their arrest, its value had ballooned to a staggering $4.5 billion. This case remains one of the largest financial seizures in U.S. history. The 2016 Bitfinex Breach and Investigation Timeline Understanding the early release requires examining the original crime’s scale. The Bitfinex hack occurred on August 2, 2016. Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the exchange’s multi-signature wallet service. They successfully initiated over 2,000 unauthorized transactions. These transactions drained customer and corporate funds. The exchange immediately suspended all trading. It also announced a 36% socialized loss across all user accounts. For nearly six years, the stolen funds remained dormant. Then, in 2022, blockchain analytics and traditional investigative work converged. The IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit and HSI followed a complex trail. They linked the funds to wallets controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. A court-authorized search of their cloud storage accounts revealed private keys. These keys directly accessed the wallets holding the stolen Bitcoin. Key Events in the Bitfinex Case Date Event Aug 2, 2016 Bitfinex hack occurs; 119,754 BTC stolen. Feb 8, 2022 Lichtenstein and Morgan arrested in New York. Aug 2022 Both plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy. Nov 2024 Lichtenstein sentenced to 5 years in prison. Early 2025 Early release granted under First Step Act. The investigation showcased unprecedented collaboration. Agencies combined blockchain forensic tools with classic financial sleuthing. This approach set a new standard for prosecuting cryptocurrency crimes. First Step Act Provisions and Application to Cybercrime The First Step Act represents a significant shift in federal sentencing policy. Its primary goals include: Reducing mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenses. Expanding early release programs through earned time credits. Increasing rehabilitation programming within federal prisons. Improving conditions and reducing recidivism rates. Inmates earn credits by participating in Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) programs. These programs address needs like vocational training, education, and substance abuse treatment. Lichtenstein’s eligibility suggests he engaged with such programming. The Act does not distinguish between crime types for credit eligibility. Therefore, non-violent financial crimes like money laundering qualify. This application to a high-profile cybercrime case is particularly noteworthy. Impact on Cryptocurrency Security and Legal Precedents Lichtenstein’s early release sends ripples through the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, it tests the deterrent effect of prosecution for digital asset theft. Secondly, it highlights the tension between punishment and rehabilitation for technical crimes. The case already established several key legal precedents: Asset Forfeiture: The government successfully seized and sold billions in stolen crypto. Jurisdiction: U.S. courts asserted authority over crimes involving globally dispersed digital assets. Investigation Methods: The use of blockchain analytics as evidence gained judicial acceptance. Security experts note the hack forced major exchanges to overhaul their protocols. Today, most leading platforms use sophisticated cold storage solutions. They also employ multi-party computation (MPC) for key management. The Bitfinex incident remains a cautionary tale for the entire industry. Expert Analysis on Sentencing and Release Legal scholars specializing in cyberlaw offer critical perspectives. Professor Elena Carter of Stanford Law School notes, “The First Step Act focuses on rehabilitation for non-violent offenders. The court likely viewed the technical nature of the crime as non-violent, despite its massive financial scale.” Meanwhile, blockchain forensic analyst David Chen observes, “This early release doesn’t diminish the investigative breakthrough. The real victory was tracing and recovering the funds, which returned value to victims.” The case also involved Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, a rapper and entrepreneur. She received a shorter sentence and was released earlier. Their combined story of tech savvy, money laundering through complex transactions, and unconventional public personas captured global media attention. Conclusion The early release of Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein under the First Step Act concludes a landmark chapter in cryptocurrency legal history. This case demonstrated the formidable reach of U.S. law enforcement into the blockchain. It also tested new sentencing reforms on a high-stakes financial crime. Ultimately, the recovery of $4.5 billion in stolen assets stands as the investigation’s enduring legacy. The industry now watches how this precedent influences future prosecutions of digital asset theft and money laundering. FAQs Q1: What was the First Step Act, and why did it apply to Ilya Lichtenstein? The First Step Act is a 2018 U.S. federal law designed to reform sentencing and promote inmate rehabilitation. It applied to Lichtenstein because he qualified for earned time credits by participating in prison programming aimed at reducing recidivism, and his crime was classified as non-violent. Q2: How much Bitcoin was originally stolen in the 2016 Bitfinex hack? The hackers stole 119,754 Bitcoin from Bitfinex in August 2016. At the time of the theft, this was worth about $71 million. By the time of the arrest in 2022, the value had appreciated to approximately $4.5 billion. Q3: What happened to the stolen Bitcoin after the seizure? The U.S. government successfully seized the vast majority of the stolen Bitcoin. It then sold portions of the cryptocurrency through authorized auctions and market sales. The proceeds are held as recovered assets, with processes in place for potential victim restitution. Q4: How does this early release affect future cryptocurrency crime prosecutions? Legal experts believe the core precedent—successful investigation, seizure, and conviction—remains intact. The early release reflects sentencing policy, not investigative failure. It may, however, influence plea negotiations and sentencing arguments in future digital asset cases. Q5: What role did Ilya Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, play in the crime? Heather Morgan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and defraud the United States. Prosecutors alleged she helped launder the stolen funds through complex transactions, shell companies, and false invoices. She received a sentence shorter than Lichtenstein’s and was released earlier.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,961.21 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This sudden Bitcoin price movement has captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, prompting a deep dive into the underlying market mechanics and historical context. The drop represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and introduces fresh volatility into the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The descent below $89,000 marks a clear technical breakdown. Consequently, market participants are now scrutinizing order book liquidity and exchange flows. Major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken show similar price action, confirming a broad-based sell-off. Furthermore, the 24-hour trading volume has spiked by approximately 35%, indicating heightened activity. This Bitcoin price decline follows a period of consolidation just above the $90,000 psychological barrier. Market data reveals increased selling pressure from large wallet addresses, often called ‘whales.’ Historically, such movements often correlate with broader financial conditions. For instance, the current macroeconomic backdrop includes shifting expectations around central bank policies. Analysts frequently compare present volatility to past cycles, like the Q2 2024 correction. A short-term sell-off can sometimes establish a stronger foundation for future growth. Therefore, understanding the immediate catalysts is crucial for a complete market picture. Technical Indicators and On-Chain Data Key technical levels provide further insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory. The 50-day moving average, a closely watched metric, now acts as dynamic resistance. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory. On-chain analytics from Glassnode show a net outflow from exchanges, suggesting some investors are moving holdings to cold storage. This ‘hodling’ behavior often signals long-term conviction despite short-term price pain. The network’s hash rate remains robust, underscoring fundamental security strength. Analyzing Potential Catalysts for the Decline Several interrelated factors may have contributed to this cryptocurrency market downturn. First, regulatory developments continue to create uncertainty in major economies. Second, profit-taking after a sustained rally above $85,000 was a widely anticipated risk. Third, movements in traditional markets, like bond yields or equity indices, can trigger correlated sell-offs in digital assets. Finally, leveraged positions being liquidated on derivatives exchanges can exacerbate downward momentum. It is essential to distinguish between causation and correlation. For example, not every market move has a single, identifiable news trigger. Often, a confluence of minor factors creates the conditions for a shift. Market sentiment, measured by tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, had been in ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. A reversion to a more neutral or fearful reading is a common market-clearing event. Macroeconomic Pressure: Shifts in inflation data or interest rate expectations. Overleveraged Markets: Cascade of long position liquidations on futures platforms. Regulatory Headlines: News flow concerning digital asset legislation or enforcement actions. Profit-Taking: Natural sell pressure after a multi-week appreciation cycle. Historical Volatility and Bitcoin Market Cycles Bitcoin’s history is defined by volatility. A pullback of 5-15% during a bull market phase is statistically normal. For context, the 2021 cycle saw over a dozen corrections exceeding 10% before reaching its all-time high. This perspective helps investors maintain a long-term view. The current Bitcoin price action fits within established patterns of advance, consolidation, and correction. Seasoned analysts often view these dips as potential entry points rather than signals of a trend reversal, provided core fundamentals remain intact. Comparing asset classes highlights Bitcoin’s unique risk profile. Traditional safe-haven assets like gold typically exhibit lower volatility. However, Bitcoin’s potential for asymmetric returns attracts a different investor profile. The digital gold narrative persists, but its trading patterns remain distinct. This latest move serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent price discovery process, which is often volatile and inefficient. Expert Commentary and Market Sentiment Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize context. ‘Market corrections are healthy,’ notes a veteran trader from a major digital asset fund. ‘They flush out weak leverage and reset derivatives markets.’ Another analyst points to on-chain metrics showing accumulation by long-term holders during dips. This behavior suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Sentiment on social trading platforms has quickly shifted from bullish to cautious, reflecting the fast-paced nature of crypto markets. Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The Bitcoin price decline has a pronounced ripple effect. Altcoins, which often correlate with BTC, have generally moved in tandem, with some experiencing more severe losses. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dipped accordingly. However, this correlation sometimes decouples, with select projects showcasing independent strength. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) trading volumes may see secondary impacts if the downturn persists. Institutional investment flows, tracked through products like Bitcoin ETFs, will be a key metric to watch in the coming days. Sustained inflows during a price drop could signal strong institutional conviction. Conversely, outflows might indicate a broader risk-off move. The interaction between spot market selling and derivatives market liquidations creates a complex feedback loop that analysts will study closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $89,000 represents a significant moment in the 2025 market cycle. This movement underscores the volatile and interconnected nature of digital asset markets. While short-term price action captures headlines, the long-term narrative around Bitcoin’s adoption, technological development, and role as a digital store of value remains multifaceted. Investors are advised to focus on risk management, fundamental research, and a time horizon that aligns with their financial goals. The coming days will be critical for observing whether this level holds as support or if further downside exploration occurs. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $89,000? The decline likely resulted from a combination of profit-taking after a rally, liquidations of leveraged long positions, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. It is a typical correction within a volatile market. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual strategy. Some view corrections as potential buying opportunities, but timing the market is notoriously difficult. Conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q3: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major altcoins have high correlation with Bitcoin and often move in the same direction, at least in the short term. The entire crypto market cap typically reacts to significant BTC movements. Q4: What key level should traders watch next? Traders are monitoring the $88,000 and $85,000 levels as potential next supports. A reclaim of $90,000 would be viewed as a bullish signal for a potential recovery. Q5: Does this price drop change Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? A single price correction rarely alters long-term fundamental theses based on adoption, scarcity, and utility. Volatility is an inherent feature of the asset class, and long-term investors often look through short-term fluctuations.

The facility will be acquired by the Sympatheia Power Fund, a crypto infrastructure investor. Bitfarms will sell its 70 MW facility in Paraguay, as it rebalances its portfolio of reliable centers and focuses on North America. With the sale, Bitfarms leaves its South American mining operations. The Paso Pe site in Paraguay is expected to transfer within 60 days, under the management of the Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. ‘ I’m pleased to announce the strategic sale of our Paso Pe site and decisive rebalancing of our energy portfolio to 100% North American. This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC/AI energy infrastructure in 2026, where we believe we will be able to generate much stronger returns on our invested capital with HPC/AI, ’ said Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon. Bitfarms is a mid-range mining company with 19.5 EH/s in total BTC mining power. The company is also within the top 100 of BTC treasury holders, retaining 1,827 BTC from its mining activity. The Paraguay center will go toward Sympatheia Power Fund’s expansion plans for Latin America. The mining center will retain operations, with no outages during the transfer of ownership. Bitfarms sells BTC mining center for $30M Bitfarms will sell the Paso Pe BTC mining facility at a $30M valuation, with $9M in cash and up to $21M over a 10-month period. After the deal, Bitfarms will focus solely on North American energy assets while improving its liquidity profile for further expansion. Bitfarms negotiated a $300M long-term debt facility in April 2025 as part of its energy expansion plans. Bitfarms retains 341 MW in energy capacity, with another 430 MW in active development. The multi-year plan is to reach a total of 2.1 GW in data centers, of which 90% will be based in the USA. Bitfarms has been on an expansion track since 2017, and is one of the leaders in North American mining infrastructure. Bitfarms benefits from AI data center boom The sale arrives at a time when Bitcoin mining operations are often converted to high-uptime AI centers, based on existing contracts for reliable electricity. Following the deal announcement, BITF shares were trading at $2.96 (3.93 CAD), up over 32% net for the past year. The period coincided with revenue growth for BITF, as the miner benefited from the growing prices. In early 2026, BTC miners are still operating at near peak capacity, despite the distressing market conditions. Even smaller mining companies are viewed as potential bets with high returns. BITF is expected to break out based on its ongoing data center plans. BITF is competing with other recently hot mining companies like Riot and IREN, with stocks rising despite the slower BTC market growth. Get seen where it counts.

The cryptocurrency’s price actions have been choppy and uncertain for several weeks. It dipped to a local low of $84,500 on December 19, shortly after the US CPI numbers for November came out, but quickly tightened its trading range. In the following ten days or so, it stood between $90,500 and $86,500. It tried to take down the upper boundary on at least three occasions since then, but each attempt was met with an immediate rejection and a subsequent retracement to the lower boundary. The current business week began similarly, as BTC spiked to $90,500, where the bears stepped up and pushed it south to under $87,000. The bulls intercepted the move and provided an immediate relief rally to $88,000. Sideways action continued in the following days, but BTC ultimately closed 2025 below $88,000, which was a 6-7% yearly decline. January 1 was expectedly a dull trading day, but bitcoin went on the offensive earlier today. It tapped $90,000 once again, only to be stopped and driven south by a grand and a half. Nevertheless, it has managed to bounce off and now sits above $89,000. This means that it’s over 2% up weekly, but its market cap has declined by 0.6% weekly as most alts have marked bigger gains since last Friday. These include ETH, BNB, SOL, and ADA, all of which are up by 5-6%. DOGE has risen by more than 9%, and so has ZEC. XMR, HYPE, and BCH are among the few alts in the red weekly.

As explained above, BTC finished 2025 in the red. While that’s not a first, it did break history as bitcoin had never ended a post-halving year with a negative performance until now. The $10,000 Trump Trade: What Actually Made Money Since Inauguration Day . Trump re-entered the White House on the white crypto horse due to his multiple promises. However, data from almost a year later shows that none of the larger-cap digital assets were in the green, unlike the US stock market or, even better, the precious metal industry. Ethereum Suffered Worst Year Since 2018: 9 Red Months in 2025 . The second-largest cryptocurrency also tapped a new all-time high in 2025, but its overall performance was quite the opposite. It saw nine monthly closures in the red, which made it its worst year since 2018. Tether Confirms $779M Bitcoin Purchase Despite Weak Market Momentum . The Paolo Ardoino-led stablecoin giant continues to accumulate BTC on a frequent basis, buying 8,888.8888888 units in Q4 2025.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-ignore-xrp-at-your-peril-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Crypto markets often hide the most important moves behind quiet accumulation rather than flashy headlines. While retail chatter and media narratives dominate daily attention, institutional actors frequently position themselves well ahead of obvious catalysts . XRP now sits at one of these critical inflection points, signaling that large-scale players may be preparing for a major market shift. The insight came from X Finance Bull, who shared recent institutional flow data on X, highlighting XRP’s unusual stability compared to other top cryptocurrencies. According to the analysis, while Bitcoin and Ethereum saw billions in outflows over November and December 2025, XRP maintained steady net inflows, signaling deliberate accumulation rather than retail-driven speculation. Institutional Flows Highlight Strategic Positioning X Finance Bull pointed out that Bitcoin experienced $3.48 billion in outflows in November and $1.09 billion in December, while Ethereum lost $1.42 billion and $616 million in the same period. XRP, however, saw only $666 million in November and $499 million in December, all positive net inflows. These numbers suggest that institutions actively moved capital into XRP while other major assets faced liquidity drains. IGNORE $XRP AT YOUR PERIL INSTITUTIONS ARE FRONT-RUNNING THE MARKET If you still think ETFs are only about Bitcoin and Ethereum, you’re missing what’s right in front of you Bitcoin saw outflows of $3.48B in November and $1.09B in December. Ethereum lost $1.42B in… https://t.co/gC79IXRRoW pic.twitter.com/V35OxMkYFM — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 1, 2026 This pattern demonstrates more than casual interest. Institutions anticipate regulatory clarity, infrastructure upgrades, and new liquidity corridors, often positioning themselves before these changes reach the public eye. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that professional investors view it as a strategically vital asset in the emerging digital finance ecosystem. ETFs and XRP’s Overlooked Potential Many investors still associate crypto ETFs primarily with Bitcoin and Ethereum. X Finance Bull emphasizes that this narrative overlooks a critical development: institutional capital increasingly targets XRP as regulatory frameworks and market infrastructure evolve. Unlike retail-driven surges, these flows reflect structured positioning in anticipation of XRP’s adoption as a bridge asset in regulated payments and cross-border settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This approach underlines XRP’s growing independence from short-term market sentiment. Institutions prioritize utility, liquidity, and compliance over hype, and XRP now benefits from these long-term fundamentals. Following Capital Flows Over Headlines The data reinforces a key principle: flows often lead markets. While headlines highlight trending stories, institutional movements reveal where smart money expects value to materialize. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that investors are betting on its future as an essential infrastructure asset, rather than short-term gains. As financial institutions integrate blockchain solutions and liquidity corridors expand, XRP stands poised for broader adoption. Ignoring these signals risks missing early positioning in what may become one of the most structurally significant crypto assets in the next market cycle. By tracking institutional flows rather than narratives, market participants gain a clearer perspective on XRP’s strategic importance and its potential to outperform other major cryptocurrencies.

BTC could sell off immediately after the January FOMC meeting, or even sooner. By comparing BTC to changes in factors that influence real yield trajectories, I assert that BTC’s latest rally has been running on borrowed time since September. Regulatory optimism and one-off positive events may support BTC in the short run, but they are unlikely to alter the broader trajectory. This article concludes a three-part BTC series examining dominance trends, money supply dynamics, and real yields—all of which collectively, and independently, point towards a BTC bear phase. Recently, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management increased exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which could be seen as an indication that the coin may rally further. While I believe in BTC’s long-term growth prospects, in line with Ms. Wood's target of $650,000 to $1.5M by 2030 , I don’t believe her recent BTC and related portfolio additions were to benefit from a short-term rally because my analysis of dominance numbers and money supply in previous articles indicated otherwise. Below is a summary of those two articles, which you may skip and move to the next section if you’ve been following my work. On December 18, 2025, my article titled “ Exit 200%+ Yield MSTY - And Don't Look Back ” argued that dominance numbers are signaling a crypto risk-off sentiment. Precisely, the dominance of BTC hasn’t changed since early November, whereas the dominance of altcoins has diminished. In that timeframe, though, stablecoin's dominance has shot up, indicating that many investors now prefer holding cash over crypto. Then, my article titled “ IBIT: The Risk Of Bitcoin's Decline To $30K ,” published on December 22, 2025, established that there’s a strong correlation between expected money supply changes and BTC. I advocated that the Fed may not embark on any meaningful quantitative easing in the coming years. In the absence of such M2 tailwinds, investors will likely rotate out of crypto. More Evidence In my view, those two articles should’ve been enough for readers to reconsider their BTC positions, especially if their entry price was more than $30,000—my price target. Even still, I’ll provide further evidence to support my assertion that BTC is headed south. To that end, please consider the chart below, which plots BTC prices against changes in real yields (referred to as RYC going forward). BTC-USD vs. 10-Year TIPS YoY % Change (Weekly, Sep 2014 – Dec 2025) (Author's Work - Data from Yahoo and FRED) From a surface-level view, the inverse relationship between BTC and RYC is quite evident: when RYC falls, BTC rallies, and vice versa. Also, BTC rallies usually lag RYCs. That inverse relationship exists because BTC is a non-yielding asset, and when yields are expected to rise, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets goes up, diminishing their attractiveness. The pertinent question then is: what drives RYC? Below is a quick rundown of every RYC directional pivot since the pandemic: RYC collapsed at the start of the pandemic due to the Fed’s zero rates and QE-until-necessary policies in response to the looming threat of a severe pandemic-induced recession and deflation. RYC started accelerating in early 2021, driven by rate hike expectations, which in turn were driven by inflation and growth expectations that had risen based on the possibility of vaccine rollouts. Inflation peaked in mid-2022, indicating that the Fed was approaching terminal rates. An expectation that gained further credence when the yield curve inverted in October 2022 , raising fears of an imminent recession. Consequently, RYC commenced a downward leg at the end of 2022, even though the Fed continued to hike rates until July 2023, because changes in both inflation and GDP trended downward. Inflation reached a point of stabilization at the start of 2024, when it fell to ~2.6%, quite close to the Fed's target—an event coupled with a flattening of the GDP change curve as well. But GDP had softened more than anticipated, raising fears and expectations of a weak economy, causing RYC to dive deeper. To manage that adverse situation, the Fed cut rates by 50 bps on September 18, 2024, and then delivered two more cuts in the same year. RYC changed direction in October 2024—when the market ascertained that the economy would be stable and GDP growth would normalize after the Fed's actions. Finally, RYC pivoted downward slightly at the end of 2024 when market participants believed the economy had digested the stimulatory effects of rate cuts. With all that information presented in this section, it is safe to assert that changes in expectations of long-term inflation and growth are among the primary drivers of RYC trajectories and thus, BTC cycles. Important Nuance Note that I have used the words “RYC trajectories” and “expectations of long-term inflation and growth” intentionally because trajectories and expectations are what matter, rather than singular events. If this nuance isn’t taken into consideration, investors may enter or exit positions at inopportune times. One such inopportune time was when rates were cut in October 2025, leading to only a slight drop in RYC but a big drawdown in BTC ($110,000 to roughly $85,000), i.e., the inverse relation between the two didn’t hold. That decoupling occurred because there were no changes in expectations of inflation and/or growth. Plus, Powell said that another rate cut in December is not a “foregone conclusion,” indicating a possible end to the rate cut cycle of 2025 and a stable economy going forward. In fact, it can be said that BTC’s long-haul price rally has been living on borrowed time since the September FOMC meeting, when Powell mentioned that cuts going forward would be more of a risk management initiative because the summary of economic projections hasn’t changed much (reference: Quote 1 in the appendix). Fed’s Path Forward Historically, the Fed has implemented insurance cuts multiple times, totaling 75 bps in all cases. (Source for rate cuts history: Federal Funds Rate History 1990 to 2026 ). In 2019, to manage the adverse effects of a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. In 2002, to further stimulate anemic economic recovery following the Dot-Com crisis. In 1998, to manage risks arising from the Asian Currency Crisis and the collapse of LTCM. In 1995, to stimulate a stagnant and weaker-than-expected labor market. Rates have already been cut by 75 bps since September 2025, which is why it's reasonable to assume that the Fed Funds rate won't change for the foreseeable future. An assertion further supported by the Fed’s latest economic projections , indicating a 2.4% PCE inflation, a GDP growth rate of 2.3%, and a Fed Funds rate of 3.4% for 2026. Moreover, Powell's statements from the October and December FOMC press conferences clearly indicate that if it weren’t for tariffs, inflation would be very close to the Fed’s target of 2% (reference: Quotes 2 and 3 in the appendix). Finally, he has said many times, and something I discussed in an article here , that tariff-induced inflation is a one-off event whose detrimental effects diminish over time. In summary, inflation is projected to subside in the coming months, GDP is projected to grow, and the Fed has delivered most of its rate cuts. Thus, RYC won’t experience any dramatic trajectory changes. Conclusion In my article on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) referenced/linked earlier, I stated that BTC will bottom between $30,000 and $20,000. To reach that level, however, it’ll experience multiple dramatic drawdowns. As mentioned before, I believe that BTC’s last strong sell-off, which caused it to drop from around $110,000 to roughly $85,000 within weeks, occurred because of normalization of growth and inflation, even though a rate cut was delivered. Therefore, I expect another drawdown, causing BTC to drop to its next resistance level of around $60,000, to occur after the next Fed meeting when an end to the current rate-cut cycle is officially announced—eliminating any doubts about the economy deteriorating further. Could the drop happen earlier? Yes, it depends on the payroll numbers and is quite tricky to understand. In my opinion, market participants, as of now, are quite convinced that there won't be any further rate cuts. But there's also some lingering doubt left along the lines of “What if things get worse in the labor market?” If, however, payroll numbers for December were to present a positive surprise, those doubts would be decisively eliminated, along with doubts about the end of the rate cuts cycle. In such a scenario, BTC may crash before the next FOMC meeting. The primary risk to my thesis is what I’ve already stated in other articles: singular events, such as regulatory changes and institutional participation, serving as tailwinds for BTC. I’d, however, like to further qualify that assertion by adding that such changes may only lead to ephemeral BTC rallies because its long-haul use as an extreme inflation hedge would be irrelevant in the coming economic environment. Lastly, it goes without saying that this ‘strong sell’ recommendation is not only for BTC but also for ETFs derived from it, such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), or corporations that are directly correlated to BTC prices, such as Strategy ( MSTR ). Appendix: Quotes From FOMC Press Conferences Quote 1: September press conference (pages 6 and 7): Yeah, I think you could think of this, in a way, as a risk-management cut, because if you look at the SEP, actually the projections for growth this year and next actually ticked up just a little bit and inflation and unemployment didn’t really move. So what’s different now? What’s different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market. You’ve seen—you know, we were looking at 150,000 jobs a month at the time of the last meeting, and now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers. And I didn’t—I don’t want to put too much emphasis on payroll job creation, but it’s just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off. And that tells you that it’s time to take that into account in our, you know, in our policy. Quote 2: October press conference (page 11): One is that inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2 percent goal. We estimate—people have different estimates of what that is, but it might be five- or six-tenths, and so if it’s 2.8, then core PCE, not including tariffs, might be 2.3 or 2.4, in that range, something like that. Quote 3: December press conference (page 23): And I think the evidence is kind of growing that what's happening here is services inflation coming down and that's offset by increases in goods, and that goods inflation is entirely in sectors where there are tariffs. So that does build on the story. And, so far, it's only a story that this is -- that the goods inflation, which is really the source of the excess at this point, that that -- almost more than half the source of the excess inflation is goods -- is tariffs.",BTC-USD|IBIT|BITO|FBTC|GBTC|MSTR|IBIT:CA|MSTR:CA|MSTY|MSTY:CA,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Bitcoin Expected To Revisit $90,000 Levels In 2026 Market technician Jonathan Carter has shared four new price targets for Bitcoin this year, taking on a bullish stance despite the broader market downtrend and ongoing volatility. The analyst first highlighted a technical structure on BTC’s 8-hour chart that suggests a major price move is coming. Related Reading: People Are Not Ready For Bitcoin; Analyst Reveals What’s Coming Next According to his chart analysis, Bitcoin has been forming a symmetrical triangle since December last year and is now approaching a critical decision point as the pattern nears its apex. Notably, this triangle structure has often preceded aggressive directional moves, suggesting that the market may be gearing up for bullish turnover . For his first bullish target, the analyst expects Bitcoin to surge to $94,000, viewing this area as an initial reaction level following a complete breakout above the $80,000 region. Notably, the chart shows that the $94,000 target was a previous consolidation and minor rejection point during earlier market phases. A move into this area would signal that buyers are successfully pushing prices beyond short-term resistance. Closely following that level is the $97,500 target. The chart indicates that this region previously acted as a pivot where the price struggled to maintain momentum. If Bitcoin holds above $97,000, it could also indicate strengthening bullish control and increase the probability of continuation. Carter’s chart shows that both buyers and sellers have been active , but neither side has maintained dominance, resulting in narrower price swings. This balance suggests that the market is consolidating and may be waiting for a trigger to resolve the structure. Although BTC continues to trade around $88,000, Carter believes the cryptocurrency’s broader structure favors an upside continuation. However, he notes that a confirmation is required before the market can break out and recover from the downtrend. Analyst Sets BTC’s Next Two Targets Above $100,000 For his final two targets, Carter has forecasted a move above the $100,000 psychological level . If Bitcoin successfully clears the triangle resistance, the next major objective is the $100,500 level. Beyond that, the analyst has forecasted a final upside target of around $106,000, representing a roughly 19% surge from current levels. Carter has also marked $106,000 as a sell zone , suggesting that a move into this region would likely attract profit taking , but reaching it would confirm a strong bullish expansion from the triangle pattern. Notably, a clearly marked support zone sits near the lower boundary of the triangle around the $80,000 range. This area has been tested multiple times and continues to hold, reinforcing the validity of Bitcoin’s structure.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Jonathan Carter|Profit-taking|Symmetrical Triangle Formation,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling intense discussion among investors and analysts globally. Consequently, this price action prompts a deeper examination of the converging factors behind this rally and its potential implications for the broader financial landscape. Bitcoin Price Achieves a New Zenith The ascent past $90,000 marks Bitcoin’s highest valuation since its last major cycle peak. According to data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the move was characterized by strong buying volume and occurred during Asian and European trading hours. This price level consolidates gains from a multi-week uptrend that began in early 2025. Furthermore, the rally appears broad-based, with increased institutional activity noted across major regulated exchanges. Several immediate catalysts contributed to this bullish momentum. Firstly, recent regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has reduced market uncertainty. Secondly, continued adoption by traditional finance (TradFi) firms for treasury reserves has provided a steady demand baseline. Finally, macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns in several economies, have renewed interest in Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties. Analyzing the Drivers of the Cryptocurrency Rally This rally is not an isolated event but the result of sustained fundamental developments. The network’s underlying health metrics remain robust. For instance, the hash rate—a measure of computational security—continues to set new records, reinforcing network integrity. Simultaneously, development activity on scaling solutions like the Lightning Network has accelerated, improving transaction efficiency and utility. Market structure has also evolved significantly. The table below contrasts key metrics from the previous cycle peak to the current environment: Metric Previous Cycle (~$69k Peak) Current Environment (~$90k) Futures Open Interest Extremely High, Leveraged More Balanced, Less Speculative Spot ETF Flows Not Available Consistent Net Inflows On-Chain Holder Behavior High Exchange Inflows Increased Long-Term Holding (HODLing) Institutional Custody Growing Widespread and Mature This data suggests a more mature and structurally sound market foundation supporting current prices. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of macro-economic factors. “The breach of $90,000 is technically significant,” notes a market strategist from a major investment bank, citing on-chain data that shows a large volume of Bitcoin moved into wallets with no history of spending. “We are observing a fundamental shift where Bitcoin is increasingly treated as a strategic asset rather than a purely speculative one.” Meanwhile, blockchain data firms report that the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains near all-time highs. This metric, often called the “HODL wave,” indicates strong conviction among long-term investors. Such behavior typically reduces available sell-side pressure, a crucial factor for sustaining price advances. The Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to this point provides essential context. Each major cycle has been defined by a new wave of adoption and a re-rating of its fundamental value proposition. The 2020-2021 cycle was largely driven by institutional discovery and pandemic-era fiscal policy. The current cycle, however, seems intertwined with global monetary policy normalization and Bitcoin’s integration into legacy financial infrastructure through spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Looking forward, several key levels and factors will be watched closely: Technical Resistance: The $95,000 to $100,000 zone is viewed as the next major psychological hurdle. Macro Sensitivity: How Bitcoin correlates with traditional risk assets like tech stocks in a changing interest rate environment. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing policy frameworks in the EU, UK, and US will impact market access and stability. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements in privacy, scalability, and smart contract functionality via layers like Taproot and sidechains. Ultimately, the market’s ability to hold gains above previous all-time highs will be a critical test of this new valuation paradigm. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $90,000 represents a pivotal chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This milestone reflects a complex interplay of improved market structure, deepening institutional participation, and enduring macroeconomic narratives. While volatility remains an inherent feature, the current price discovery above previous cycle highs suggests a market maturing through successive phases of adoption. The focus for investors and observers now shifts to whether this **Bitcoin price** level can form a durable foundation for the next stage of growth in the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly caused Bitcoin to jump above $90,000? A1: The move resulted from a combination of factors: sustained inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, positive regulatory developments in several countries, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty driving demand for alternative assets. It was not a single event but a convergence of sustained bullish catalysts. Q2: How does the current market differ from when Bitcoin last hit a record high? A2: Key differences include significantly higher institutional custody, the presence of regulated spot ETFs creating constant buy-side pressure, lower leverage in derivatives markets, and a larger proportion of the supply being held long-term, indicating stronger investor conviction. Q3: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this rally? A3: Investment timing depends entirely on individual risk tolerance and goals. Financial advisors universally recommend that cryptocurrency should only constitute a small, allocated portion of a diversified portfolio, never funds needed for essentials. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Q4: What are the main risks to Bitcoin’s price at this level? A4: Primary risks include sudden, restrictive regulatory changes in a major economy, a sharp reversal in global liquidity conditions, a critical security flaw discovered in the protocol, or a prolonged downturn in traditional markets causing a “risk-off” sell-off across all asset classes. Q5: What is the significance of the $90,000 price point? A5: Beyond being a round number, breaking decisively above the previous all-time high (around $69,000) is a major technical and psychological achievement. It confirms a new bullish market cycle and shifts the entire historical price range, potentially attracting a new wave of institutional and retail interest.

Investors have begun aggressively buying the dip to start the new year, shaking off the stagnation that characterised the final weeks of December. Over the past 24 hours, the total crypto market cap regained its footing above the psychological $3 trillion mark, having rallied roughly 2% to $3.12 trillion at press time. Market sentiment showed signs of relief as well, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbing 8 points to 36. While this still sits in “Fear” territory, it marks a significant move out of the Extreme Fear doldrums that persisted throughout the holiday season. Altcoins were the biggest beneficiaries of this liquidity injection, with meme coins stealing the show throughout the day. Led by Pepe Coin (PEPE), which saw double-digit gains, the sector outperformed the broader market. Other major meme assets, including Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), were also trading firmly in the green at the time of publication, fueled by a renewed appetite for high-beta plays. Why is Bitcoin price and crypto market up today? Bitcoin and the overall crypto market’s rally today has been driven by a combination of seasonal trends and a resurgence in global risk appetite. One of the clearest factors at play is the “January Effect,” as investors who closed out loss-heavy positions in December for tax purposes are now redeploying capital into the market. This new-year reset has historically sparked inflows, but it’s been especially pronounced this time given the steep end-of-year selloffs. Bitcoin price, for instance, had pulled back nearly 30% from its October peak of $126,000, and many viewed the $85,000 to $87,000 zone as a compelling long-term support range. Today’s move suggests those dip-buying efforts are now materializing with more conviction, aided by whale activity. On-chain data over the past two days has shown a notable uptick in large-holder accumulation, adding weight behind the bounce. At the same time, open interest in futures has risen more than 2%, topping $130 billion, which is a clear nod that leveraged traders are entering the market with bullish bets. This kind of futures-led growth alongside spot price movement tends to confirm underlying momentum. Beyond the crypto-native catalysts, global risk appetite has also returned. Equity futures for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have pointed to a positive 2026 open, as traders begin to price in the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts by March. The ongoing wave of IPOs and improving macro outlook have pulled traditional investors back into high-growth sectors, and crypto often sits high on that list when risk sentiment turns favorable. There’s also a structural tailwind from regulatory clarity that began to take shape late last year. With the GENIUS Act setting clearer guidelines for digital assets and stablecoin frameworks becoming more predictable, institutional participants have more confidence navigating the space. This is already playing out in spot ETF flows, where selling pressure in both Bitcoin and Ethereum has begun to subside. Even meme coins have helped drive sentiment, as traders rotate into riskier assets in search of higher short-term upside. The rally across tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB has added to the sense that capital is flowing more freely again. What’s next for Bitcoin price? For Bitcoin bulls, reclaiming the psychological support level at $90,000 would be a strong validation point that could open the door to further upside. Since mid-December, this zone has acted as a key ceiling, with each rally attempt falling short of a clean break. A decisive push above it could reset the narrative and give traders confidence to begin positioning for a potential return to six-figure territory in the months ahead. Per the 24-hour liquidation heatmap, Bitcoin’s latest rally has clearly forced a large wave of short liquidations, particularly clustered near the $88,000 to $90,000 range. See below: Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The visual density in these upper bands, coupled with real-time data showing $271.65 million in total liquidations, of which $217.82 million were shorts, points to how this move has caught bearish traders off guard. Ethereum bore the brunt with $29.73 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $23.97 million, highlighting the scale of pain for leveraged shorts across majors. At the same time, the BTC liquidation heatmap suggests that if the price can close and hold above $90,000, there is a thin layer of resistance in the immediate range, with fewer liquidation clusters between $91,000 and $94,000. This opens a clean short-term path for bulls to test higher territory, particularly if spot bids continue to rise and ETF inflows stabilise. On the downside, the chart shows a heavy liquidation build-up just below $88,000, followed by more intense bands near $86,000 and $84,500. This area is also where a new CME futures gap has emerged between roughly $87,800 and $88,000, a zone many traders are now watching closely as a potential downside magnet. CME gaps have a long track record of attracting price action, and with the rally unfolding into the weekend, some expect Bitcoin to drift back toward this region before attempting any sustained move higher next week. Market participants have already flagged this risk, noting that weekend trading conditions often produce choppier price action and additional gaps that can complicate early-week structure. “Good one to keep an eye on in the week ahead,” trading account Daan Crypto Trades wrote on X, adding that with the market heading into the weekend, traders could see a few gaps and a messier chart to start the year. If Bitcoin does revisit the $88,000 area, the dense liquidation clusters below could provide short-term support as shorts are forced to cover and dip buyers step in once again. A deeper pullback toward $86,000 or even $84,500 would likely test broader market conviction, but those zones also align with strong liquidation liquidity that could help cushion downside moves. For now, the near-term outlook hinges on whether bulls can maintain pressure above $90,000. At press time, Bitcoin price was trading at $89,598, holding on to gains of roughly 2% on the day. Top altcoin gainers for the day The altcoin market cap rose 3% to nearly $1.36 trillion earlier in the day before settling at $1.34 trillion at press time. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market cap, rose 3.3% over the day, recovering back above $3,000, and was perched at $3,075 when writing. Other large-cap altcoins such as BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) saw similar gains between 2-3% respectively. Nearly all of the top 100 altcoins in terms of market capitalization were in the green. Sector-wise, the meme coin market saw some of the leading gainers of the day as the total tally of all combined went up 12% over the past 24 hours. Among them were Pepe (PEPE), outpacing the rest with gains of 32%, largely boosted by improved community sentiment after a well-followed trader who previously predicted the memecoin move to billions when it was trading at $600k, made a fresh prediction that it would go up by as much as $69 billion by the end of this year. As Pepe rallied, momentum quickly spilled over into other speculative assets, which are often backed by large cult-like followings that tend to eat into the hype. Floki (FLOKI) and SPX6900 (SPX) caught the slipstream of Pepe’s rally to post gains of over 17%, respectively. Other leading memecoins were also hovering in the green at press time.

The Yearly Dogecoin Chart On the yearly view, Cantonese Cat’s chart frames 2025 as a hold of the 0.786 log Fibonacci support at roughly $0.10879, with the market printing an inside candle into year-end. In that construction, the key takeaway is not momentum but structure: price respected a major retracement line on a log scale and stayed boxed inside the prior year’s range: “DOGE ended 2025 holding 0.786 log fib as support, forming an inside candle, favors bullish continuation,” the analyst writes. The same yearly chart also contextualizes what “continuation” on the yearly view means: the next major reference level is the 1.0 fib line up near $0.73905. That is not being presented as an imminent target, but it does underscore why analysts care about this zone, if the 0.786 level holds on higher timeframes, the chart’s mapped upside is structurally open, even if the path is not linear. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mirrors AMD’s Setup From Last Year, Analyst Claims The Monthly DOGE Chart Matt Hughes aka “The Great Mattsby’s” monthly chart tightens the focus to a single, precise level: the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.11778. Price is shown holding that line while carving out what the chart labels as a higher low, and the analyst is explicit about what that would mean in market-structure terms. “To me, this looks like the higher low needed to start the bottoming process, especially with price holding the 0.382 Fib retracement at 0.11778,” Mattsby wrote, adding that he views the “.11–.12 zone” as compelling on a risk/reward basis. In this framing, the thesis is conditional: the market is not “bullish” because it bounced, it’s constructive because it is attempting to stop making lower lows while defending a defined retracement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario If that $0.11778 level gives way on a monthly basis, the same fib ladder shown on the chart highlights lower references beneath it, including the 0.236 retracement around $0.08433. On the upside, the next retracement markers visible are $0.15428 (0.5) and $0.20210 (0.618), which would be the nearby “prove it” areas if this is, in fact, a basing process rather than a dead-cat bounce. The Weekly Dogecoin Chart Kevin (Kev_Capital_TA) shifts the emphasis to the weekly. Via X, he posted: “Still early but Dogecoin is currently printing a really nice weekly reversal demand candle within a major demand zone.” His conditions are tight and time-bound: “If you can confirm that weekly candle by Sunday close, reclaim the 4HR 200 sma/ema on both Doge and BTC then you could see the low put in for this major correctional phase and the counter trend move higher occuring. All eyes on 88K-91K on BTC.” For Dogecoin traders, the immediate calls are straightforward: Dogecoin needs to keep defending the $0.11–$0.12 area, while the weekly close either validates or negates Kevin’s reversal-candle thesis. If price loses the $0.11778 monthly retracement, the “bottoming” narrative weakens quickly; if it holds and begins reclaiming nearby resistance levels, the charts collectively argue the market may be transitioning from correction to base-building, one confirmed close at a time. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13242.

This is the worst performance for ETH since the 2018 bear market. The past year saw ETH close nine months in the red, its worst losing streak since 2018. Despite the overall positive performance of the Ethereum network, the underlying token lagged, only briefly making a new all-time high. In 2025, ETH did not suffer a big crisis, yet its performance was worse in comparison to 2022, when only seven months ended in the red. ETH crashed despite the lack of a major catastrophic event or bankruptcy in the crypto space, and in the midst of record wallet activity. While the Ethereum ecosystem showed signs of health, including address activity, stablecoin inflows , and DeFi expansion, the ETH token failed to fulfill expectations for a higher price range. ETH lagged in dollar terms despite a climb against BTC In 2025, ETH lost the faith of retail investors and instead became a playground for whales and institutions. ETH whales attempted to achieve a more favorable average price by buying the dip, but the token did not have enough momentum to break out. ETH failed to fulfill the prediction of Bitmine’s Tom Lee for a hike to $7,500 or even $10,000 at the end of the year. The token ended the year with 11.9% in market cap dominance. Over the course of 2025, ETH managed to recover from lows of 0.019 BTC to end the year at 0.034 BTC. Despite this, the token did not fulfill the expectations of expanding to $10,000. The weak ETH performance also coincided with the failure to launch a more lasting altcoin season. The weakness of L2 performance also affected Ethereum, as liquidity left even top networks like Arbitrum. Treasury companies only had a brief effect on the price of ETH. Unlike BTC treasuries, building up ETH reserves was viewed as a means to earn passive income through staking. Even DAT companies did not show conviction in the climb of ETH, but instead on the token’s DeFi and staking ecosystem. ETH recovered the $3,000 range Despite the downturn, ETH managed to recover the $3,000 range. The token mostly traded above the acquisition price of whales at $2,800, bouncing from this support level. The asset ended 2025 with a net loss of 11% after turbulent shifts each quarter. ETH ended 2025 with a net loss of close to 11%, despite the mid-year relief rally. Even with DeFi recovery, ETH had its worst year since 2018. | Source: Coingecko The token had its worst quarterly performance at the start of 2025, losing over 45%. Later, ETH managed to bounce off the mid-year slump and spend several weeks above $4,000. ETH moved to $3,079.92 as of January 2, following a market-wide recovery. The token ended 2025 with a neutral market sentiment, following weeks of relatively subdued derivative trading. Following the October 11 liquidation, ETH open interest declined to a low of $16.2B, recovering to $18B by the end of 2025. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Their cooperation with U.S. authorities on other crypto prosecutions reduced their potential prison time from what could have been decades behind bars for orchestrating one of the largest crypto heists in history. In a video posted to X following the conclusion of their case, Morgan said: “It’s over, and I’m very excited that I will soon be telling my story, sharing my thoughts, and telling you more about the creative and other endeavors I’ve been working on.” My statement #razzlekhan pic.twitter.com/janr9RD1Q2 — Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan (@HeatherReyhan) November 18, 2024 Trump’s Crypto Clemency Wave Draws Political Fire Lichtenstein’s release comes during a broader pattern of leniency toward crypto offenders under Trump’s administration. In March 2025, Trump pardoned BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed, and employee Greg Dwyer, all of whom pleaded guilty in 2022 to Bank Secrecy Act violations for failing to implement anti-money-laundering controls at their crypto derivatives exchange. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao received a presidential pardon in October after pleading guilty to similar violations for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at his exchange, the world’s biggest crypto platform. Trump has also expressed willingness to consider pardoning Keonne Rodriguez, CEO of privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Samourai, who was sentenced to five years for money laundering in December. During an Oval Office event on December 16, Trump told reporters: “I’ve heard about it, I’ll look at it. It sounds like, based on your question, Rodriguez. We’ll look at that, Pam,” addressing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present during the session. California Governor Gavin Newsom has intensified criticism of Trump’s pardon strategy, launching a state-backed website in December tracking what his office calls Trump’s “top criminal cronies.” California Governor Newsom slams Trump’s crypto pardons, calling @binance 's CZ and Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht “criminal cronies” in a new state tracker highlighting controversial pardons. #GavinNewsom #TrumpPardons https://t.co/j9Sac1g4Th — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 The site references Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road’s founder, sentenced to life for narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy involving over $214 million in illegal Bitcoin-facilitated drug sales, alongside newly released crime data showing continued declines across California’s major cities. This series of pardons and appeals has triggered significant political backlash, framing crypto clemency as part of a wider debate over corruption, public safety, and the expanding role of digital assets in American politics.

56738010,651787,1767375008,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Turns Negative, But History Says This Phase Could Be Significant",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharpe-ratio-turns-negative/,bitcoinist,"With Bitcoin ‘s waning price action extending and its value still below the $90,000 mark, many key metrics and indicators are starting to enter into negative territory in this new year. One of the major metrics that has turned negative as the year begins is the BTC Sharpe Ratio, which measures the risk level of the flagship cryptocurrency asset. A Rare Bitcoin Risk-Low Opportunity Has Emerged Ongoing volatility has hampered Bitcoin’s price action despite several attempts at an upward move, keeping the asset stuck below the $100,000 mark. Although the Bitcoin market appears vulnerable at first glance, a closer examination of risk-adjusted returns reveals a more complex picture. Darkfost, a market expert and author at CryptoQuant, has delved into BTC’s risk performance via the Sharpe Ratio, revealing a major shift in the market. According to Darkfost, it is a tool for evaluating risk based on the volatility and returns of an asset. By comparing these two variables, analysts are able to determine periods when exposure is more or less risky. Following his analysis of the Sharpe Ratio, the expert has disclosed that the metric has flipped into a negative territory after falling to -0.5, a move that typically unfolds during periods of market stress or transition. As seen in the chart shared by Darkfost, the metric is now approaching a historical low-risk zone. Typically, when the Sharpe ratio falls to low levels, it is accompanied by high-risk periods. However, this implies that returns have been low for Bitcoin, which is volatile by nature. In other words, investors have experienced a series of losses while volatility stays elevated. This shift may be a sign of weakness in Bitcoin market dynamics. However, it brings Bitcoin closer to areas that have historically been associated with lower downside risk and longer-term opportunities. Darkfost highlighted that the best opportunities on Bitcoin typically appear after losses have already been realized and the correction has been intensified by volatility. The trend leads to significant drawdowns and negative returns. For this reason, a negative Sharpe ratio, such as the current drop to -0.5, may indicate a favorable Bitcoin opportunity. In the past, the best purchasing opportunities have appeared whenever this ratio has reached the extremely low-risk zone indicated on the chart. Are Long-Term Holders Now Buying More BTC? A report from Axel Adler Jr., a researcher and author, shows that Bitcoin long-term holders are demonstrating resilience despite current price fluctuations. Adler’s analysis focuses on the BTC LTH Distribution Pressure metric, which has undergone a key shift that could shape the market’s trajectory. Data tells that the LTH Distribution Pressure Index has fallen to -1.628, which implies that the metric has transitioned into the Accumulation zone. The shift points to minimal selling pressure from BTC’s long-term holders, indicating renewed confidence among the cohort in the asset’s prospects. Currently, the average daily LTH spending for Bitcoin is at 221 BTC, marking one of the lowest levels in months. Darkfost also indicated the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is positioned at 1.13, confirming that BTC holders remain in profit levels. With the key metrics positioned at these critical levels, the market structure seems favorable.",Bitcoin News|Axel Adler Jr|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|LTH Distribution Pressure Index|sopr|Spent Output Profit Ratio,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

While both Bitcoin and Dogecoin remain established assets, the attention is largely centered around the accomplishment of a new player called Mutuum Finance . This initiative has recently seen its V1 lending and borrowing protocol thoroughly examined by Halborn Security. The feedback from the examination has also been incorporated, and the smart contracts have been perfected. As investors take a look at the cryptocurrencies to purchase now in light of genuine readiness and not hype, Mutuum Finance, at the current presale stage of 7, seems to slowly emerge as the best crypto. Bitcoin Remains Stable But Has Limited Potential Bitcoin is currently priced around $88,410 as it ends the year 2025 down 5% and has seen limited price action as trading volume has reduced and sellers continue to unload the asset even at a loss. The realized loss for Bitcoin currently stands at $300 million per day. Though it retains the dominant market, the immediate profit potential for Bitcoin appears to be limited. Thus, for instance, if one chooses to purchase a $5,000 Bitcoin today, it may have to perform a strong breakout to gain only a few hundred dollars. It is for this reason that investors are presently looking to other options when it comes to what to purchase for the next cycle. Dogecoin Remains Pinned By Hype Dogecoin remains very much dependent on market sentiment and trends. Although Dogecoin does make rapid movements during a bullish phase, the cryptocurrency does not have much use value and revenue-generating factors. A Dogecoin investment of $1,500 would require a significant lift in price in order for this cryptocurrency to even double in value, which has traditionally happened when viral hype catches up with a particular cryptocurrency, and not because of its fundamental factors. Mutuum Finance Audit Changes The Narrative The main reason for the rapid popularity of Mutuum Finance lies in the fact that the security review has been completed. Halborn Security has conducted a full audit of the V1 protocol, including the lending and borrowing contracts. The audit has been completed, and the recommendations have been implemented. The team is now working on the timing of the V1 launch, and Mutuum has entered the execution phase. This is an important step for those investors searching for the best cryptocurrency to buy today. Presale Growth And Pricing Mutuum Finance has managed to raise $19,550,000 since the presale began and currently has 18,650 holders. It is currently in Phase 7 at $0.04, which is up 300% from the initial phase price of $0.01. Phase 7 is selling out quickly, and this is the last opportunity to get in at $0.04. An example of the value of getting in early is shown in this scenario. Purchasing $250 worth of tokens at $0.04 will get 6,250 tokens. If demand goes up after the launch, and MUTM hits $0.20, it will be worth $1,250. However, waiting until launch at $0.06 will only buy 4166 tokens and deliver a tiny $583 profit when MUTM touches $0.20 Mutuum Finance is creating a DeFi platform that will allow users to borrow or lend their assets with much ease. The platform will have continuous activity rather than being known for one-time hype. The project has developed a dashboard that displays the top 50 wallets and a 24-hour leaderboard that shows the biggest daily buyers. The top-ranked investor every day will receive a $500 bonus in MUTM every day, as long as there is a transaction before 00:00 UTC, when the cycle resets. As the year 2026 draws near, investors are torn between safety and upside. Bitcoin and Dogecoin provide familiarity but little upside. Mutuum Finance comes with a low barrier to entry, a totally audited V1 protocol, and adequate preparation for the launch. For those individuals wondering which cryptocurrency to invest in before the next rally, Mutuum Finance appears to be a key player among the new players.

(NASDAQ: BMNR) today announced the release of a new Chairman’s message ( link ) outlining why shareholders are being asked to vote YES on a proposal to increase the Company’s authorized shares. The message is now available on the Bitmine website and is intended to provide additional context ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. The voting deadline is January 14, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET. In the video, Chairman Tom Lee explains the rationale behind Proposal 2, which seeks shareholder approval to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. There are three reasons the Company needs to increase authorized shares: It would allow Bitmine to conduct capital markets activities, including at-the-market offerings, convertibles, and warrants. It would provide flexibility to pursue opportunistic deals, including potential mergers or acquisitions. Most importantly, it would enable the Company to implement future stock splits as needed. Since pivoting in July to make Ethereum (ETH) its primary treasury asset, Bitmine has observed that its share price has closely tracked movements in ETH. *Coefficient (per Bloomberg) is 0.015 ETH price plus accretion of ETH/share The scatter chart in the gallery above shows the clear linkage (x-axis is ETH, y-axis is BMNR). The Company believes Ethereum represents the future of finance, a supercycle driven by Wall Street reengineering on the blockchain. Major industry leaders agree, including Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who said that tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum. Previously, Bitmine noted its view that tokenization will drive ETH/BTC to reach all-time highs (0.0873). Targeting 0.25 as Ethereum proves to be the future of finance This implies future ETH prices of: $12k $22k (prior high) $62k (0.25, “payment rails”) $250k (if BTC reaches $1mm) These potential future ETH prices can be used to calculate “implied” future BMNR prices** $22k ETH → $500 BMNR $62.5k ETH → $1,500 BMNR $250k ETH → $5,000 BMNR **These are using the coefficient 0.15* ETH plus assumed accretion ETH/share of 33%. These are for illustrative purposes only. Not a forecast. To keep shares “accessible” to the public, the Company would want to split the shares, to reset the share price back towards $25. If BMNR shares are: $500, needs 20:1 split $1,500, needs 60:1 $5,000 needs 100:1 These splits will increase total shares outstanding. Thus, Bitmine can only split shares in the future if the total authorized shares is increased.

The reversal reflects the end of end-of-year tax-loss harvesting that drove Bitcoin down 23% in Q4. Buying volume accelerated at 09:30 ET, contrasting sharply with the “4 p.m. sell-off” pattern observed throughout December. CoinGlass data show futures open interest jumped 2.16% to $130 billion in the last 24 hours, indicating renewed leverage appetite. The Floor & The Flows MicroStrategy (MSTR) likely established the local floor. The firm disclosed on Dec. 29 that it had purchased 1,229 BTC at an average price of $88,568 , defending the range ahead of the New Year.

Hut 8 outperformed the spot market, rallying nearly 15% to $50.73. “The crypto market opens 2026 on a balanced note, driven by renewed institutional interest, clearer regulations, faster ETF approvals by the SEC, and the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin framework, which have boosted confidence, even as most inflows remain concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, noted in an article from The Economic Times . That dynamic flipped on Friday as U.S. spot ETFs and proxies, such as Coinbase (+3%), caught a bid. Market Outlook Despite the rally, prediction markets remain cautious. Polymarket bettors currently assign only 26% odds to Bitcoin exceeding $150,000 in 2026, favoring a consolidation year. Immediate resistance sits at the Q4 2025 breakdown level of $92,500. The headline isn’t the price; it’s the timing . Throughout Q4 2025, U.S. liquidity was the exit liquidity—consistent selling during NY hours to harvest losses. Friday’s price action confirms that the “tax drag” is gone. Desks should monitor the ETH/BTC ratio ($0.034); if U.S. institutions are truly risk-on, expect rotation into high-beta alts and miner equity to outpace spot BTC in the short term.

According to market data that tracks the TOTAL3/BTC ratio — which measures all altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum against Bitcoin — the ratio finished lower for calendar years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. That streak has left traders and fund managers rethinking the old pattern where smaller tokens would often surge after Bitcoin rallies. Related Reading: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash Altcoins Underperform Bitcoin Market watchers say Bitcoin’s share of the overall crypto market has grown. Bitcoin dominance was reported at roughly 59–60% during the late 2025 selloff, a level that squeezed room for other tokens. Based on reports, small-cap tokens hit their lowest point in four years as money flowed into larger, more liquid assets. Bitcoin itself slipped from an October peak and ended the year in negative territory, a development covered by major outlets that noted it was the first yearly loss for Bitcoin since 2022. Altcoins have now dropped against Bitcoin for 4 years in a row pic.twitter.com/K3rJhSh1tM — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) January 1, 2026 Widespread Losses And Heavy Market Moves Several data providers found the median performance among the top 30 altcoins was negative for the year. Market value across the crypto sector fell sharply in late 2025, with some estimates saying more than $1 trillion was erased from total market capitalization during the downturn. Traders described 2025 as a year that began with optimism but closed with broad losses, and many small tokens that rose earlier in the year gave those gains back when risk appetite faded. What Analysts Are Saying Some analysts argue that institutional flows and investor preference for liquidity were important drivers of this trend. Others point to macro pressures in the US and global markets that reduced appetite for speculative positions. Reports note that for an altcoin rebound to beat Bitcoin again, fresh capital would need to rotate specifically into smaller tokens, rather than simply following Bitcoin’s moves. That shift has not been evident so far as 2026 unfurls. The TOTAL3/BTC measure is being used by many traders to gauge altcoin strength versus Bitcoin. When that ratio falls year after year, it means a unit of Bitcoin buys more altcoin market cap than before. Market trackers used by exchanges and analytics firms flagged the persistent downward trend across the last four calendar years, which is an unusual run relative to prior cycles when altcoins sometimes outpaced Bitcoin for parts of a market cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Cautious Stance Investors are staying cautious. Volatility remains high and liquidity can dry up fast in smaller tokens, which makes large moves possible both ways. Based on reports, any meaningful restoration of altcoin gains will likely require clear, sustained capital flows and improved market sentiment. Until that happens, Bitcoin’s share of market capital will probably remain elevated, keeping pressure on smaller tokens.

The directive, delivered on Friday, gives the social media giant just 72 hours to submit an action-taken report and implement safeguards, directly threatening X’s legal immunity under Indian law and setting a precedent for AI regulation in one of the world’s largest digital markets. India’s Grok AI Order: The Compliance Ultimatum The Indian government’s order specifically targets Grok’s ability to generate content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. According to documents reviewed by Bitcoin World, the ministry has mandated that X restrict such content generation capabilities immediately. Furthermore, the platform must detail steps taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” This directive follows a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi, who highlighted instances where users prompted Grok to alter images of women to make them appear to be wearing bikinis. Concurrently, separate reports have flagged more disturbing instances where the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors. X acknowledged these lapses in safeguards earlier on Friday, stating that the problematic images had been taken down. However, investigations by Bitcoin World revealed that AI-altered images of women in bikinis remained accessible on the platform at the time of publication. The ministry’s warning carries significant weight: failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections under Section 79 of India’s Information Technology Act, which provides legal immunity from liability for user-generated content. Broader Regulatory Context and Legal Implications This specific order against X and Grok arrives just days after India’s IT ministry issued a broader advisory to all social media platforms on Monday. That advisory reminded companies that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content remains a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity. The government explicitly warned that “non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice.” Expert Analysis: The Safe Harbor Precedent Legal experts specializing in technology law note that India’s action represents a critical test case for global AI governance. “The conditional nature of safe harbor protections is being tested here,” explains Dr. Ananya Sharma, a professor of cyber law at the National Law University. “Platforms traditionally received immunity because they were intermediaries, not publishers. However, when a platform provides a tool like Grok that actively generates content, the lines blur significantly. Governments worldwide are watching how India navigates this new terrain.” Sharma further notes that any tightening of enforcement in India could create ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions, potentially forcing them to adopt the strictest regulatory standards globally. The table below outlines the key components of India’s compliance order to X: Requirement Deadline Potential Consequence Implement technical changes to restrict obscene content generation Immediate Loss of safe harbor protection Submit detailed action-taken report 72 hours from order Legal action under IT Act and criminal statutes Strengthen internal safeguards and moderation Ongoing compliance Fines and potential platform blocking The Political and Market Dynamics at Play India, with its nearly 900 million internet users, has emerged as a crucial battleground for technology regulation. The government’s assertive stance comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court. The platform argues that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even while complying with a majority of blocking directives. This creates a complex backdrop where X simultaneously contests broader regulations while facing specific, urgent demands regarding its AI product. Simultaneously, Grok’s integration into X has increased its visibility and political sensitivity. Unlike standalone AI tools, Grok is increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs part of the platform’s public discourse. This integration means that any flaws in Grok’s content filters have immediate and widespread public impact. The platform’s response to this order will be closely monitored, not just by Indian regulators, but by governments worldwide grappling with similar AI content challenges. Global Implications for AI Governance India’s action represents a significant development in the global struggle to regulate generative AI. Several key factors make this case particularly noteworthy: Market Scale: As one of the world’s largest digital markets, India’s regulatory decisions influence global corporate policies. Legal Framework Test: This case tests the applicability of existing intermediary liability laws to AI-generated content. Technical Enforcement: The order demands “technical changes,” pushing platforms toward proactive content filtering at the generation stage. Cross-Jurisdictional Impact: Compliance measures implemented for India may become de facto global standards for companies. Conclusion India’s critical Grok AI order to Elon Musk’s X platform represents a watershed moment in the regulation of generative artificial intelligence. By directly linking AI content generation to safe harbor protections, the Indian government has established a clear precedent: platforms that provide content-creation tools bear responsibility for their outputs. The 72-hour compliance deadline underscores the urgency with which regulators view these issues, particularly concerning sexually explicit and potentially unlawful material. As X navigates this compliance challenge while simultaneously contesting broader regulations in court, the outcome will undoubtedly shape not only the future of Grok in India but also the global conversation about platform liability, AI governance, and the boundaries of digital free expression in the age of generative artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What exactly did India order X to do regarding Grok? The Indian IT Ministry ordered X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to restrict Grok’s ability to generate obscene, sexually explicit, or unlawful content. The platform has 72 hours to submit a report detailing the steps taken. Q2: What are the “safe harbor” protections mentioned in the order? Under Section 79 of India’s IT Act, intermediaries (like social media platforms) enjoy legal immunity from liability for user-generated content, provided they comply with certain due diligence requirements. The order warns that non-compliance could cause X to lose this protection. Q3: What specific content triggered this government action? The action was prompted by user reports and a formal complaint from an MP regarding Grok generating AI-altered images of women in bikinis and, separately, instances of the chatbot creating sexualized images involving minors. Q4: How does this order fit into India’s broader tech regulation strategy? This is part of a consistent push by Indian regulators to ensure global tech platforms comply with local laws. It follows a broader advisory sent days earlier to all social media companies reminding them of their obligations regarding prohibited content. Q5: What happens if X does not comply within the 72-hour deadline? The government has warned of “strict legal consequences,” which could include action under India’s IT law and criminal statutes against the platform, its officers, and offending users. This could mean fines, prosecution, or even the potential loss of legal immunity for user content.

Together, the claims and charts framed a split market view, with supporters pointing to balance sheet backing while traders priced heavier risk around MSTR’s index status and recent drawdown. Saylor Linked STRC Dividend Pitch Draws Skepticism Adam Livingston said Strategy founder Michael Saylor now offers an “income vehicle” called STRC that pays an 11% cash dividend each month, and he framed the yield as a test of whether traditional finance is misreading the product’s risk. In a post on X, Livingston said critics have questioned whether an 11% monthly paid cash dividend can be legitimate. He also said skeptics have asked where the cash flow comes from, while, in his view, they still accept lower yields from government bonds despite persistent deficit spending. Livingston argued STRC differs from typical high yield products because, he said, it has balance sheet coverage that can support dividends for years, does not rely on refinancing windows to survive, and does not depend on consumer demand or economic growth to keep paying. He added that STRC is being valued like junk credit even though he claims its structure and backing do not match that profile. He also said the debate reflects a larger mismatch in how markets define safety, contrasting STRC with governments running structural deficits, companies that repeatedly roll debt, and pensions dependent on optimistic return assumptions. Saylor Links Bitcoin to MSTR’s Outsize Derivatives Bet Meanwhile, Michael Saylor said “Bitcoin makes $MSTR interesting” in a short post on X, tying Strategy’s stock story to its Bitcoin exposure rather than its legacy software business. MSTR Open Interest vs Market Cap. Source: Strategy / X A graphic shared alongside the message compared “Open Interest / Mkt Cap” across large U.S. stocks and showed MSTR far ahead of peers. The chart put MSTR at 86.2%, while Tesla followed at 22% and Meta at 10.4%. Nvidia registered 7.2% on the same measure, while Alphabet stood at 4.1% and Amazon at 4%. Apple and Microsoft appeared lowest in the group, at 3.4% and 3%, respectively. Polymarket Prices Higher Odds of MSTR MSCI Removal A market tracked by Polymarket showed a sharp rise in the perceived risk that Strategy’s stock, MSTR, could be removed from the MSCI index by March 31. As of the latest reading, the contract implied a 76% probability, up about 40 percentage points from earlier levels. The probability line climbed quickly in early December and then fluctuated between the mid-60% and mid-70% range before settling near 76% late in the month. The chart reflects shifting expectations among traders rather than an official decision by MSCI. The surge in delisting odds has coincided with a steep decline in MSTR’s share price. According to data cited alongside the chart, the stock has fallen about 66% over the past six months, dropping from roughly $457 to around $152.",News|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Price action remains choppy, reflecting a market that has yet to commit to a clear trend. After sharp swings earlier in the quarter, Bitcoin now sits in a compressed range, drawing attention to on-chain data for clues. Traders appear cautious as 2026 begins. Source: CoinCodex Is the market preparing for resolution, or is patience still required? Exchange Netflows Signal Measured Risk Bitcoin’s exchange netflow data shows persistent outflows across most sessions, indicating that more BTC continues to leave exchanges than enter them. This pattern often reflects reduced immediate selling pressure. However, the magnitude of outflows has moderated compared with earlier rally phases. Source: Cryptoquant Large spikes remain sporadic, suggesting selective positioning rather than broad accumulation. Price has responded with sideways movement rather than expansion and the signal aligns with a high-volatility range environment instead of a breakout phase. Coinbase Premium Shows Cooling U.S. Demand The Coinbase Premium Index has remained mostly negative in recent weeks, highlighting softer spot demand from U.S based investors. Periods of positive premium earlier in the year coincided with stronger price advances, yet that momentum has faded. Source: Cryptoquant The sustained discount suggests buyers hesitate to chase higher prices. While not signaling panic, the data points to restrained conviction. Without consistent premium support, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim higher resistance levels. SOPR Reflects Fragile Profit-Taking The Spent Output Profit Ratio currently hovers slightly below 1.0, indicating that coins move on-chain at breakeven levels. This reading suggests holders neither rush to realize large profits nor capitulate at losses. During strong bull phases, SOPR often sustains levels well above 1.0. That condition has not emerged. Instead, price reactions remain sensitive to small shifts in sentiment. On the side note, this behavior supports the view of a market waiting for confirmation. Scenarios Shape the 2026 Outlook Analysts outline three scenarios for Bitcoin in 2026. The highest-probability path remains a twisted range . Rate-cut expectations persist, yet economic recovery lacks strength. ETF flows appear intermittent and short-term in nature. Under this setup, Bitcoin could oscillate between $80K and $140K, with $90K to $120K forming the core zone. Concerns around Federal Reserve independence under President Donald Trump have added uncertainty to the dollar outlook. Goldman Sachs strategists have noted a dovish skew to rate forecasts as leadership changes approach at the Fed. A medium-probability scenario involves a macro shock. If recession risks intensify, deleveraging and ETF outflows could push Bitcoin below $80,000, with downside extending toward $50,000 . The lowest-probability scenario reflects a risk-on revival. Early easing, stabilized ETF inflows, and supportive liquidity could open a path toward $120,000 to $170,000. Such an outcome would require multiple favorable conditions aligning. Eyes Turn to Next Week’s Data Attention now shifts to upcoming U.S. economic data, including Nonfarm Payrolls and the unemployment rate. These releases may influence near-term dollar direction and rate expectations . Strong labor data could limit dollar weakness and cap Bitcoin’s upside. Weaker figures could reignite easing bets and volatility.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Analysts present a detailed examination of market forces that could shape digital asset performance throughout the coming year, combining institutional data with macroeconomic analysis. Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: ETF Inflows and Dominance Projections The Block Research analysts project Bitcoin will maintain market dominance exceeding 50% throughout 2025. This forecast relies heavily on continued net inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have fundamentally altered institutional participation since their 2024 approval. According to historical data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated approximately $50 billion in assets under management during their first year of operation. Market timing remains a crucial consideration for investors. Some analysts anticipate sideways price movement during the first half of 2025, followed by a bullish reversal in the second half. This pattern mirrors historical Bitcoin cycles where consolidation periods precede significant upward movements. However, geopolitical tensions and regulatory developments could potentially limit new all-time highs despite favorable structural conditions. Institutional Perspectives on Bitcoin Performance Financial institutions have developed increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin valuation models. The stock-to-flow model, while controversial, continues to influence market expectations. More traditional analysts examine Bitcoin through multiple lenses including: Macroeconomic correlations with inflation data and currency devaluation Network fundamentals including hash rate and active address metrics Regulatory developments across major economies and trading jurisdictions Technological advancements in layer-2 solutions and smart contract capabilities Historical data from CoinMetrics indicates Bitcoin’s 60-day correlation with traditional risk assets has decreased from 0.7 in 2022 to approximately 0.3 in late 2024. This decoupling suggests Bitcoin may be developing more independent price discovery mechanisms as institutional adoption matures. Stablecoin Sector Expansion Toward $500 Billion Threshold The stablecoin market demonstrates remarkable growth potential according to The Block Research analysis. Total stablecoin supply could surpass $500 billion during 2025, representing a substantial increase from the approximately $160 billion circulating at the end of 2024. This expansion correlates directly with several key adoption drivers. Corporate payment integration represents the most significant growth vector. Major payment processors including PayPal and Stripe have expanded stablecoin support throughout 2024. Cross-border settlement efficiency provides compelling cost savings compared to traditional correspondent banking networks. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) reported in late 2024 that blockchain-based settlements reduced average transaction times from 3-5 days to under 24 hours. Stablecoin Market Share Projections 2025 Stablecoin 2024 Market Share 2025 Projected Share Primary Use Case USDT (Tether) 68% 55-60% Exchange trading pairs USDC (Circle) 22% 30-35% Corporate payments & bridging DAI (MakerDAO) 5% 7-9% DeFi collateral Other Stablecoins 5% 4-6% Niche applications Market share redistribution represents another critical trend. USDT’s dominance may decline as USDC emerges as a preferred neutral bridging asset. Regulatory clarity from the United States Treasury Department regarding stablecoin issuance has accelerated institutional adoption of compliant alternatives. European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, fully implemented in December 2024, establish additional compliance requirements favoring transparent stablecoin operators. Prediction Markets Emerge as Dominant Narrative Prediction markets represent one of 2025’s strongest cryptocurrency narratives according to The Block Research. These decentralized platforms enable users to speculate on real-world events using blockchain-based contracts. Growth drivers include increasing geopolitical uncertainty, election cycles in major economies, and technological maturation of oracle networks. Platforms like Polymarket and Augur have demonstrated substantial volume growth throughout 2024. The U.S. presidential election generated over $200 million in prediction market volume across decentralized platforms. This represents a 400% increase compared to the 2020 election cycle according to Dune Analytics data. Market structure improvements including lower fees and enhanced liquidity mechanisms should accelerate adoption throughout 2025. Complementary Sector Growth: Perp DEXs and RWAs Perpetual decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) continue gaining market share against centralized counterparts. dYdX, GMX, and Gains Network collectively processed over $500 billion in volume during 2024. These platforms offer non-custodial trading with leverage up to 100x in some cases. Regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges throughout 2024 has accelerated migration toward decentralized alternatives. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization represents another growth sector. Financial institutions including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have launched blockchain-based tokenization platforms. These enable fractional ownership of traditionally illiquid assets including real estate, private equity, and fine art. The total value of tokenized RWAs exceeded $15 billion by December 2024 according to RWA.xyz data. Market Risks and Potential Headwinds The Block Research identifies several potential headwinds that could impact 2025 cryptocurrency performance. Corporate treasury selling represents a significant concern. Companies holding substantial digital asset reserves may implement profit-taking strategies. Bitmain, the cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturer, reportedly holds approximately 50,000 ETH worth roughly $200 million at current prices. Analysts suggest the company may begin selling these holdings during the first quarter of 2025. Venture capital valuations present additional concerns. Private market cryptocurrency company valuations reached unprecedented levels during the 2021-2022 bull market. Many of these investments face dilution or down rounds as companies require additional funding. Token unlock schedules exacerbate selling pressure. Approximately $50 billion worth of previously locked tokens will become liquid throughout 2025 according to TokenUnlocks.app data. Altcoin performance may demonstrate sustained weakness according to analyst consensus. Only projects with verifiable real-world use cases and sustainable tokenomics will likely maintain valuation. The altcoin market capitalization relative to Bitcoin has declined throughout 2024, continuing a trend that began in early 2022. This suggests capital rotation toward established assets with clearer regulatory pathways. Conclusion The Block Research 2025 cryptocurrency outlook presents a nuanced perspective on market development. Bitcoin dominance appears sustainable given institutional adoption through ETF vehicles. Stablecoin expansion toward $500 billion reflects broader financial system integration. Prediction markets emerge as a dominant narrative alongside complementary sectors including perp DEXs and RWA tokenization. However, investors must remain cognizant of potential headwinds including corporate selling and token unlock schedules. The Bitcoin 2025 outlook ultimately depends on macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and technological innovation across the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason The Block Research expects Bitcoin to maintain over 50% market dominance? A1: Analysts cite continued net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as the primary driver. Institutional adoption through these regulated vehicles provides sustained buying pressure that supports Bitcoin’s market position relative to altcoins. Q2: How could stablecoin supply realistically reach $500 billion in 2025? A2: Corporate payment integration represents the largest growth vector. As more businesses adopt stablecoins for cross-border settlements and supply chain payments, demand for dollar-pegged digital assets increases substantially beyond current trading-focused usage. Q3: Why are prediction markets considered a strong narrative for 2025? A3: Prediction markets benefit from multiple catalysts including global election cycles, geopolitical uncertainty, and technological maturation. These platforms offer transparent event resolution that traditional betting markets cannot match, creating unique utility. Q4: What risks could limit Bitcoin’s potential for new all-time highs? A4: Geopolitical tensions, regulatory crackdowns in major economies, and macroeconomic factors like sustained high interest rates could suppress price appreciation. Additionally, large-scale token unlocks and corporate treasury selling create technical selling pressure. Q5: Why might USDC gain market share against USDT in 2025? A5: USDC benefits from regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions and its perception as a more compliant, transparent stablecoin. As institutional adoption increases, particularly for corporate payments, entities prefer assets with clearer regulatory standing and auditing practices.

He once called it “a feature, not a bug” while pitching Strategy as the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin holder in the public market. That pitch is about to meet its biggest test yet, as the company prepares to report a multibillion‑dollar loss for Q4 after Bitcoin saw a 24% crash. The expected hit marks a sharp reversal from the prior quarter, when Strategy booked a $2.8 billion profit. This time, the numbers move the other way. The loss is tied to an unrealized markdown on the company’s roughly $60 billion Bitcoin stash, whose value dropped fast as crypto prices fell late in the year. The swing is large, and investors are already bracing for it. Strategy’s accounting change exposes the full effect of Bitcoin’s drop Cryptopolitan previously reported that Strategy changed how it logged its crypto holdings in Q1 2024 when the company began valuing its Bitcoin at current market prices, rather than keeping it at cost. That naturally makes earnings far more sensitive to price moves, especially during sharp selloffs like the one seen in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin fell 24% over that period. That single move explains why the coming loss looks so heavy. Aaron Jacob, an associate professor at Brigham Young University and a senior adviser at Taxbit, put it plainly. “There was this one-time pop, but that is a different story in this quarter,” Jacob said. “It is going to be a sizable loss.” The timing matters. Strategy, once known as MicroStrategy, reinvented itself years ago as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy. That approach paid off for a while. The stock beat major indexes after the shift. But sentiment turned in 2025. The shares fell 48% during the year, signaling growing doubts about the treasury‑heavy model Saylor built more than five years ago. Falling equity prices also raised practical concerns. Bitcoin produces no income. The company’s software unit brings in limited positive cash flow. Investors began to question how Strategy would cover future costs like dividends and interest payments without selling Bitcoin. To ease that pressure, the company raised cash on Dec. 1 by selling common shares and building a reserve. Strategy juggles guidance, balance sheet pressure, and fading premium At the start of last month, Strategy updated its full‑year outlook using a Bitcoin price range of $85,000 to $110,000 by year‑end. Based on that range, the company projected operating income anywhere from a $7 billion loss to a $9.5 billion profit. Bitcoin finished the year down 6.5%, closing at $87,648, pushing expectations closer to the lower end of that range. Saylor’s crypto movement is no longer unique, as you should know, because in 2024, many public companies copied the Strategy playbook to attract investors seeking stock‑based crypto exposure. Some surged early, then sank as prices rolled over. Tommy Lee‑backed BitMine Immersion Technologies followed that path and now faces the same fair‑value accounting rules. Bitcoin’s crash also hit Saylor personally, as his net worth fell about 40% in 2025 to roughly $3.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Another pressure point is Strategy’s enterprise value, which includes debt and perpetual preferred stock, stood at $61 billion, which is close to the value of its Bitcoin holdings and risks slipping below it for the first time in more than two years. The stock has dropped by nearly 70% from its November 2024 peak, dragging the company’s mNAV to just above 1 and wiping out most of the premium investors once paid for Strategy exposure. But on the first trading day of 2026, Strategy stock has surged by 5.2% as of press time to around $160, while Bitcoin has rallied 2.6% to $90,549.

With market cap holding around 1.79 tn and 24-hour trading volume jumping above 44 bn, momentum is quietly rebuilding even as broader sentiment remains cautious. The world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to lead the market, accounting for a large share of the total crypto market cap of roughly 3.06 tn. Circulating supply is now just under 20 mn BTC, leaving limited room before the 21 mn hard cap—an ongoing structural factor supporting long-term valuation. Why Bitcoin Is Rising Today Bitcoin’s latest move higher isn’t driven by hype. Instead, it reflects improving market participation and steady accumulation. Trading volume has surged more than 120% day on day, a sign that buyers are stepping in with conviction rather than chasing short-term moves. At the same time, the Fear and Greed Index remains in “fear” territory near 34, suggesting positioning is still cautious. Historically, that combination—rising price with restrained sentiment—often supports sustained trends rather than blow-off rallies. Altcoin participation remains selective, with the Altcoin Season Index near 24, firmly keeping the market in Bitcoin-led mode. Bitcoin Price Price Prediction: Triangle Breakout to Drive Bullish Price Action Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC is trading near $89,900 on the 2-hour chart, and the structure looks increasingly constructive. Price has been compressing inside a symmetrical triangle, defined by lower highs from the $93,500 area and a rising base formed between $85,800 and $87,000. This pattern reflects balance and declining volatility, not weakness. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The broader trend remains intact. Bitcoin continues to post higher lows, supported by an ascending trendline from mid-December. Price is holding above the 50-EMA and 100-EMA cluster near $88,500–$89,000, where both averages have flattened and started to curl higher. This type of EMA compression often precedes directional expansion when paired with structural support. Candlestick behavior supports that view. Recent pullbacks have produced small-bodied candles with limited lower wicks, showing dips are being absorbed rather than sold. There’s no evidence of distribution patterns or aggressive bearish follow-through. RSI has pushed into the high-60s, breaking above its prior range and signaling building upside pressure without reaching stretched conditions. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Key Levels and Forward View From a projection standpoint, a confirmed close above triangle resistance near $90,500–$90,900 would likely trigger a measured move toward $93,500, followed by the $96,000 region if momentum accelerates. On the downside, the structure weakens only on sustained acceptance below 87,000, which would expose the 85,800 support zone. From a forward-looking lens, this setup resembles consolidation before continuation rather than exhaustion. Acceptance above 90,500 would favor a move toward 95,000 and beyond, reinforcing optimism around the next phase of the crypto cycle as liquidity gradually returns. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Julia Goodwin learned this twice. First, she and her husband Glenn were asleep in their Delray Beach home when tapping at the sliding glass door pulled them into the living room. They thought it was a bird. The light flipped on. The noise stopped. Then the glass exploded. All of a sudden, there were guns pressed into her head and neck while demands came fast for her phone, laptop, and wallet access. Since 2020, more than 215 physical crypto attacks have been recorded worldwide, with 2025 nearly doubling the prior year. Security tracker Jameson Lopp has said the real number is higher because many victims stay silent. According to Bloomberg, the organizer of these crimes is a dude named Jarod Seemungal, better known as Meow, who was a genius at 14, basically living online, coding for games, and getting paid in Bitcoin. But Jarod was robbed himself at gunpoint months later and decided to hire muscle. The Goodwin attack was meant to grab at least $200,000, believed to sit on Gemini. Three days later, the crew abducted a 20-year-old hacker, forced him to open empty Coinbase accounts, beat him, sent ransom videos, and then dumped him near I-95. In Texas, associates burned a man with a hot iron and jammed utensils under his mother’s fingernails. He fled while they searched the yard for a hardware wallet. In another miss, Remy broke into an empty Airbnb wearing a delivery uniform, according to Bloomberg. In July, as the goons staked out a retired New York firefighter believed to hold $200,000 across Coinbase and a Ledger device, the FBI moved. Agents arrested Remy at a turnpike McDonald’s. In his trunk sat zip ties and an AK-style rifle. Sentencing was severe, though. Remy received 47 years for kidnapping conspiracy and wire fraud. Matt, a lookout who earned only $4,000 in seven months, got 12 years. Jarod is due for release in 2040. US largest exchange limits protection as physical crypto attacks rise Meanwhile, Coinbase (the largest crypto exchange in America) says its platform insurance mainly covers server breaches, not coercion. Allegedly , in one instance, machine-learning systems flagged irregular activity and stopped the final $9,145 transfer, not the prior $156,853. Coinbase says it balances stopping bad actors with customer access. Julia still believes in crypto and blockchain, even after two attacks. Travel costs more now. Glenn’s health worsens. She told Jarod in court, “You’ve squandered everything that I worked so hard for.” Meanwhile, Russian hackers are still draining crypto wallets linked to the massive LastPass breach in 2022, according to analysis from TRM Labs. Back then, LastPass had admitted that attackers got into its systems by hacking a developer account. They stole parts of the company’s source code and technical tools. Later, the same hackers hit GoTo, the cloud provider where LastPass had stored encrypted vault backups. Those vaults held not just passwords, but in many cases, crypto wallet seed phrases and private keys. “Depending on the length and complexity of your master password and iteration count setting, you may want to reset your master password,” warned LastPass.

The unlock arrived at a sensitive moment for price action, coming just after XRP closed December 2025 in the red. Large escrow releases often lead to concerns about sell pressure , but early on-chain activity suggests the usual Ripple pattern is already unfolding, with a significant portion of the unlocked supply being prepared for relocking. How The 1 Billion XRP Escrow Release Unfolded Blockchain data shows the release occurred in three major transactions, all settled within a narrow time window on January 1. Immediately the year started, 300 million XRP, valued at about $552 million, was unlocked and sent to the address rMhkqz, identified as the Ripple (28) wallet. Shortly after, another 200 million XRP, worth about $368 million, followed into the same wallet, bringing Ripple (28)’s intake to half a billion XRP within seconds. The final and largest portion arrived into a third wallet during which 500 million XRP, valued at approximately $920 million, was released to the r9NpyV address, designated as the Ripple (9) wallet. Together, these transactions completed the scheduled 1 billion XRP escrow release, immediately increasing the circulating supply on paper. The timing of the escrow release adds complexity to XRP’s near-term outlook. XRP ended December 2025 with a red monthly close of negative 14.8%. Notably, this was the first time XRP closed December in the red since 2022. An influx of unlocked tokens during such a period can increase bearish sentiment, particularly among short-term traders sensitive to supply changes. Relocking Activity As Ripple Repeats Its Playbook History shows Ripple always relocks between 70% and 80% of each monthly escrow release, a practice that has helped soften long-term supply shocks. Interestingly, activity after the unlocks indicates this approach was repeated within 24 hours of the unlocks. Transaction records from XRPScan reveal that funds exiting the Ripple (9) wallet were quickly routed toward new escrow arrangements, and a substantial share of the newly released supply was removed from immediate circulation. Millions of tokens were sent out from both Ripple (9) and Ripple (28) simultaneously. At 17:17 UTC, an escrow creation transaction locked 500 million XRP into the Ripple (15) address, followed by another escrow creation at 17:21 UTC that secured an additional 100 million XRP in the same wallet. Related Reading: Ripple’s XRP Ledger Just Did Something Bitcoin Has Never Done Parallel activity was also observed from Ripple (14), where a separate escrow creation locked 100 million XRP at 17:19 UTC. Combined, these transactions accounted for 700 million XRP already placed back into escrow. The appearance of escrow creation transactions changes the narrative of a supply dump. Instead of a full-scale sell-off, the data points to controlled relocking consistent with Ripple’s strategy of escrow management. XRP’s price response will likely depend less on the headline escrow release itself and more on how much of the remaining unlocked supply reaches crypto exchanges.",Ripple|blockchain|escrow|ripple|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In early trading on January 2, Strategy shares rose modestly, offering brief relief after months of pressure. Even with the bounce, the stock remains down roughly 66% from its July peak. The company’s mNAV, a measure comparing its market valuation to the value of its Bitcoin holdings, stood near 1.02, leaving little margin before slipping below 1.0. A move beneath that level would mean the market is valuing Strategy at less than the Bitcoin it owns. Why Strategy’s Bitcoin Discount Is Raising Red Flags The distinction matters because Strategy’s equity appeal has long rested on trading at a premium to its Bitcoin reserves. When mNAV falls below 1.0, investors can theoretically buy Bitcoin more cheaply by purchasing the asset directly rather than holding a stock that represents it. Historically, such conditions have triggered selling pressure, as the rationale for paying corporate risk, dilution, and management costs weakens. The company’s balance sheet reflects the tension. Strategy holds 672,497 bitcoin, the largest corporate stash in the world, accumulated since August 2020 at an average cost of about $75,000 per coin. With Bitcoin trading around $90,000, those holdings are worth roughly $60.7 billion, leaving the company with an unrealized gain of about 20%. Despite that, Strategy’s basic market capitalization sits closer to $45 billion, and its diluted valuation is around $50 billion, already implying a discount to the underlying assets. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries On an enterprise value basis, which accounts for debt and cash, Strategy’s mNAV is estimated just under 1.0. That proximity has sharpened scrutiny because the company relies on issuing equity at a premium to fund further Bitcoin purchases. If the stock trades persistently below the value of its reserves, raising capital through share sales becomes more difficult and potentially dilutive. Management has taken steps to reduce near-term funding risk. In recent weeks, Strategy raised $747.8 million through stock sales under its ATM program. Billionaire Michael Saylor’s Strategy boosts USD reserves by $748M to $2.19B via its ATM program, while holding 671,268 BTC unchanged. #BTC #Bitcoin https://t.co/gOqBzbzzXy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 The company says the reserve now covers roughly 21 months of dividend and interest obligations, easing pressure to liquidate Bitcoin during periods of market stress. Executives have described selling Bitcoin as a last resort , to be considered only if other financing options close and the firm’s valuation falls below its asset base. Bitcoin Premium Shrinks as Strategy Stock Struggles Still, another threshold looms below the mNAV line. If Bitcoin were to fall under Strategy’s average acquisition price near $74,000, the company’s holdings would drop below cost, potentially testing investor confidence. While some shareholders view such scenarios as long-term buying opportunities, they can also amplify volatility among traders less committed to the strategy. The stock’s recent performance reflects that uncertainty, with Strategy shares having fallen more than 60% over the past six months and ending 2025 down nearly 50%, making it the worst performer in the Nasdaq-100 last year. Source: Google Finance The decline followed a sharp rally earlier in 2025, when the stock surged alongside Bitcoin before reversing as risk sentiment shifted in the second half. Bitcoin itself remains elevated, trading about 28% below its all-time high but up sharply in recent sessions on rising volume. That divergence between Bitcoin’s resilience and Strategy’s equity weakness has fueled debate over whether the company now resembles an investment vehicle rather than an operating business. Critics, including economist Peter Schiff, have pointed to the stock’s drawdown as evidence that aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has weighed on shareholders.

That sharp month-to-month decline was driven by fewer large-scale heists, but the damage that did occur was still significant. Reports have disclosed a mix of scams and technical failures that together made December anything but risk-free. December Losses Fall 60% PeckShield tracked roughly 26 major exploits during the month. The largest single hit was an address poisoning scam that took about $50 million. In that scheme, victims were tricked into sending funds to an address that looked almost identical to a legitimate one. Other large losses included a $27 million drain from a multi-signature wallet tied to a private key leak, about $7 million tied to a Trust Wallet exploit, and roughly $3.9 million linked to issues involving the Flow protocol. These figures were reported across multiple outlets and match the totals PeckShield compiled. #PeckShieldAlert December 2025 witnessed ~26 major crypto exploits, resulting in total losses of ~$76M. This figure represents a decrease of over 60% from November’s total of $194.27M, marking a significant reduction in monthly losses. Notably: Wallet 0xcB80…819 lost $50M… pic.twitter.com/CNW3R6646j — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) January 1, 2026 Major Scams Still Cause Big Damage Address poisoning stood out because it relies on human error rather than a broken protocol. A small mistake — copying the wrong address — could wipe out a large transfer. Trust Wallet’s loss was linked to a browser extension weakness that allowed attackers to move funds. In some cases, reimbursements were being discussed by affected services. Reports have disclosed that private key exposure, even in wallets meant to be secure, continues to be a common root cause of big losses. Some experts say the fall in dollar losses reflects fewer massive breaches, not a vanishing of threats. Security teams have been more active, and some wallets tightened checks. But the methods used by attackers did not disappear. Scams that prey on mistakes, like the address trick, are still in play, and sophisticated intrusions remain possible. It was observed that a handful of incidents accounted for the bulk of December’s total, which helps explain the large swing in monthly totals. Close monitoring into these trends by regulators and other stakeholders like platform operators will continue as well. There have been growing pressures to provide better protections for exchanges and other wallets when there has been a breach; and for more timely actions after the compromise has been identified.

His exit from federal custody was made possible through the First Step Act, a prison reform law signed by Donald Trump during his first term in office. The news broke Thursday night after Ilya posted the announcement himself on X, saying, “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.” Ilya had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years behind bars. That came after he pleaded guilty to helping move billions of dollars in stolen crypto and confessed to the Bitfinex hack, which at current market prices totals more than $4 billion. His prison term factored in time already served after his 2022 arrest, giving him credit that slashed down his time inside. Trump’s First Step Act reduces sentences and puts crypto offenders on home confinement The First Step Act, passed in December 2018, was introduced as a bipartisan attempt to reduce the size of the U.S. federal prison system. It allowed inmates to earn early release or home confinement if they met certain behavior requirements and were deemed low risk under a federal assessment system. Ilya appears to have qualified, and as of Friday morning, a federal inmate search showed him set for official release on February 9. According to CNBC, a Trump administration official confirmed that Ilya “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” Heather Morgan, Ilya’s wife, also confirmed his early return in her own X post, two minutes after his, writing that,“The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart,” and attached a photo of them smiling together. The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart. 💜🙏🪬 https://t.co/toUJ0Bz70h pic.twitter.com/plsnktmJ5l — Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan (@HeatherReyhan) January 2, 2026 Heather had pleaded guilty alongside Ilya in the same case for helping launder the stolen funds and was sentenced to 18 months in February 2025, only to announce her early release in October. In a video posted on October 26, Heather appeared in a bathtub wearing just a towel and addressed her followers: “Why hello Razzlers, I have missed you,” using her rap alias, Razzlekhan. She ended with a nod to Trump: “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter.” The timing of his release lines up with the White House’s expanded use of the law in 2025 under Trump’s second term. On his first day back in office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who had been serving a life sentence. Then, in October, he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, the founder of Binance. CZ had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.

According to the model, all three could see some serious volatility in the weeks ahead, with sharp moves possible in both directions. Below is a breakdown of Qwen3-MAX’s two-sided forecasts, covering both bullish upside targets and bearish downside risks for each asset as 2026 gets underway. Ripple (XRP): Alibaba AI Predicts Rally Toward $5 by Year-End Under its bearish scenario, Alibaba’s AI projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could slide from its current price near $1.90 to roughly $1.50 and stay in that range as a worst-case outcome. You can already hear the loudest “I would take it” from XRP holders if that is truly the worst-case scenario. Source: Ailbaba AI Prediction On the optimistic side, Alibaba’s model envisions a powerful breakout, with XRP potentially jumping 82% to reach $3.50 or even $5 before the end of the year, nearly two times its previous all-time high. The launch of U.S.-listed spot XRP ETFs could act as a catalyst for fresh institutional inflows during the new year, mirroring early demand patterns seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Solana (SOL): Alibaba AI Forecasts a 400% Upside Move Alibaba AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 is to target $300 to $400 price range. That is almost 400% from the current price. Solana still looks like the coin of the cycle. Alibaba’s AI outlook points to Solana’s unmatched speed, booming DeFi activity, and growing institutional interest as the main drivers. With all of that happening while price continues to hold above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for a big move heading into 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. If it fails to rally, Alibaba AI predicts the price could drop below the $100 mark in the bearish scenario. Bitcoin (BTC): Alibaba AI Says Bitcoin Could Surge Past $150K After closing 2025 in the red and breaking the classic four-year cycle, Alibaba’s AI expects Bitcoin to come back swinging and push past $150K by the end of the year. The call is driven by accelerating spot ETF inflows and macro conditions that favor hard assets. In a stronger scenario, the model even sees Bitcoin peaking around $175K. Bitcoin is heading into 2026 at a pretty critical point. Price is getting squeezed, RSI is starting to curl up, and institutions keep stacking, even though prediction markets are not convinced a fast six-figure breakout is coming. On Polymarket, $120,000 is still seen as the most likely outcome, while BTC continues to coil inside a tight range around $89,000. Whatever move comes next is likely going to set the mood for the rest of the year. If Bitcoin can get a clean close above $90,500, that would break the triangle to the upside and likely send the price toward $92,800 first, then $95,000. A break below $87,000 would hurt the setup and open the door to a move down toward $85,800. For now, though, the structure still slightly favors the upside. Maxi Doge Is Built For Moments Like This When the market is having violent swings, uncertainty, and two-sided chaos across majors like XRP and Solana. History shows one thing clearly: memecoins thrive when conviction disappears. This is where Maxi Doge stands out. Maxi Doge is not trying to compete with Layer 1 narratives, ETF headlines, or institutional timelines. It exists for pure momentum, community-driven upside. It also reflexive moves when traders rotate out of crowded trades and into asymmetric bets. Every cycle, when majors stall or chop, capital looks for something louder, faster, and unapologetically speculative. That is exactly where Doge-style assets explode, and Maxi Doge is positioned as a high-beta expression of that rotation. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 71% APY through staking rewards. No promises of revolution. No overengineered roadmap. Just liquidity, attention, and crowd psychology. If 2026 starts with volatility, indecision, and sharp rotations, Maxi Doge is designed for that environment, not despite it.

Right now, XRP, Solana, and PEPE are standing out as some of the more interesting picks to watch as potential best crypto to buy. Even with Bitcoin bouncing back toward $89.5K, most altcoins are still down more than 50% from their all-time highs. Bitcoin has pretty much broken the classic four-year cycle narrative, so nobody can say with confidence what comes next. Still, when you look at fundamentals, SOL, XRP, and PEPE remain some of the most compelling names going into the new year, and here is why. Ripple (XRP) Could Head To $8 In 2026: Bank Analyst Predicts XRP just hit an eight-year low in exchange supply, which usually points to accumulation happening while price sits near lows. A big part of that is coming from ETFs, which have already pulled in over $1.4B since launch. That is close to 0.75% of the total XRP supply in just a couple of months. On top of that, analysts at Standard Chartered think XRP could rip more than 300% and push past $8 in 2026, fueled by spot ETF demand and the regulatory clarity XRP finally has.. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Solana (SOL) is The Top Chain In 2025 And Could Do It Again In 2026 Solana is not an emerging chain anymore. It closed 2025 as the top blockchain by revenue, bringing in over $1.4B and even beating Hyperliquid, which came in second. It also led all chains in DEX volume and ranked second only to Binance Smart Chain in active addresses back in November, and that was during one of the weakest periods for the network. Source: Cryptorank Another big milestone that cannot be overlooked is the approval of Solana ETFs. These are expected to bring fresh demand into the ecosystem, similar to the launch period when SOL logged 21 straight days of inflows. With all of this happening while price is still holding above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for an explosive move in 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. PEPE Could Do It Again And Start Memecoin Season PEPE is already up nearly 50% since the start of 2026. Last bear market, PEPE came out of nowhere and was one of the sparks that helped kick off the bull run. It basically created the memecoin season everyone still remembers. With the way it is moving now, a lot of people are starting to think it could pull that off again and bring memecoins back to life. That candle just smashed through a resistance that held for months around $0.000005, but there is still a long road ahead. After this push, RSI is sitting around 89, which is clearly overbought, not oversold. That means a pullback would be normal here. If PEPE manages to flip that old resistance into support on a dip, it could be setting up for a very strong year. It could end up recreating the same kind of rally it pulled off earlier in 2025. If that happens, the coin below stands out as one of the strongest candidates to follow that move. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Be The Next Coin To Follow This Move While large caps like XRP and Solana grind through key levels, early-stage capital is already rotating into higher-upside plays. One project pulling attention right now is Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2 focused on speed, scalability, and real utility. Something many investors feel Bitcoin itself lacks today. The project has already crossed the $30M raised milestone. This is notable given the current market environment and risk-off sentiment across altcoins. What stands out is timing. Bitcoin Hyper is gaining traction. While most speculative assets are still deeply discounted, the same setup that historically produced outsized returns once momentum returned. If 2026 turns into a broader risk-on year, Bitcoin Hyper sits in a strong position to benefit from that rotation. As always, high-upside plays come with higher risk. But for traders looking beyond large caps, Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up as one of the more watched narratives going into the year.

This surge in accumulation could be a strong signal, raising the odds of a bullish XRP price prediction in the near term. January has often been a favorable month for altcoins. Data from CoinGlass shows that Ethereum (ETH) , the top altcoin, has closed the month with gains in 5 of the past 9 years, hinting at a possible repeat performance across the market. Deep-pocketed participants may be positioning their portfolios to benefit from this trend if history repeats. According to data from Santiment, whales holding over 1 billion tokens added $3.6 billion worth of XRP between December 31 and January, pushing the total of XRP they own to 27.47 billion tokens. Although smaller whales have been progressively dumping the asset, bigger ones are accumulating, signaling a strong shift in sentiment. XRP Price Prediction: Crossing $1.90 Could Set the Stage for an Explosive Move Upwards XRP has increased by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. Trading volumes are still relatively low, accounting for just 1.5% of the token’s circulating market cap. Source: TradingView The $1.90 level is the key resistance to watch as a move above would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure. Such a trend reversal could mark the beginning of a strong move to $3. Since seasonality favors a bullish outlook, this could be a strong month for XRP from a statistical standpoint. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index has just flipped bullish by moving above its 14-day average, a signal that often marks the start of broader altcoin recoveries. If that momentum carries through, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could move first, especially as it brings Solana’s speed and low costs to Bitcoin’s secure network, while the window to get in early is still open. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $30M as Investors Bet on the Future of a Scalable Bitcoin The Bitcoin network has long struggled to grow beyond simple transactions, limited by slow speeds and high costs. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is breaking that barrier, raising over $30 million to build the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, one that can handle thousands of transactions at lightning speed and minimal cost. Powered by Solana’s high-performance tech, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers launch advanced dApps directly connected to Bitcoin, without forcing users to move their assets off the original chain. It’s a massive leap for Bitcoin utility, and investors are rushing in before it goes live. The Hyper Bridge is designed to receive BTC tokens in a designated Bitcoin wallet and mint the corresponding amount in the Hyper L2 almost instantly. Once in there, investors can earn yield, stake, and lend their assets. They will also get access to a growing list of DeFi apps, payment platforms, and even meme coin launchpads. The demand for $HYPER, the protocol’s native asset, should skyrocket as adoption accelerates. To buy $HYPER and seize this opportunity, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL for this token or use a bank card to invest in seconds.

SOL remains capped below stacked EMAs, with the 50-day near $136 as key resistance. Spot flows show early stabilization, but conviction remains limited. By Parshwa Turakhiya Solana (SOL-USD) is starting the new year locked in an uneasy balance, trading near the $127 to $128 area on Friday after months of steady compression. Price is no longer in free fall, but it has not reclaimed trend control either What is driving the tape is hesitation rather than fear. Selling pressure that dominated November and December has largely burned off, yet buyers remain selective, stepping in on dips instead of chasing upside. That dynamic explains why the opening sessions of 2026 have been defined by sideways trade rather than a sharp rebound. The tone feels defensive but calmer. Volatility has compressed, intraday swings have narrowed, and price has gravitated toward equilibrium. This is the market pausing to reassess after a difficult second half of 2025, not one bracing for immediate capitulation. The tension heading into January is clear. Sellers no longer appear urgent, but buyers are not confident enough to force a breakout. Until one side gains conviction, Solana is likely to remain range-bound, with rallies sold and dips bought selectively rather than aggressively. Daily structure remains defensive despite stabilization On the daily chart, the broader structure still leans bearish. Solana remains below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, which are stacked bearishly from roughly $126 through the mid-$160s. The 20-day EMA has flattened near the current price, a sign that downside momentum has slowed. However, the 50-day near $136 and the 100-day around $152 continue to represent heavy overhead supply. Until price can reclaim at least the 50-day on a closing basis, upside attempts are likely to be treated as corrective rather than the start of a new trend. SOL price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum confirms that assessment. The daily RSI is hovering just below 50, reflecting balance rather than strength. Strong reversals typically require RSI to push decisively back above the mid-50s. Solana has not done that yet. The market has neutralized oversold conditions, but it has not flipped into accumulation mode. Short-term structure offers a more constructive, though still cautious, view. On the 30-minute chart, Solana has reclaimed short-term trend support, with Supertrend flipping positive and price holding above SAR dots near $126. This favors dip-buying over selling rallies, but the advances have been choppy and incremental. Each push toward $128-$129 has met supply, suggesting short-term traders are fading range edges rather than positioning for continuation. As long as the price holds above the $125-$126 zone, near-term bias remains mildly constructive. A clean loss of that area would likely invite another sweep toward $122. Flows and positioning hint at stabilization, not conviction On-chain flow data adds important context. Spot netflows have been largely negative for months, reflecting steady distribution during the second half of 2025. That trend has recently eased. The latest readings show modest net inflows of around $3M as price stabilizes near $127. This is not aggressive accumulation, but it does suggest forced selling pressure has cooled. Historically, Solana has required sustained positive inflows to support durable rallies. For now, the data points to stabilization rather than a shift in behavior. Derivatives positioning tells a similar story. Futures open interest has ticked higher even as price moved sideways, sitting near $7.5B. That combination often signals traders rebuilding exposure after a washout, but it also raises the risk of volatility if price breaks out of its range. Long-short ratios show retail accounts leaning modestly long, while top traders remain heavily skewed long by account count. That divergence implies professional traders are positioning for upside, but cautiously, likely hedged and size-managed. Recent liquidation data supports that view, with shorts absorbing most losses during minor rallies while long liquidations remain contained. From a bullish perspective, the roadmap is defined but demanding. Solana needs to hold above $125 and reclaim $130 with authority. A daily close above the $136–$138 zone, aligned with the 50-day EMA, would be the first meaningful signal that trend control is shifting. If that occurs alongside improving spot inflows and expanding volume, a move toward $150 becomes plausible, reframing Solana as a recovery trade rather than a laggard. The bearish scenario remains straightforward. Failure to defend $125 would expose the lower end of the recent range near $122. A breakdown there risks reopening the path toward the psychological $110 level, especially if broader crypto sentiment weakens or Bitcoin rolls over. With the 200-day EMA still far overhead, macro shocks could quickly turn this quiet consolidation into another leg lower. Previously, we noted that Solana’s late-2025 declines were marked by persistent distribution and repeated failures at key moving averages. While selling pressure has eased, that structural backdrop has not yet changed. Confirmation is still missing. For now, Solana is no longer collapsing, but it is not trending either. Until price reclaims higher-time-frame resistance and spot flows turn decisively constructive, this remains a market defined by patience rather than momentum.

SOL is now up by 4% in a week, although it does remain down by 9.5% in a month and by 38% in the past year. These percentages may be disappointing, but there are strong reasons to believe that the Solana price is on the brink of a strong and sustained recovery. Not only do its fundamentals remain as strong as ever, but high-profile investors are also tipping the coin for big things, with Skybridge Capital founder and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci picking Solana as one of his top 3 alts to watch in 2026. Solana Price Prediction: Wall Street Investor Scaramucci Picks SOL as Top Altcoin for 2026 – $1,000 SOL Incoming? Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci picked Solana, Avalanche, and Toncoin as his 3 cryptocurrencies that could outperform the market this year. Explaining why he chose Solana, the entrepreneur and former lawyer said that SOL is “cheap, low cost, very fast, easy to use, easy to develop on.” And while clarifying that he believes in a “multi-coin world,” Scaramucci explained that he’s singling out Solana because it has all the key attributes a layer-one platform would need to succeed. Of course, one investor’s remarks on their own aren’t enough to move a major token such as Solana, yet we can see from its chart today that it may be very close to a breakout. Not only has a bullish pennant been forming over the past few months, but also SOL’s two primary indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are about to turn positive after weeks of negativity. Source: TradingView Indeed, Solana has been in an oversold position for so long now that a major rally is overdue, and it looks like such a rally could be beginning. Solana’s fundamentals also point towards strong growth this year, given that Solana remains the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of total value locked, at $9.3 billion. It’s also worth pointing out that its DEX volume, at $2.97 billion, is higher than Ethereum’s, which stands at a less impressive $1 billion. We’ve also seen the launch of several SOL ETFs in recent weeks , with 2026 likely to bring many more, pushing up the Solana price even higher. Based on this, we could see SOL hit $150 by the end of January, $250 by Q2, and then $1,000 by the end of 2026. Solana-Based Bitcoin Hyper is Ready to Launch Bitcoin’s First Ever Layer-Two Network: Next 100x Alt? As strong as Solana looks right now, traders may want to maintain a diversified portfolio in order to increase their exposure to potential gains. One way of doing this is to allocate some funds to presale coins, which, under the right conditions, can rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is what Solana-based layer-two network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is hoping to do, with its sale now having raised $30 million so far. Ringing in 2026 in style. 30M Raised! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/dZ4WkGMSvv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) January 1, 2026 This makes Bitcoin Hyper’s one of the biggest presales of the last 12 months, and indicates that it could become very popular once it launches. What’s interesting about Bitcoin Hyper is that it’s in the process of launching an L2 network for Bitcoin, one that is aiming to provide investors with a whole DeFi ecosystem in which to put their BTC to work. It harnesses Solana’s Virtual Machine, giving it a level of speed and scalability that will make it one of the fastest L2s around, while also making it compatible with Solana-based dapps. By depositing BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, users will receive a corresponding amount of HYPER, which they can then use with the L2’s growing range of dapps and protocols. In other words, they will be able to lend out the value of their Bitcoin, or they could stake their tokens and earn a yield, which currently stands at 39% APY. This is why Bitcoin Hyper has performed so well during its sale, which investors can join by going to the project’s official website . HYPER currently costs $0.013515, although this price will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts.

Instead of a broad-based rally, most altcoins suffered deep and prolonged drawdowns, erasing years of gains and forcing many investors out of the market. As 2026 approaches, sentiment around altcoins remains fragile. A growing number of analysts now warn that the worst may not be over, arguing that structural weakness, declining liquidity, and fading retail participation could drive another leg lower across the sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Market data reinforces this cautious outlook. The Crypto Total Market Cap, excluding the top 10 assets—commonly referred to as the OTHERS index—has collapsed by more than 50% since December 2024. Market capitalization has fallen from roughly $451 billion to around $182 billion in just twelve months, highlighting the scale of capital destruction across mid- and small-cap tokens. This sharp contraction reflects aggressive de-risking, weak demand, and sustained selling pressure across the altcoin market. However, not all analysts are convinced the altcoin cycle is finished. A smaller group points to historical precedents, arguing that periods of extreme underperformance and investor capitulation have often preceded powerful altcoin recoveries. From this perspective, 2026 could mark the delayed arrival of an altcoin season—if liquidity conditions improve and capital rotation resumes. Altcoin Trading Activity Remains Elevated Despite Price Weakness A recent CryptoQuant report challenges the widely held belief that this cycle has produced “no altcoin season.” According to the data, centralized exchange trading volume for altcoins—excluding the top five assets—has reached levels significantly higher than those seen in previous market cycles. In other words, altcoins are being traded more actively than ever, even as prices remain deeply depressed across much of the market. This divergence between volume and price helps explain the prevailing confusion. While many tokens have lost a substantial portion of their value, on-chain and exchange data show that activity has not disappeared. Instead, the market has undergone a structural shift. Retail participation has largely faded after months of losses, with many smaller investors capitulating and exiting positions. Their absence, however, has not resulted in lower overall trading activity. CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that altcoin dominance has increasingly concentrated among larger players. Whales and professional participants now account for a growing share of altcoin volume, using periods of low liquidity and weak sentiment to accumulate positions or actively rotate capital. From this perspective, the current phase may not signal the absence of an altcoin cycle, but rather its transformation. If whale-driven positioning continues and broader market conditions improve, these participants are likely to push prices higher to maximize returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Distribution Re-Emerges: BTC Enters A Fragile Price Phase OTHERS Market Cap Shows Prolonged Compression The OTHERS chart, which tracks the total crypto market capitalization excluding the top 10 assets, highlights the depth and duration of the ongoing altcoin correction. After peaking near $450 billion in late 2024, the market has lost more than half of its value, stabilizing around the $200–210 billion zone. This sharp contraction confirms that the altcoin market has experienced a full reset rather than a shallow pullback. From a technical perspective, the structure reflects prolonged compression. Price is currently oscillating around the 200-week moving average (red), a level that historically acts as a long-term equilibrium zone during transitions between bearish and recovery phases. The failure to reclaim the 100-week and 50-week moving averages suggests that upside momentum remains weak and that buyers lack conviction at higher levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Volume dynamics reinforce this view. While periodic spikes appear during sell-offs and relief rallies, there is no sustained expansion in volume that would signal broad-based accumulation. This implies selective positioning rather than widespread risk appetite. Importantly, the market is no longer making aggressive lower lows, indicating that forced selling may be largely exhausted. However, the absence of higher highs keeps the structure neutral-to-bearish. For a meaningful altcoin recovery, OTHERS would need to reclaim the $260–280 billion range and hold above key moving averages. Until then, the chart suggests consolidation, dominance by larger players, and a market still searching for a durable bottom rather than the start of a classic altcoin season.

The conversation addressed how investors can structure their portfolios for the future and how assets such as XRP can be used for long-term retirement without liquidation. Shifting Views on Retirement During the interview, Paul Barron noted that a growing number of individuals in their 40s are setting retirement goals earlier than previous generations. This reflects changing work expectations, as more people seek financial independence sooner rather than planning to remain in traditional employment for several decades. Claver explained that people typically move through different financial stages as they age. He observed that early adulthood is often shaped by learning through experience, while the following years focus on building wealth through careers, investment, and entrepreneurship. By midlife, priorities commonly shift toward restructuring personal goals and enjoying the results of earlier financial decisions. In later years, he stated that many begin to prioritize community support, knowledge sharing, and charitable work, especially when financial stability has already been secured. He added that the modern financial landscape offers more opportunities for wealth creation than previous eras, particularly because of the growth of digital assets. Diversification in Wealth Building Claver emphasized the value of diversification across all age groups. According to him, younger adults usually have a higher tolerance for risk and can allocate more resources to growth-oriented investments. As people approach retirement, he noted they tend to prefer safer assets and consistent returns. He referenced strategies commonly used by high-net-worth families. These approaches often allocate roughly 20–30% to liquid, low-risk holdings such as cash and government securities, another 20–30% toward equities, and approximately 10–20% to real estate due to its benefits for income generation and taxation. Business ownership is also an important component for wealth generation, while cryptocurrency typically represents a smaller allocation, usually between 1–5%, though more aggressive investors may choose to increase this portion based on risk preference.

He noted interest in assets including XRP, Bitcoin, HBAR, XLM, and yield products from networks such as Flare. Claver stated that DAG prioritizes helping clients establish proper structures for asset management rather than advocating for a specific product. He highlighted Wyoming as one of the most advantageous jurisdictions for digital asset ownership due to legal protections and favorable regulations. He revealed that his firm has assisted clients in forming nearly 7,500 limited liability companies in the state, many of which are used to store assets such as XRP, ETH, Solana, MATIC, Chainlink, and others. These LLCs are generally created as holding entities rather than trading entities so that assets qualify for long-term capital gains treatment and remain shielded from operational risk. He further noted that these structures can provide legal protection, as creditors cannot seize assets directly but may only request a charging order. To complement LLCs, DAG often integrates living trusts for clients. These trusts, which may be revocable or irrevocable depending on preference, ensure smooth inheritance without probate processes. Claver stated that the firm currently establishes living trusts for $500, with an upcoming increase to $1,000. Trusts can hold various assets, including digital currencies, property, vehicles, precious metals, and valuable possessions. Claver’s perspective illustrates how digital assets such as XRP can play a role in long-term retirement planning when combined with proper legal structure, diversification, and strategy. Rather than relying solely on selling tokens for profit, investors can position assets within LLCs and trusts to preserve wealth, maintain control, and pass holdings to future generations.

This analysis examines the complex technical landscape, historical precedents, and market dynamics shaping Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Support Battleground Technical analysts worldwide are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action as the cryptocurrency tests pivotal support levels established during April’s market correction. The monthly chart currently shows Bitcoin finding tentative support near its 20-month exponential moving average (EMA), a level that successfully contained the previous major correction. However, market observers note that repeated tests of this crucial zone could weaken its effectiveness over time. According to recent technical assessments, a monthly close below both the 20-month EMA and April’s low would represent a significant break in Bitcoin’s established uptrend. Such a development could potentially initiate a downward trajectory targeting the $50,000 psychological support level. This scenario gains additional credibility when examining historical patterns and market structure developments. Bearish Technical Indicators Converge on Cryptocurrency Markets Multiple technical warning signals are emerging simultaneously across different timeframes. On weekly charts, analysts observe the potential formation of a “dead cross” pattern, where the 20-week EMA threatens to fall below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This technical event last occurred in January 2022 and preceded significant market declines throughout that year. The technical landscape reveals several concerning developments: Support Level Erosion: Repeated tests of the April support zone may diminish its strength Pattern Formation: Potential Head and Shoulders pattern development suggesting trend reversal Momentum Shifts: Declining volume and weakening buying pressure across exchanges Timeframe Alignment: Bearish signals appearing simultaneously on weekly and monthly charts Bitcoin Key Technical Levels and Implications Technical Level Current Status Bullish Implication Bearish Implication 20-Month EMA Testing Support Holds as springboard for recovery Break triggers trend reversal April Low Support Under Pressure Establishes higher low pattern Confirms breakdown structure Weekly Dead Cross Forming Avoided through price recovery Confirms medium-term bearish shift $50,000 Level Psychological Support Major accumulation zone if reached Next major support if breakdown occurs Historical Context and Market Psychology Market analysts emphasize the importance of historical context when evaluating current technical developments. The cryptocurrency market has experienced similar technical setups during previous cycles, with outcomes varying based on broader market conditions, institutional participation levels, and macroeconomic factors. The current technical warnings mirror patterns observed before significant corrections in both 2018 and 2022, though market structure has evolved substantially since those periods. Institutional adoption has changed market dynamics considerably since previous bearish technical formations. Traditional financial institutions now participate more actively in cryptocurrency markets, potentially altering how technical patterns play out. However, technical analysis principles remain relevant as they reflect collective market psychology and trader behavior across all participant categories. Divergent Analyst Perspectives on Market Direction While technical charts currently favor bearish interpretations, cryptocurrency analysts remain divided about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Some market observers argue that current technical warnings may represent temporary volatility rather than sustained trend reversal. These analysts point to fundamental factors including institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and technological advancements as counterbalancing forces. Alternative perspectives suggest that technical breakdowns could represent buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Historical data shows that significant corrections often precede substantial rallies in cryptocurrency markets. However, proponents of the bearish outlook emphasize that risk management requires respecting technical warnings until proven invalid by price action. The analytical community generally agrees on several key points: Current technical setup warrants cautious positioning and risk management April support represents a critical line in the sand for market structure Volume and momentum indicators will provide crucial confirmation signals Broader market conditions will ultimately determine technical pattern outcomes Market Structure and Pattern Development Implications Technical analysts are particularly concerned about potential pattern developments that could amplify downward pressure. The possible formation of a Head and Shoulders pattern represents one such concern, as this classical technical formation typically signals trend reversal when confirmed. Pattern completion would involve breaking below the “neckline” support level, potentially triggering algorithmic selling and stop-loss orders. Market structure analysis reveals additional complexities. The relationship between spot markets and derivatives markets has created interconnected risks that can accelerate price movements in either direction. Liquidity conditions across different exchanges and trading pairs also influence how technical patterns develop and resolve. These structural factors add layers of complexity to straightforward technical interpretations. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Valuation Beyond pure technical analysis, macroeconomic conditions significantly influence cryptocurrency valuations. Interest rate policies, inflation data, and traditional market correlations all impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Current macroeconomic uncertainty creates additional headwinds for risk assets including cryptocurrencies, potentially exacerbating technical weaknesses. Historical analysis reveals that cryptocurrency markets often experience increased volatility during periods of macroeconomic transition. The current environment features multiple uncertain factors including monetary policy normalization, geopolitical tensions, and shifting regulatory landscapes. These external factors interact with technical patterns to create complex market dynamics that challenge simple predictive models. Several macroeconomic considerations currently affect cryptocurrency markets: Central bank policy shifts and their impact on risk appetite Traditional market correlations and decoupling patterns Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions Institutional adoption pace and capital flow patterns Conclusion Bitcoin price analysis reveals a cryptocurrency at a critical technical juncture, with multiple indicators warning of potential declines toward $50,000 if key support levels fail. The convergence of bearish technical signals across different timeframes warrants cautious market observation and appropriate risk management. While analyst opinions remain divided about ultimate outcomes, current technical evidence suggests respecting support level tests and pattern developments until market structure provides clearer directional signals. The coming weeks will prove crucial for determining whether Bitcoin maintains its broader uptrend or enters a more significant corrective phase. FAQs Q1: What is the 20-month EMA and why is it important for Bitcoin? The 20-month Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a technical indicator that smooths price data over 20 months, giving more weight to recent prices. It’s important because it has historically acted as dynamic support during bull markets and resistance during bear markets, making its current test significant for trend determination. Q2: How reliable are “dead cross” patterns in predicting Bitcoin price movements? While dead cross patterns (when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term one) have preceded significant declines historically, they’re not infallible predictors. Their reliability depends on confirmation from other indicators, trading volume, and broader market context. The 2022 dead cross did precede declines, but false signals can occur. Q3: What would invalidate the bearish Bitcoin technical outlook? The bearish outlook would be invalidated by a strong weekly close above current resistance levels, particularly with increasing volume. Sustained movement above the 20-week EMA with momentum confirmation would suggest the technical breakdown was false. Fundamental catalysts like major institutional adoption could also override technical warnings. Q4: How does current Bitcoin technical analysis compare to previous market cycles? Current technical warnings share similarities with 2018 and 2022 patterns but occur in a fundamentally different market context. Institutional participation, derivatives markets, and regulatory frameworks have evolved significantly. While technical patterns repeat, their outcomes may differ due to changed market structure and participant behavior. Q5: What time horizon do these Bitcoin technical warnings apply to? These technical analyses primarily address medium-term timeframes ranging from several weeks to several months. Short-term price movements can deviate from these patterns due to news events or liquidity conditions. Long-term trends require analysis of broader fundamentals including adoption metrics, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions.

56749426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258074,1767400511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Whale Accumulation: The Alarming Data Distortion That Could Mislead Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-accumulation-data-distortion/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Accumulation: The Alarming Data Distortion That Could Mislead Investors In a revelation that challenges prevailing market narratives, new analysis exposes how apparent Bitcoin whale accumulation might represent a dangerous data distortion rather than genuine institutional confidence. Senior CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno has identified critical flaws in how the cryptocurrency community interprets on-chain metrics, specifically warning that exchange wallet activities are creating misleading signals about whale behavior. This discovery comes at a crucial time for Bitcoin investors navigating complex market conditions in early 2025. Understanding the Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Narrative For years, cryptocurrency analysts have monitored whale addresses as key indicators of market sentiment. These large holders, typically controlling between 100 and 10,000 BTC, traditionally signal market direction through their accumulation or distribution patterns. However, recent data interpretations suggesting substantial whale accumulation may stem from fundamental misunderstandings of blockchain data structures. According to Moreno’s analysis, most circulating transaction data fails to properly filter exchange holdings from genuine whale activity. The cryptocurrency market has increasingly relied on on-chain analytics for investment decisions. Platforms tracking whale movements have gained significant traction among both retail and institutional investors. Nevertheless, the complexity of blockchain data interpretation presents substantial challenges. Exchange wallet reorganizations, for instance, can create artificial spikes in apparent whale activity that inexperienced analysts might misinterpret as accumulation signals. The Mechanics of On-Chain Data Distortion Blockchain analysis requires sophisticated filtering to distinguish between different types of wallet activities. Major cryptocurrency exchanges typically manage thousands of wallets containing customer funds, institutional holdings, and operational reserves. When these entities reorganize their storage systems, the movement of substantial Bitcoin amounts between addresses can appear identical to whale accumulation patterns on basic analytical platforms. Moreno emphasizes that data excluding exchange addresses actually indicates decreasing BTC holdings among genuine whales. This trend extends to addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a category that increasingly includes exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings. The distinction between ETF custodial wallets and traditional whale addresses further complicates accurate data interpretation. Expert Analysis from CryptoQuant’s Senior Analyst Julio Moreno brings substantial expertise to this analysis, with years of experience interpreting cryptocurrency market data. His previous accurate predictions about market cycles lend credibility to his current warnings about data misinterpretation. Moreno previously stated his belief that Bitcoin has already passed its cycle high and is heading toward a low, making his current analysis particularly relevant for investors assessing market direction. The implications of this data distortion extend beyond academic interest. Investment decisions based on misinterpreted whale accumulation signals could lead to substantial financial losses. Retail investors following apparent accumulation trends might enter positions at inopportune times, while institutional players could make allocation decisions based on flawed premises. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Data Interpretation Blockchain data analysis has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s inception. Early analysts worked with limited tools and basic metrics, while today’s sophisticated platforms offer hundreds of indicators. This evolution has created both opportunities and challenges for accurate market interpretation. The table below illustrates key differences between genuine whale activity and exchange-related movements: Characteristic Genuine Whale Accumulation Exchange Wallet Reorganization Transaction Pattern Consistent purchases from multiple sources Large transfers between known exchange addresses Address Behavior Long-term holding after acquisition Frequent movement between custodial wallets Timing Often correlates with market conditions Occurs during exchange infrastructure updates Data Source Reliability Requires exchange-filtered analysis Appears in unfiltered on-chain metrics Understanding these distinctions requires specialized knowledge of both blockchain technology and exchange operations. Analysts must consider multiple factors when interpreting apparent accumulation signals: Address clustering techniques to identify exchange-controlled wallets Historical behavior patterns of specific addresses Correlation with exchange announcements about wallet upgrades Verification through multiple data sources before drawing conclusions Market Impact and Investor Implications The potential misinterpretation of whale accumulation data carries significant consequences for cryptocurrency markets. Investment strategies based on flawed premises could amplify market volatility and create artificial price movements. Furthermore, the credibility of on-chain analytics as a decision-making tool faces challenges if basic metrics prove unreliable without expert interpretation. Institutional investors increasingly incorporate blockchain data into their analysis frameworks. Hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers have developed sophisticated models using whale movement indicators. The discovery of potential data distortions necessitates reevaluation of these models and their underlying assumptions. Retail investors face particular challenges in navigating this complexity. Without access to advanced analytical tools or expertise in blockchain data interpretation, they risk making decisions based on incomplete or misleading information. Educational resources about proper data interpretation become increasingly valuable in this environment. The Role of Analytical Platforms in Data Transparency CryptoQuant and similar platforms play crucial roles in improving data transparency. By developing more sophisticated filtering algorithms and educating users about interpretation challenges, these services enhance market efficiency. The ongoing development of better analytical tools represents a positive trend for cryptocurrency market maturation. Platform improvements might include: Enhanced exchange wallet identification algorithms Clear labeling of potentially distorted metrics Educational content about data interpretation limitations Multiple data visualization options showing filtered and unfiltered views Broader Trends in Cryptocurrency Market Analysis The challenge of accurate data interpretation extends beyond whale accumulation metrics. Multiple aspects of cryptocurrency analysis face similar complexities requiring expert navigation. Market participants must develop more sophisticated approaches to data evaluation as the ecosystem matures. Several trends are shaping cryptocurrency market analysis in 2025: Increased institutional participation bringing traditional financial analytical rigor Regulatory developments affecting data reporting requirements Technological advancements in blockchain analytics platforms Growing recognition of data interpretation as a specialized skill These developments collectively push the industry toward more reliable and sophisticated analytical practices. However, the transition period creates challenges for investors accustomed to simpler metrics and interpretations. Conclusion The apparent Bitcoin whale accumulation that has captured market attention may represent a significant data distortion rather than genuine institutional accumulation. Julio Moreno’s analysis highlights critical flaws in how exchange wallet activities can mimic whale behavior in unfiltered on-chain metrics. This discovery emphasizes the importance of sophisticated data interpretation in cryptocurrency markets, particularly as institutional participation increases. Investors must approach whale accumulation signals with appropriate skepticism and seek multiple verification sources before making decisions based on these metrics. The maturation of cryptocurrency markets requires parallel development in analytical sophistication, with this revelation about data distortion serving as an important milestone in that evolution. FAQs Q1: What exactly is meant by “Bitcoin whale accumulation data distortion”? This refers to the phenomenon where exchange wallet reorganizations and movements appear identical to genuine whale accumulation in basic on-chain analytics, creating misleading signals about large investor behavior. Q2: How can investors distinguish between real whale activity and exchange movements? Investors should rely on analytical platforms that filter exchange addresses, examine transaction patterns for consistency with accumulation behavior, and correlate movements with exchange infrastructure announcements rather than market conditions. Q3: Why does this data distortion matter for cryptocurrency investors? Misinterpreted whale signals could lead to poor investment timing and decisions based on flawed premises, potentially resulting in financial losses and increased market volatility. Q4: What does CryptoQuant’s analysis suggest about actual whale behavior? According to Julio Moreno’s filtered data analysis, genuine whale holdings (excluding exchange addresses) are actually decreasing, contradicting unfiltered metrics suggesting accumulation. Q5: How has cryptocurrency data analysis evolved to address these challenges? Analytical platforms have developed more sophisticated address clustering algorithms, better exchange wallet identification, and educational resources to help users properly interpret complex blockchain data.

In a Jan. 1 post on X, Jeff Yan framed “integrity” and “credible neutrality” as design constraints, not marketing language. Hyperliquid Reaffirms ‘No Insiders’ Ethos “Integrity has always been one of Hyperliquid’s core values. The house of all finance must be credibly neutral. This means no private investors, no market maker deals, and no protocol fees to any company,” he wrote , drawing a straight line between governance legitimacy and the absence of paid counterparties. That posture also extends to the origin story. “The initial state of any blockchain is a crucial part of its story that can never be erased. The original ethos of Bitcoin was a permissionless network accessible to all. Hyperliquid’s genesis distribution followed this spirit, going entirely to early users with core contributors excluded,” the post continued, adding that “the full distribution is verifiable onchain without obfuscation.” The founder acknowledged that this approach is not always convenient for would-be partners or ecosystem builders accustomed to preferential terms. “This principle of fairness frustrates a few users and builders who are used to special treatment,” he said, arguing it forces the community to “do things the hard way”, including “zero tolerance” for “integrity yellow flags” among team members. It is not the first time he has put the stance in blunt terms. In a January 2024 post, he summarized the policy as: “No investors. No paid market makers. No fees to the dev team… No insiders @HyperliquidX.” Lighter Debut Sparks Controversy The timing matters because the on-chain perpetuals category is now fighting not just over latency and liquidity, but over distribution optics, and Hyperliquid’s most visible new rival has become a live case study. Lighter, an Ethereum-based perpetual futures exchange that also operates as an Ethereum layer-2, launched earlier this week and has climbed quickly in the rankings. On Dec. 30, it airdropped 250 million LIT tokens, 25% of its 1 billion total supply, to early users, with another 25% set aside for future growth programs. The controversy is the other half. Lighter allocated 50% of supply to employees and investors, subject to a one-year lockup and three-year vesting, a structure that has triggered debate across DeFi about whether “community-first” narratives still hold when insiders retain an equal share of the cap table. In other words, Lighter’s launch has intensified the same ideological fault line Hyperliquid is trying to own: whether the cleanest on-chain market structure is primarily about product performance or about refusing the incentives that come with investors, paid liquidity, and insider allocations.

Versluis reminded the community that XRP began January 2025 at $2.08 and moved to $3.40 by the end of that month. The token then reached a yearly high of $3.66 in July before sliding back to close 2025 at $1.84, which represented an 11.5% YTD decline. “We just look at the fundamentals,” he said, adding that those who loudly predict extreme prices often end up wrong.

This change, according to the chairman, may be essential for future stock splits, as Ether’s price has a significant impact on the company’s value. Lee noted that BitMine’s share price is keeping up with Ether’s price . To effectively forecast future values, the executive carefully observed the ETH/Bitcoin ratio. Based on his argument, if, by any chance, BTC achieves a peak of $1 million, ETH would secure an all-time high of $250,000. At this point, Lee asserted that this rise would significantly increase the price of BitMine’s shares to highs he anticipated would be unreachable for many retail investors. Lee demonstrates a strong commitment to increasing the total number of BitMine’s shares In 2025, BitMine started as a Bitcoin mining and holding firm . Later, after careful consideration, the company shifted its focus to embracing an ETH treasury strategy. However, sources pointed out that BitMine continues to conduct some Bitcoin operations. Regarding his prediction, Lee declared that if ETH attained a peak of $250,000, BitMine shares could encounter an implied cost of approximately $5,000 each. Reports stated that this price is costly for several regular investors. To support this claim, the chairman mentioned that not everyone desires stocks to be priced at $500, $1,500, or $5,000; instead, a large group of individuals wants shares to be priced around $25. Meanwhile, apart from this finding, Lee also acknowledged that if ETH reaches an all-time high of $250,000, BitMine would be required to carry out a 100:1 stock split to maintain the share price at $25. With the move in place, the firm’s shares are expected to increase the total number to 43 billion. In a statement, Lee mentioned, “Right now, there are 426 million shares available. We aim to increase the authorized share count to 50 billion. However, that doesn’t mean we will actually create 50 billion shares; that’s just the highest number we want.” Reports highlighted that Lee is referring to the unit bias issue. Unit bias, in the basis of finance, is the psychological tendency for investors to prefer owning whole units of an asset (like a whole Bitcoin or share) over fractions, or to equate a low price per unit with better value, even when the total investment value is the same or a fractional amount of a pricier asset is a better investment. Lee’s idea faces criticism Regarding Lee’s proposal to increase the total number of BitMine’s shares, reports pointed out that several users shared negative responses to this suggestion on X. Some argued that it is unwise to raise the limit of authorized shares because this act would dilute the stock. This discussion made headlines, sparking controversy among individuals in the crypto ecosystem. One user remarked, “Tom, this seems shady and silly to raise the share count just because the stock could hit $500. You should wait until next year when it’s not in such bad shape.” Nonetheless, despite these concerns, recent reports highlighted that BitMine purchased approximately 32,938 ETH on Tuesday of this week for more than $102 million, based on current prices. Notably, as of December 2025, BitMine’s treasury had expanded to more than 4 million ETH, valued at over $12 billion. The firm also began staking ETH to generate income.

This investor began converting a massive $44.3 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) today, marking the end of a four-year holding period for the ETH assets. The transaction, first reported by blockchain analytics, represents one of the most notable single-asset shifts of 2025 and provides a compelling case study in long-term crypto investment strategy. Crypto Whale Executes $44.3 Million ETH to BTC Conversion According to data from AmberCN and corroborated by on-chain analysis, the whale address commenced the swap approximately five hours before reports surfaced. The entity exchanged 14,145 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) for 492 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Consequently, this transaction executed at a precise swap ratio of 1 WETH to 0.03478 WBTC. Therefore, the average purchase price for the WBTC settled at $90,014 per coin. This decisive action follows a period of accumulation that began in early 2022. Initially, the wallet accumulated a total of 22,344 ETH through major exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, and Poloniex. The average acquisition price for this Ethereum stash was $2,916 per ETH. The current move to convert a large portion into Bitcoin suggests a strategic reassessment of asset allocation. Market analysts are now scrutinizing the timing and potential motivations behind this substantial shift. Analyzing the Four-Year Holding Period and Market Context The whale’s four-year holding period is a critical piece of context. The accumulation phase in early 2022 occurred just after Ethereum’s all-time high in late 2021, during a broader market cooldown. Holding through the subsequent market cycles, including the bear market of 2022-2023 and the recovery phases, demonstrates a high-conviction, long-term approach. Now, the decision to rotate into Bitcoin may signal a change in that conviction or a tactical adjustment based on macroeconomic or protocol-specific factors. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 includes several evolving narratives. These include Bitcoin’s maturation as a institutional reserve asset, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades to its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and the regulatory clarity emerging in key jurisdictions. A whale of this size likely considers all these elements. Their move could be interpreted as a vote for Bitcoin’s relative stability or ‘digital gold’ narrative over Ethereum’s ‘world computer’ utility thesis, at least for a portion of their portfolio. Expert Perspective on Large Holder Behavior Historically, movements from large holders often precede or coincide with broader market trends. While a single transaction does not dictate market direction, it provides a valuable data point for sentiment analysis. Seasoned analysts note that whales typically move assets for several key reasons: portfolio rebalancing, risk management, capital deployment for other investments, or anticipation of specific market movements. The transparent nature of blockchain allows the market to observe these signals in real-time, adding a layer of strategic depth to crypto asset trading. The table below summarizes the key transaction details: Asset Sold Amount USD Value Holding Period Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) 14,145 $44.3 Million ~4 Years Asset Bought Amount USD Value Average Price Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) 492 $44.3 Million $90,014 per BTC Furthermore, using wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) indicates the swap likely occurred on a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or a decentralized exchange (DEX). This method offers privacy and direct asset control compared to centralized exchange transfers. The choice of instrument itself is a minor but insightful detail about the whale’s operational preferences. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The immediate market impact of a $44.3 million swap is often absorbed by liquid markets for BTC and ETH. However, the psychological impact can be more significant. Such a move can influence retail and institutional sentiment, potentially leading to increased discussion about the BTC/ETH ratio—a key metric watched by crypto traders. A shift of this scale from a long-term holder may prompt other investors to reevaluate their own allocations between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Key considerations for the market include: Sentiment Signal: Does this indicate a loss of confidence in Ethereum’s short-term prospects or a gain in confidence for Bitcoin? Technical Pressure: While $44.3M is a large sum, both ETH and BTC markets handle daily volumes in the billions. Direct price pressure may be minimal but observable. Follow-on Activity: Market participants will monitor if this whale completes the conversion of its remaining ETH holdings or if other large holders mimic the strategy. Ultimately, this event underscores the dynamic and transparent nature of cryptocurrency markets. Major player movements are public, providing a continuous stream of actionable intelligence for all market participants. It also highlights the evolving strategies within digital asset portfolio management as the asset class matures. Conclusion The $44.3 million crypto whale transaction from Ethereum to Bitcoin is a noteworthy event in the 2025 digital asset landscape. It exemplifies strategic portfolio management by large-scale investors after a multi-year holding period. While the anonymous whale’s specific motivations remain private, the move provides tangible data for analyzing market sentiment between the two premier cryptocurrencies. This action reinforces the importance of on-chain analytics and serves as a reminder that even in a decentralized ecosystem, the behavior of major holders offers crucial insights into market dynamics and evolving investment theses. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades have the potential to influence the market price due to the size of their transactions. Q2: Why use WETH and WBTC instead of native ETH and BTC? Wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) are ERC-20 token representations of native assets on the Ethereum blockchain. They are commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate seamless trading and lending without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. Q3: Does this large sale mean the whale is bearish on Ethereum? Not necessarily. Portfolio rebalancing is a common practice. The whale may still hold a significant amount of ETH (over 8,000 ETH based on reported accumulation) and might be taking profits, managing risk, or increasing exposure to Bitcoin for strategic diversification rather than expressing a purely bearish outlook on Ethereum. Q4: How can such a large trade be executed without drastically moving the price? The trade was likely executed using a decentralized exchange aggregator or a liquidity protocol that splits the order across multiple pools to achieve the best average price (a method known as ‘batch swapping’ or using ‘smart order routing’). Both BTC and ETH also have deep liquidity, allowing large orders to be filled with minimal slippage. Q5: Where can I track whale movements like this one? Several blockchain analytics platforms and services specialize in tracking large transactions and whale wallet activity. These platforms monitor blockchain data in real-time, flagging significant transfers, accumulations, and distributions from known large holders.

The annual decline was modest—around 6%—and negligible compared to historical drawdowns seen in prior bearish years. Yet despite its limited magnitude, the red close carries symbolic weight, suggesting a shift in market behavior rather than outright weakness. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Recent on-chain analysis from Axel Adler adds important context to this change. Data tracking cumulative Net Taker Flow shows that aggressive buying peaked around the New Year before fading. Since then, the balance of market aggression has tilted toward sellers, though not in an extreme way. The indicator currently sits in a moderate negative range, signaling that sell-side pressure has increased but remains far from capitulation levels. Historically, similar conditions have tended to coincide with heightened downside sensitivity rather than immediate trend reversals. In practical terms, this suggests that Bitcoin is vulnerable to further weakness if demand fails to recover, but it is not yet displaying the stress typically associated with deeper bear phases. The key takeaway is nuance. Bitcoin is not collapsing, but it is no longer behaving like an asset in a clean, momentum-driven expansion. The shift toward moderate sell pressure, combined with a rare red yearly close, points to a market transitioning into a more complex and selective phase rather than following its familiar cycle script. Derivatives Momentum Turns Cautious as Sell-Side Pressure Aligns Adler’s analysis highlights a growing shift in short-term market behavior through the Bitcoin Net Taker Flow momentum metric, which tracks how aggressively traders are positioning on the long or short side. Unlike cumulative flow, this indicator is designed to react quickly to sentiment changes, offering an early read on shifts in trader behavior rather than longer-term positioning. In recent sessions, this momentum gauge has rolled over decisively. After holding positive territory in late December, the smoothed reading has slipped into negative levels, now hovering around -0.3. While this does not yet reflect extreme stress, it places the market firmly in a moderate bearish pressure regime. The timing is notable: the momentum downturn occurred alongside a deterioration in cumulative Net Taker Flow, reinforcing the signal rather than contradicting it. This alignment matters. When both cumulative pressure and short-term momentum weaken together, it reduces the likelihood that the move is driven by noise or isolated positioning. Instead, it points to a broader shift in trader aggression toward the sell side. Adler notes that deeper downside risk would emerge if momentum continues to weaken, particularly if readings push beyond the -0.4 threshold. Conditions suggest controlled but persistent selling pressure. Bitcoin is not yet in capitulation territory, but the synchronized signals indicate that bearish forces currently have the upper hand, increasing sensitivity to any loss of price support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Distribution Re-Emerges: BTC Enters A Fragile Price Phase Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Momentum Remains Fragile Bitcoin is consolidating around the $88,000–$90,000 zone after a sharp pullback from its recent highs. Reflecting a market caught between stabilization and lingering downside risk. Price remains below the short-term and medium-term moving averages, signaling that bullish momentum has not yet been reclaimed. The 50-period moving average has turned into dynamic resistance, while the 100-period average is flattening, reinforcing the idea of a broader compression phase rather than an immediate trend reversal. Importantly, Bitcoin is still holding well above the 200-period moving average, which continues to slope upward. This suggests that, from a higher-timeframe perspective, the broader structure has not fully broken down. However, the loss of the $100,000–$105,000 region earlier marked a clear regime shift from expansion to distribution. Increasing sensitivity to sell-side pressure. Volume has notably declined during the recent sideways movement, indicating a lack of conviction from both buyers and sellers. This supports the view that the market is digesting prior excesses rather than aggressively repricing lower. Still, repeated failures to push back above the $92,000–$95,000 range highlight weak demand at higher levels. As Bitcoin holds the $85,000–$88,000 support band, consolidation remains the dominant scenario. A breakdown below this area would likely open the door to deeper retracements.

Schiff’s Bitcoin Prediction For 2026 In a Jan. 1 “Year-End Special” episode outlining his 2026 market forecasts, the renowned Bitcoin-critic argued that the cryptocurrency spent 2025 doing the one thing it wasn’t supposed to do in a year packed with pro-crypto narratives: fall. He framed that underperformance as the tell for what comes next. Schiff contrasted BTC’s year against both risk assets and his preferred macro hedges. Stocks finished 2025 higher, he cited the Dow up 13%, the S&P 500 up 16.4%, and the Nasdaq up 20.4%, while gold rose 64% and silver more than doubled. Bitcoin, he said, was the outlier on the wrong side. “Everybody on CNBC was pounding the table on when the year began was Bitcoin,” Schiff said, describing a narrative mix that included “a Bitcoin president,” “a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” heavy corporate buying, and the growth of ETFs. “Bitcoin was one of the only things that was down on the year.” He pointed to ETF performance to ground that claim, saying he checked where Bitcoin ETFs “closed because they’re done for the year,” and that they were “down just over 7.5% on the year,” even as the Nasdaq and gold posted large gains. Then he delivered the core of his setup: “If something doesn’t go up when everybody thinks it’s going to go up, that’s a pretty good indication that it’s going to go down,” he said. “If a market can’t go up on good news, that means all that good news is already priced into the market […] and that means all that it can do is go down.” Strategy As The “Poster Boy” Stress Test Schiff also used Strategy, the market’s most visible leveraged Bitcoin proxy, as his preferred diagnostic for sentiment and structural demand. He said Strategy finished 2025 at a new 52-week low and was “down 47.5% on the year” and “67% below its peak 52-week high,” calling it “the poster boy” for maximum BTC leverage. Schiff’s argument was not that Strategy failed to buy BTC but that the equity market was already pricing the downsides of the model. Schiff went further, claiming Strategy’s five-year average BTC cost basis sits around $75,000, implying only a modest gain with Bitcoin near $87,000. “That’s about a 16% gain, 3% a year over 5 years,” he said, arguing it undercut the pitch that the trade is a one-way compounding machine. He also claimed Strategy could not realistically exit at its average price without slippage, framing the “profit” as fragile in a liquidation scenario. From there, Schiff extended the thesis into 2026 market structure: if Strategy slows or stops buying, and if ETF flows flip decisively negative, marginal demand may not be there when it’s needed. “The ETFs are selling now,” he said. “They’ve gone from big Bitcoin buyers to consistent Bitcoin sellers.” While Schiff refrained from naming a BTC price target for 2026 in the video, the gold bug set a downside “minimum target” of about $50,000 mid-December 2025. He argued that Strategy could not fall as much as he expected without Bitcoin also taking a major leg lower. Year-End Special: My 2026 Economic and Market Forecasts https://t.co/pqy8bWJBjP — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 1, 2026 The Macro Backdrop Schiff’s broader 2026 macro call was a mix of weaker growth, stickier inflation, and intensifying political pressure on monetary policy, conditions he expects to support precious metals and pressure Bitcoin. He argued the Fed is already effectively back in easing mode: “it just went back to quantitative easing, even though it hasn’t officially acknowledged that that’s what it’s doing” and expects further rate cuts alongside a weakening dollar. He also tied tariffs to higher consumer prices and margin pressure, forecasting a 2026 environment where “the economy is going to be weak” while “inflation is going to be strong,” a combination he called “toxic.” Schiff’s practical conclusion for crypto listeners was direct: he urged viewers to “get rid of your Bitcoin above $87,000,” while reiterating that he expects capital to rotate toward gold and silver as “the bloom comes off that crypto […] tulip.” At press time, BTC traded at $89,517.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Peter Schiff,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This incremental yet significant one-point rise, reported by data provider Alternative on April 10, 2025, follows the index’s crucial migration from the ‘Extreme Fear’ category into the ‘Fear’ category just a day prior, potentially foreshadowing a change in market dynamics. Consequently, analysts and traders are scrutinizing this movement for clues about future price action and capital flows. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Climbs: Decoding the 29 Reading The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it quantifies sentiment where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 29, therefore, firmly places the market in the ‘Fear’ zone, but notably on an upward trajectory away from the extreme pessimism that often characterizes market bottoms. This index does not rely on a single metric; instead, it synthesizes data from six distinct sources to provide a holistic view. Specifically, its calculation incorporates: Market Volatility (25%): Current price swings compared to historical averages. Market Volume (25%): Trading activity and momentum on major exchanges. Social Media (15%): The volume and sentiment of crypto mentions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polling data from various community platforms. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. The recent climb to 29 suggests positive momentum across several of these components, particularly in trading volume and social media sentiment, which have historically led shifts in the broader index. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis Understanding the importance of the move to 29 requires examining historical patterns. For instance, prolonged periods in ‘Extreme Fear’ (typically below 25) have frequently coincided with accumulation phases, where long-term investors enter the market. The index’s escape from this territory often precedes periods of consolidation or gradual recovery. By contrast, a sustained move above 50 into ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ has historically correlated with market peaks and increased risk. The current reading, therefore, represents a transitional phase. Market analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often cross-reference this sentiment data with on-chain metrics, such as exchange net flows and holder composition, to validate the sentiment shift. Their recent reports indicate a decrease in coins moving to exchanges for sale, aligning with the less fearful sentiment reading. Expert Insight: The Mechanics of Sentiment Shifts Dr. Lena Vance, a behavioral finance economist at the Digital Asset Research Institute, explains the underlying mechanics. “The Fear & Greed Index is powerful because it quantifies the herd mentality,” she states. “A move from 20 to 29 may seem small, but in behavioral terms, it reflects a measurable reduction in panic-driven decision-making. Investors are beginning to process information more rationally, rather than reacting purely to negative headlines or short-term volatility.” This perspective is supported by data from the past month, which shows a stabilization in Bitcoin’s realized volatility and a modest increase in stablecoin inflows to exchanges—a potential precursor to buying pressure. Furthermore, the index’s weighting of social media sentiment captures the nuanced shift from apocalyptic narratives to more balanced discussions about protocol upgrades and regulatory clarity. The Impact of Volatility and Trading Volume The two heaviest-weighted components of the index—volatility and trading volume—deserve particular attention. Over the last fortnight, the 30-day volatility for Bitcoin has contracted by approximately 15%, according to data from TradingView. This compression often indicates a coiling period that can precede a significant price movement. Simultaneously, aggregate spot trading volume across major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken has risen by an estimated 8%. This combination of lower volatility and higher volume can signal the early stages of informed accumulation, as opposed to speculative frenzy. The table below illustrates the recent trend in these key metrics: Metric 30 Days Ago Current Reading Change Impact on Index BTC 30-Day Volatility 68% 58% -14.7% Positive for Sentiment Aggregate Daily Volume $42B $45.5B +8.3% Positive for Sentiment Social Sentiment Score 28/100 35/100 +25% Positive for Sentiment This data-driven improvement directly feeds into the index’s calculation, providing a factual basis for the climb to 29. Broader Market Implications and Future Trajectory The easing sentiment captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not exist in a vacuum. It interacts with macro-financial conditions, including interest rate expectations and global liquidity. In early 2025, with central banks in a holding pattern, cryptocurrency markets are finding their own footing based on internal supply dynamics and adoption milestones. A sentiment reading in the ‘Fear’ zone, but rising, typically suggests a market that is healing but remains vulnerable to negative shocks. For portfolio managers, this environment often dictates a strategy of phased re-entry or dollar-cost averaging, rather than all-in speculation. The index also provides a contrarian indicator for retail investors; historically, buying during periods of sustained fear has yielded positive long-term returns, though past performance is never a guarantee of future results. The key watchpoint now is whether the index can sustain its move and challenge the neutral level of 50, which would require consistent positive inflows and a supportive macro backdrop. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 29 represents a meaningful, data-backed shift in market psychology from extreme pessimism toward cautious optimism. This movement, driven by improvements in volatility, trading volume, and social sentiment, provides a quantifiable snapshot of a market in transition. While firmly remaining in the ‘Fear’ category, the upward trajectory suggests that the peak of investor capitulation may have passed, allowing for a more stable foundation for price discovery. Market participants should monitor this index alongside on-chain fundamentals and macroeconomic developments, as the journey from fear to greed is rarely linear. The current reading of 29 offers a hopeful sign that the market is processing information more calmly, a necessary step for sustainable long-term growth. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 29 mean? A reading of 29 places the market in the ‘Fear’ category, but on an upward trend from ‘Extreme Fear.’ It indicates that negative sentiment is easing, though investors remain generally cautious rather than optimistic or greedy. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is compiled and published daily by the data provider Alternative. It aggregates real-time data from volatility, volume, social media, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of Bitcoin’s price? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. It reflects current market emotion. Historically, sustained extreme fear has often preceded price rebounds, while extreme greed has signaled market tops, but it should be used alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools. Q4: Why is Bitcoin’s market dominance a factor in the index? Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. Shifts in dominance often reflect risk appetite; investors may flee to Bitcoin (‘digital gold’) during fear and into altcoins during greed, making it a useful sentiment gauge. Q5: How should a trader or investor use this index? Primarily as a contrarian indicator and a gauge of market temperature. Extreme readings can signal potential turning points. A rising index from fear levels, like the current move to 29, can suggest it’s time to research opportunities, but never to base a trade solely on this single metric.

This critical metric, updated on a continuous basis, provides a data-driven snapshot of capital rotation between the flagship cryptocurrency and the broader altcoin universe. Consequently, investors and analysts are closely monitoring this figure for early signs of a potential regime shift, as historical patterns suggest these cycles dictate portfolio performance for months. The current reading, far from the 75 threshold needed to declare an ‘altcoin season,’ underscores a period where Bitcoin continues to command market leadership and investor preference. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Mechanics CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index operates on a transparent and methodical calculation. Fundamentally, the index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. However, the algorithm makes crucial exclusions to ensure clarity; it deliberately filters out stablecoins like USDT and USDC, alongside wrapped tokens such as WBTC, which merely mirror Bitcoin’s price. The core calculation is straightforward: it measures the percentage of these top 100 assets that have outperformed Bitcoin. A result of 75% or higher triggers the official declaration of an altcoin season, a condition last observed in early 2021. Conversely, a score below 25 strongly suggests a Bitcoin season, where the pioneer cryptocurrency outshines most alternatives. The current score of 23 sits precisely within this Bitcoin-dominant territory. The Historical Context of Market Cycles Understanding the index’s current position requires examining past crypto market cycles. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the charge, attracting institutional and mainstream capital first. Subsequently, as Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates at higher levels, investor appetite for risk increases, leading capital to flow into altcoins with higher growth potential—this is the classic altcoin season. For instance, the index surged above 75 for extended periods during the 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 bull runs. The prolonged period since 2022, however, has been characterized by lower index readings, reflecting a post-bear market environment where safety and established store-of-value narratives favor Bitcoin. This cyclical rhythm between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance is a well-documented phenomenon in cryptocurrency market analysis. Implications of a Score of 23 for Investors The index’s low reading carries significant practical implications for portfolio strategy. Primarily, it suggests that a momentum-based approach focused solely on altcoins may underperform relative to a strategy with Bitcoin exposure. Market data from similar periods shows that during strong Bitcoin seasons, capital tends to be concentrated, leaving many altcoins struggling for momentum. Therefore, investors might prioritize Bitcoin and perhaps the largest, most liquid altcoins (often called ‘blue-chip’ alts) during this phase. Nevertheless, a low index can also signal a potential accumulation phase for selective altcoins before a possible rotation. Seasoned analysts often view extreme readings in either direction as potential contrarian indicators, though timing such shifts remains notoriously difficult. Key characteristics of a Bitcoin-dominant market (Index below 25) include: Heightened focus on macroeconomic factors like interest rates and inflation. Strong relative performance of Bitcoin against the total crypto market cap (BTC Dominance). Reduced trading volumes and volatility across smaller altcoin projects. Increased narrative strength around Bitcoin as a digital gold and institutional asset. Expert Analysis on Current Market Structure Market structure experts point to several concurrent factors explaining the low Altcoin Season Index. First, the regulatory environment in 2024-2025 has created uncertainty for many altcoin projects, particularly those deemed securities by regulators. This uncertainty naturally benefits Bitcoin, which has achieved clearer regulatory status in major markets like the United States. Second, the successful launch and adoption of Bitcoin spot ETFs have funneled billions in traditional finance capital directly into Bitcoin, creating a demand shock that altcoins have not yet experienced. Finally, the broader risk-off sentiment in global markets, influenced by geopolitical tensions, has made investors cautious about the high-beta nature of most altcoins. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s dominance, as reflected in the index score. Comparing Alternative Market Health Indicators While the Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool, prudent analysts cross-reference it with other metrics. For example, the Bitcoin Dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, often correlates strongly with this index. Other useful indicators include the performance ratio of Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) and the collective market cap of altcoins excluding the top 10. Currently, most of these complementary metrics align with the Altcoin Season Index’s message. The ETH/BTC ratio, a bellwether for altcoin strength, has remained in a downtrend or consolidation pattern, further validating the index’s low reading. This confluence of data from multiple sources strengthens the reliability of the current market diagnosis. The Path Forward: Monitoring for a Regime Shift Market participants are now watching for catalysts that could push the Altcoin Season Index higher. Potential triggers include decisive regulatory clarity for altcoins, the approval of spot ETFs for assets like Ethereum, or a sustained period of sideways movement in Bitcoin’s price that prompts investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. Historically, the transition from a Bitcoin season to an altcoin season is not instantaneous; it is a gradual process where the index climbs from lows, through a neutral zone, and finally breaches the 75 level. Therefore, a sustained move above the 50 level would be the first technical signal of strengthening altcoin momentum. Until then, the market structure favors the incumbent. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, registering at 23, delivers a clear and data-backed message: the cryptocurrency market remains in a phase of Bitcoin dominance. This reading, derived from the comparative performance of the top 100 assets, is a crucial tool for navigating complex market cycles. While it presents challenges for altcoin investors in the short term, it also provides a framework for anticipating future rotations. Ultimately, understanding this index allows for more informed, strategic decisions aligned with the prevailing market regime. As the crypto landscape evolves, this metric will continue to serve as an essential barometer for the ever-shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and the expansive world of altcoins. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 23 mean? It means that only an estimated 23% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. This indicates a market strongly favoring Bitcoin, known as a ‘Bitcoin season.’ Q2: How often is CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is calculated and updated on a continuous, real-time basis by CoinMarketCap, reflecting the most recent 90-day rolling performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q3: Has the index ever been wrong in predicting market cycles? The index is a descriptive metric, not a predictive one. It reports on what has already happened over a 90-day period. While it is an excellent indicator of the current trend, past performance does not guarantee future results, and external shocks can change market dynamics rapidly. Q4: Should I avoid altcoins entirely when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index suggests a challenging environment for broad altcoin momentum, but it can also be a period for researching and accumulating fundamentally strong projects at lower valuations. Portfolio allocation should always align with individual risk tolerance and investment horizon. Q5: What is the difference between this index and the ‘Bitcoin Dominance’ metric? Bitcoin Dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. The Altcoin Season Index measures price performance over time. While they often trend together, they are different measurements; one is a snapshot of value share, and the other is a snapshot of momentum performance.

Currently hovering just above $89,200, Bitcoin recently saw its 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages (SMAs) cross paths on December 8, a development highlighted by market analyst Ali Martinez on social media site X (previously Twitter). Bitcoin May Face 50%-60% Correction Martinez emphasized the importance of watching the behavior of these two moving averages on the weekly chart. Historically, each time Bitcoin has registered a death cross between the 10-week and 50-week SMAs, it has been followed by substantial corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 As seen in the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart below, past occurrences of such crossovers have led to price declines of 67% in September 2014, 54% in June 2018, 53% in March 2020, and 64% in January 2022. With the recent death cross-forming, Martinez suggests that if history is any guide, Bitcoin could face a correction between 50% and 60%, which would place its price anywhere between $50,000 and $38,000. Adding another layer of complexity to the analysis, market expert Mags has outlined two potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s near future. Two Scenarios For BTC’s Future Following Bitcoin’s downturn since its October highs above $126,000, it has been trading around the $85,000 mark for several weeks. Coinciding with this, Tether’s USDT dominance has broken out of its previous range, currently maintaining levels above the breakout zone. Since Bitcoin and USDT dominance exhibit an inverse correlation, Mags has identified two main scenarios moving forward. The first, a bullish scenario, hinges on the idea that if USDT dominance begins to decline, the current breakout could turn out to be a fakeout. Mags asserts that such a move could potentially ignite another expansion in Bitcoin’s price, possibly even leading to a new all-time high before any significant distribution occurs. Related Reading: Here’s How Much The XRP Price Will Be If It Overtakes Ethereum In Market Cap Conversely, Mags outlined a second scenario indicating early signs of a bearish structure. If the broader market trend weakens, Bitcoin might experience a temporary bounce, while USDT dominance forms a higher low near its mid-range before trending back upwards. In this case, BTC would exhibit a slow distribution pattern, marking neither a crash nor a rapid decline, but rather a gradual, choppy downward movement characteristic of initial bearish market behavior. The next move in USDT dominance is poised to play a crucial role in determining whether the current market represents a mere pause before further price continuation or the onset of an extended distribution phase leading up to a new all-time high.

Analyst Thinks So—Here’s Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-heading-0-08-analyst-thinks-heres-why/,newsbtc,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin could be on track for $0.08 based on this breakout from a consolidation channel. Dogecoin Has Fallen Under An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where Dogecoin could be heading based on a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Channel,” which is a type of Parallel Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Defined by Demand, Not Price: CryptoQuant Head Says Parallel Channels appear whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. When these lines have a positive slope, the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. This channel corresponds to consolidation that occurs toward some net upside. Like other such patterns in TA, the upper line acts a source of resistance, while the lower one provides support. A break out of either of these boundaries can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel may be a bullish signal, while a drop under it a bearish one. Like the Ascending Channel, there is also a pattern in TA called the Descending Channel, emerging when the opposite type of consolidation takes place. That is, when the price moves to a net downside between two parallel trendlines with a negative slope. Until recently, Dogecoin had been trading inside a multi-year Ascending Channel on the 3-day timeframe. The memecoin capped off 2025 with a breakout from it, as the chart shared by Martinez shows. From the above graph, it’s apparent that Dogecoin has escaped the long Ascending Channel with a fall below the support trendline. The memecoin has since been following a steep downward trajectory, a potential sign that the bearish breakout is in effect. Breakouts from Parallel Channels are considered likely to end up being of the same height as the distance between the trendlines. Based on this, the analyst has put the $0.08 target for DOGE. It now remains to be seen whether the asset will follow this trajectory or if it will see a rebound before long. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case In another X post, Martinez has highlighted how Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has also been trading inside a TA consolidation pattern recently. As displayed in the chart, the pattern in the case of Bitcoin is a Symmetrical Triangle, a channel that involves two lines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. BTC’s 4-hour price has been moving sideways in this pattern recently and based on its height, the analyst thinks that the coin may be set up for a 15% move. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.13, up more than 8% over the last 24 hours.

56754795,651974,1767412808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56754795.jpeg,Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Return To Losses Despite Elevated Price Levels – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/short-term-bitcoin-holders-return-losses-price/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin closed 2025 with a modest annual loss, breaking the familiar pattern of strong year-end performance and reinforcing growing concerns that the market may be transitioning into a more challenging phase in 2026. As macro uncertainty, fading liquidity, and weak risk appetite weigh on sentiment, an increasing number of analysts are openly discussing the possibility of a prolonged bear market. Still, price action tells a more nuanced story. Bitcoin remains locked in consolidation, and the absence of aggressive downside continuation has opened the door to a potential relief rally in the near term. On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds important context to this setup. Recent metrics show that short-term holders—investors who typically drive momentum during trend expansions—have slipped back into net losses. Aggregate realized profit and loss for this group has turned negative again, with margins hovering near -12%. This deterioration is notable because it is occurring while Bitcoin’s price remains relatively elevated compared to previous cycle drawdowns, suggesting that stress is building beneath the surface rather than after a full capitulation. Historically, periods where short-term holders operate at a loss often coincide with late-stage corrections or consolidation phases within broader market transitions. While this does not confirm a market bottom, it highlights fragility in near-term demand and reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is at a critical inflection point as 2026 approaches. Short-Term Holder Stress Signals a Market at a Crossroads Recent on-chain observations suggest Bitcoin is entering a delicate phase where short-term holders are increasingly under strain. When newer market participants slip into losses, it often signals that price has moved faster than incoming demand can comfortably absorb. In past cycles, this condition has typically appeared near the later stages of corrections or during extended sideways phases, rather than at the start of deep bear markets. What makes the current setup notable is Bitcoin’s proximity to the average acquisition price of short-term holders. This zone has historically acted as a psychological and behavioral battleground. When price hovers near this level, market reactions tend to intensify, as traders decide whether to cut losses or hold through uncertainty. The outcome often defines whether consolidation continues or volatility expands. Importantly, the scale of losses remains moderate compared to historical capitulation events. Previous market resets, such as those seen in 2018 or mid-2022, were characterized by far deeper and more prolonged stress among short-term holders. The absence of similar extremes today suggests that, while sentiment is weak, the broader market structure has not yet broken down. That said, persistent pressure on short-term holders reflects fragile near-term demand. If losses begin to narrow, it could signal stabilization and set the stage for a relief move. If they widen instead, downside moves are more likely to accelerate. Bitcoin Consolidates Below $90K Bitcoin price action on the 3-day chart shows a clear transition from trend expansion to consolidation following the sharp correction from the $120K–$125K region. After losing the 50-day and 100-day moving averages during the November breakdown, BTC accelerated lower before finding demand in the mid-$80K zone. Since then, price has stabilized and is now compressing just below $90K, suggesting that downside momentum has slowed materially. The current structure reflects a market in equilibrium rather than capitulation. Bitcoin is trading above the 200-day moving average, which continues to slope upward, preserving the broader bullish structure from a higher-timeframe perspective. However, the declining 50-day and 100-day averages overhead are acting as dynamic resistance, capping upside attempts and preventing a clean trend reversal for now. Selling pressure peaked during the November decline, but recent candles show reduced volume, consistent with seller exhaustion rather than aggressive accumulation. This often precedes a range-bound phase where the market digests prior gains. From a technical standpoint, holding the $85K–$88K region is critical. A sustained defense of this area keeps the consolidation intact and opens the door for a relief rally toward the $95K–$100K zone. Conversely, a decisive loss of this support would expose Bitcoin to a deeper retracement toward the 200-day average, shifting the short-term bias back to the downside.

His release took place on January 2, 2026, several years before the completion of his original sentence. Lichtenstein credited his early release to provisions under the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform law signed in 2018, which allows sentence reductions for inmates who participate in rehabilitation programs and demonstrate good conduct. How the First Step Act Led to an Early Release Lichtenstein was arrested in February 2022 alongside his wife, Heather Morgan, after US authorities traced nearly 120,000 BTC stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the arrest, the stolen Bitcoin was valued at approximately $4.5 billion, making it one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in US history. In November 2024, Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to money laundering conspiracy. However, according to his statement following release, his participation in rehabilitation and educational programs made him eligible for sentence reduction under the First Step Act. From a Mid-Market Bitcoin Era to a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Asset When the Bitfinex hack occurred in August 2016, Bitcoin was trading at roughly $600–$650 per coin. At those prices, the 120,000 BTC stolen during the breach were valued at approximately $72–$78 million, a substantial amount at the time but within a far smaller and less developed crypto market. Nearly a decade later, Bitcoin trades at levels that fundamentally reshape the historical significance of the incident. With Bitcoin priced around $90,000 in early 2026, the same 120,000 BTC would now be worth approximately $10.8 billion, representing an increase of more than 140 times compared with its estimated value at the time of the hack. Cooperation With Authorities Played a Role Beyond rehabilitation efforts, Lichtenstein cooperated with US authorities during ongoing investigations. In 2024, he testified in the case involving the cryptocurrency mixer Bitcoin Fog. The operator of the service was later sentenced to 12.5 years in prison, a development prosecutors cited as a significant enforcement milestone. Heather Morgan received a more lenient sentence of 18 months in prison and was released in October 2025 after serving approximately eight months. Following her arrest, she gained widespread attention on social media for her musical project under the pseudonym Razzlekhan, which became a viral internet phenomenon. What the Case Signals for Crypto Enforcement Lichtenstein’s release comes amid broader discussion about how the US justice system handles cryptocurrency-related crimes. In recent years, sentencing outcomes have increasingly reflected cooperation, restitution efforts, and rehabilitation rather than punishment alone. Following his release, Lichtenstein stated that he plans to use his technical background in cybersecurity, marking a notable shift from one of the most high-profile crypto crime cases toward a potential role in digital security. The case underscores how enforcement strategies and sentencing frameworks in the crypto sector continue to evolve as authorities balance deterrence, recovery of assets, and long-term reintegration.",News|Legal,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,0,0,EN,"{

This significant inflow, led dominantly by financial giant BlackRock, completely erased the prior day’s outflows and signaled robust institutional appetite for cryptocurrency exposure at the start of the new trading year. The data, compiled by industry tracker TraderT, provides a clear snapshot of investor sentiment and capital movement within this pivotal financial instrument category. Bitcoin ETF Inflow Breakdown and Market Leaders BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) commanded the day’s activity, single-handedly drawing $280.12 million in net inflows. Consequently, this massive vote of confidence from investors solidified IBIT’s position as the category leader. Other major issuers also reported positive flows, creating a broad-based rally. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $88.08 million, while Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) gathered $41.49 million. Furthermore, several other funds contributed to the total, including Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($12.99M), VanEck’s HODL ($8.26M), Ark Invest’s ARKB ($6.71M), and Invesco’s BTCO ($4.47M). Notably, Grayscale’s offerings also participated, with its flagship GBTC adding $15.42 million and its Mini BTC Trust attracting $6.35 million. The following table summarizes the key inflows for January 2, 2025: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (USD) IBIT BlackRock $280.12M FBTC Fidelity $88.08M BITB Bitwise $41.49M EZBC Franklin Templeton $12.99M Contextualizing the Spot Bitcoin ETF Phenomenon The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024 represented a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike futures-based products, these funds hold physical bitcoin, providing direct exposure to the asset’s price. This structure appeals to a wide range of investors, from large institutions to financial advisors and retail participants. The January 2nd inflow data is particularly noteworthy because it follows a period of typical year-end portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, which often pressures asset prices. Therefore, the strong start to 2025 suggests a renewal of strategic, long-term allocation rather than short-term speculation. Market analysts often interpret consistent ETF inflows as a measure of sustained institutional demand. These flows require the ETF issuer to purchase equivalent amounts of bitcoin on the open market to back the new shares. This process creates a direct, mechanical buy-pressure on the underlying asset. Over time, this dynamic can significantly impact bitcoin’s supply and demand equilibrium, especially considering its fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Trends Financial experts point to several factors driving this renewed interest. First, macroeconomic conditions, including monetary policy expectations, can influence asset allocation decisions. Second, the maturation of cryptocurrency custody and regulatory frameworks has reduced perceived operational risks for large institutions. Third, the competitive fee structures among ETF issuers, with some even offering temporary fee waivers, have made access more cost-effective. The dominance of traditional asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity in the inflow rankings underscores their existing, vast distribution networks and client trust, which are effectively channeling capital into the digital asset space. The trajectory of these funds is also closely watched for its impact on bitcoin’s market structure. As ETF holdings grow, the proportion of bitcoin supply considered “locked” in long-term investment vehicles increases. This trend potentially reduces the liquid supply available for trading, which can decrease market volatility and increase price stability over the long term. However, analysts caution that outflow days will also occur, reflecting normal market cycles and profit-taking behavior. Comparative Performance and Market Impact When comparing the performance of different spot Bitcoin ETFs, factors beyond daily flows become critical. Investors and advisors typically evaluate expense ratios, liquidity (as measured by average daily trading volume), and the reputation of the custodian safeguarding the assets. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have consistently led in net asset gathering since their launches, benefiting from their globally recognized brands and extensive relationships with wirehouses and registered investment advisors (RIAs). The collective action of these ETFs has several tangible market impacts: Price Discovery: They integrate bitcoin pricing into traditional equity market hours and systems. Accessibility: They provide a familiar, regulated wrapper for exposure, bypassing the complexities of direct custody. Legitimization: Their existence and growth signal regulatory acceptance to a broader investor base. Data from the broader blockchain ecosystem often reflects ETF activity. On days of substantial net inflows, on-chain analysts may observe larger-than-normal transfers of bitcoin to known custodian addresses, such as Coinbase Custody, which secures assets for multiple ETF issuers. This on-chain transparency provides a secondary layer of verification for the reported flow data. Conclusion The $463.9 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 2, 2025, marks a decisive and optimistic start to the year for cryptocurrency investment products. Led by BlackRock’s IBIT, this collective movement of capital demonstrates resilient institutional demand and a swift recovery from prior outflows. As these regulated vehicles continue to mature, their flow data will remain a crucial barometer for measuring mainstream financial adoption of digital assets like bitcoin. The sustained growth of these funds not only impacts bitcoin’s market dynamics but also solidifies the asset’s position within the modern, diversified investment portfolio. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds physical bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Q2: Why are net inflows important for Bitcoin ETFs? Net inflows are crucial because they represent new capital entering the fund. The issuer must use this cash to purchase an equivalent amount of bitcoin, creating direct buy-side pressure on the market. Consistent inflows indicate growing investor demand and can influence bitcoin’s price. Q3: What was the significance of the January 2, 2025, inflow data? The $463.9 million inflow was significant because it represented a strong reversal from outflows on the previous day. It signaled renewed institutional investment interest at the very beginning of the new trading year, often interpreted as a positive sentiment indicator. Q4: How does BlackRock’s IBIT differ from Grayscale’s GBTC? Both are investment products offering bitcoin exposure, but they have different structures. IBIT is a newly launched spot ETF with a competitive management fee. GBTC was converted from a closed-end trust into a spot ETF. Their fee structures, historical performance, and liquidity profiles differ, influencing investor choice. Q5: Do Bitcoin ETF flows directly cause bitcoin’s price to rise? While not the sole factor, significant net inflows contribute to upward price pressure. The ETF issuer’s market purchases to back new shares increase demand. However, bitcoin’s price is also affected by global macroeconomic factors, broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, and technological developments.

56757720,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888062,1767419400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56757720.jpeg,Moreno says Bitcoin is still distributing their assets instead of accumulating,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-whale-accumulation-overhyped/,cryptopolitan,"A dominant narrative about Bitcoin whales quietly hoarding BTC and bracing for a breakout has been upended by new on-chain analytics, which instead hint there is ongoing distribution among the largest holders — potentially dampening near-term bullish sentiment. Despite recent headlines proclaiming that large BTC wallets have been aggressively buying the dip, deeper blockchain data reveals a more nuanced reality. The head of research at the platform, Julius Moreno, cautioned that what appears to be whale accumulation is actually exchange-related activity inflating perceptions of buying. Exchanges frequently reorganize funds into other wallets, thereby increasing the number of wallets with massive balances . Moreno commented on X: “No, whales are not buying an enormous amount of Bitcoin. Most BTC whale data out there has been ‘affected’ by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances. This is why whales seem to have accumulated a lot of coins recently.” Blockchain analytics firms report that long-term Bitcoin holders — wallets that have held their BTC for extended periods — have shifted back into net distribution after a prolonged accumulation phase. The Coinbase executive comments come as sentiment among crypto market participants on social media has started the year strong, according to a Santiment analyst, who warned that further market upside depends on retail investors staying level-headed. “We need retail to continue to be a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, a bit impatient,” Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said in a video published to YouTube on Saturday. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators showing fear among market participants, Quinlivan said Santiment’s social media data points in the opposite direction. Moreno says Bitcoin is still distributing their assets instead of accumulating Moreno noted that adjusted data show that large holders are still in distribution mode, and not accumulation. The data also shows a continued drop in whale holdings, alongside falling balances among 100–1,000 BTC addresses, suggesting ETF outflows persist. Large holders typically make significant changes in the Bitcoin price; however, the market structure is adapting with the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have become substantial market participants. Aside from questions about whale accumulation, sentiment among long-term BTC holders has improved, as indicated by other onchain metrics. According to Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck , long-term Bitcoin holders have once again begun buying after suffering the biggest selling period in years. The trend suggests that the recent selling pressure on BTC might be beginning to ease. The recovery of Bitcoin remains tentative, although downside pressure to date hasn’t forced prices back to the sub-$80,000 range seen in November. BTC is currently trading just above the $90,000 mark. Nonetheless, Bollinger Bands, a key volatility gauge, suggest that a major price swing may be imminent.TradingView data shows Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands—the volatility bands set two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average—have tightened to under $3,500, the narrowest since July. Back in late July, a Bollinger Band squeeze capped a two-week consolidation between $115,000 and $120,000, marking the start of a three-month price expansion that ranged from $100,000 to $126,000. A similar pattern emerged in late February, with Bitcoin consolidating between $94,000 and $98,000 before a Bollinger Band squeeze preceded a decline to $80,000. Kim says Bitcoin will surpass $270,000 by February 2026 The social media predictor and self-proclaimed world’s smartest man, Kim, recently predicted that BTC could jump past $270,000 within a month next year. According to reports, the predictor cited both the growth and fragility of fiat currencies as reasons for his optimistic outlook, noting Bitcoin’s historical volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic trends. The social media personality has made several Bitcoin forecasts in the past that have not held up. He predicted in November that Bitcoin would more than double to $220,000 within 45 days, pledging any future profits toward church construction, yet the price surge never materialized. In addition to his bullish calls, Kim said BTC could replace the US dollar by 2026, labeling the current low as a short-term, manipulation-driven discount.

Related Reading: Ethereum Optimism For 2026: Analysts Share Bullish Forecast Despite Disappointing End-Of-Year Bitcoin Records Least Volatile Year On Friday, K33 Research data revealed that Bitcoin has recorded the least volatile year in the asset’s history. According to the chart, the flagship cryptocurrency saw its lowest volatility level, measured by the average deviation of daily returns, in 2025, hitting just 2.24%. The recent data shows that BTC fell below the previous lowest year on record, 2023, which registered 2.30% volatility. Moreover, it’s annual volatility has also ended below the 3% mark over the past three years, its lowest levels since 2016. This signals a “clear” diminishing trend, K33 Research noted, as Bitcoin’s volatility has been trending lower year by year, suggesting growing market maturity and stabilizing price action. Crypto trader Niels highlighted that “for the first time, BTC recorded its lowest annual volatility on record, lower than every cycle before it, including the early ‘wild west’ years and the post-ETF era.” As he explained, 2025 was “the calmest year in Bitcoin’s history” despite all the price movements of the years, including the Q4 daily corrections, which saw the flagship crypto retrace up to 16% in a single day. It’s worth noting that BTC’s deepest correction in 2025 saw the cryptocurrency drop nearly 36% in a two-month period, while previous cycles’ corrections recorded retraces of more than 50% during similar periods. Previously, Nic Carter addressed the negative sentiment brewing around Bitcoin and the broader market. He detailed that the market could be considered “boring” now because most of the questions that drove the historical volatility have been answered. Carter also asserted that the space matured significantly with “more serious businesses (…), [and] less chaos” in the industry. The Start Of The ‘Institutional Era’ In his X post, Niels also pointed out that the diminishing trend in Bitcoin volatility was fueled by the massive institutional participation, calling for “More capital. More long-term holders. More institutional participation. [and] Less emotional trading” for the future. Similarly, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley has affirmed that the overall crypto market was changing, driven by the significant decrease in regulatory risk, which has led to last year’s spike in institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. Notably, the market saw the second of wave of crypto Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) go live, with funds based on altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP breaking multiple records. In addition, the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) trend, led by Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, poured billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies in 2025. Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report In November, Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood stated that growing institutional adoption will be a powerful driver for long-term value for Bitcoin, noting that large-scale institutions have barely dipped their toes into the space and “have a long way to go.” Meanwhile, Head of Research at Grayscale, Zach Pandl, said in an January 2 interview that 2026 could be the “dawn of the institutional era” for crypto. He noted that rising demand for alternative stores of value and progress on bipartisan US crypto market structure legislation could drive Bitcoin to new highs in the first half of the year. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,240, a 1.54% increase in the daily timeframe.

56757993,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258131,1767420012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidations-short-squeeze/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a dramatic cascade of liquidations totaling approximately $250 million over a critical 24-hour period, with short positions bearing the overwhelming brunt of the losses. This substantial crypto futures liquidations event represents one of the most significant short squeeze scenarios in recent months, highlighting the inherent volatility and leverage risks within digital asset derivatives markets. According to comprehensive data from leading analytics platforms, Ethereum (ETH) led the liquidation wave with $120 million, followed closely by Bitcoin (BTC) at $108 million, while Solana (SOL) experienced $21.95 million in forced position closures. Crypto Futures Liquidations: Understanding the Market Mechanics The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event provides a textbook example of market dynamics in leveraged trading environments. Perpetual futures contracts, which dominate cryptocurrency derivatives trading, allow traders to use significant leverage—often 10x to 100x their initial capital. Consequently, even relatively modest price movements can trigger automatic position closures when maintenance margin requirements fail. Market analysts note that this particular liquidation wave occurred during a period of unexpected bullish momentum across major digital assets. The resulting short squeeze forced cascading position closures as prices moved against traders betting on declines. Derivatives markets serve crucial functions for price discovery and risk management. However, they also amplify volatility through leverage effects. When numerous traders hold similar directional positions with high leverage, the market becomes vulnerable to liquidation cascades. These events typically unfold rapidly as initial liquidations create additional selling or buying pressure. This pressure then triggers further liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. The cryptocurrency market’s 24/7 operation means these events can develop at any time, often catching traders off guard during low-liquidity periods. The Anatomy of a Short Squeeze A short squeeze represents a specific market condition where traders who have sold assets expecting price declines must urgently buy them back to cover their positions. This covering activity creates additional upward buying pressure, which then forces more short positions to liquidate. The resulting feedback loop can produce rapid, dramatic price increases. Historical data from traditional finance shows similar patterns in equity markets, though cryptocurrency markets exhibit amplified effects due to higher leverage availability and continuous trading. Ethereum Leads With $120 Million in Liquidations Ethereum’s derivatives market experienced the most substantial impact during this crypto futures liquidations event, with $120 million in positions forcibly closed. Remarkably, short positions accounted for 89.48% of these liquidations, indicating overwhelming directional consensus among leveraged traders. This percentage translates to approximately $107.38 million in short positions liquidated against just $12.62 million in long positions. The disparity highlights how market sentiment had become excessively bearish on Ethereum before the price movement that triggered the squeeze. Several factors contributed to Ethereum’s prominent role in this liquidation event. First, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization with exceptionally deep derivatives markets. Second, ongoing network upgrades and regulatory developments create uncertainty that encourages leveraged positioning. Third, Ethereum’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets means it often moves in tandem with Bitcoin while exhibiting higher beta characteristics. Traders frequently use Ethereum futures for directional bets on the altcoin market’s overall health. Total Ethereum Liquidations: $120 million Short Position Percentage: 89.48% ($107.38M) Long Position Percentage: 10.52% ($12.62M) Primary Exchanges: Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Deribit The concentration of liquidations across specific price levels reveals important market structure information. Order book data indicates that liquidation clusters occurred near key technical resistance levels that many traders expected to hold. When these levels broke, stop-loss orders and forced liquidations created a vacuum of selling pressure that accelerated the upward move. This pattern demonstrates how derivatives markets can influence spot prices during periods of high leverage utilization. Bitcoin’s $108 Million Liquidation Event Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, witnessed $108 million in crypto futures liquidations during the same 24-hour window. Short positions comprised 83.95% of this total, representing approximately $90.67 million against $17.33 million in long liquidations. While Bitcoin’s percentage of short liquidations was slightly lower than Ethereum’s, the absolute dollar amount remained substantial due to Bitcoin’s larger market size. This event underscores Bitcoin’s continued dominance in derivatives trading volume despite growing altcoin markets. Bitcoin’s liquidation patterns often differ from altcoins due to its unique market characteristics. Institutional participation in Bitcoin derivatives has grown significantly in recent years through regulated products like CME Bitcoin futures. However, the majority of high-leverage trading still occurs on offshore exchanges. The recent liquidations primarily affected these offshore markets, where leverage limits often exceed 100x. Market structure analysis reveals that Bitcoin liquidations frequently cluster around round-number psychological price levels, such as $60,000 or $70,000 thresholds. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Liquidation Comparison Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Total Liquidations $108 million $120 million Short Percentage 83.95% 89.48% Short Value $90.67M $107.38M Long Value $17.33M $12.62M Market Cap Rank #1 #2 The timing of Bitcoin’s liquidations relative to Ethereum’s provides insights into market leadership dynamics. In traditional cryptocurrency market cycles, Bitcoin typically leads price movements with altcoins following. However, in this particular event, Ethereum’s liquidations slightly led Bitcoin’s in both timing and intensity. This pattern suggests evolving market relationships where major altcoins increasingly influence broader sentiment rather than simply reacting to Bitcoin movements. Solana’s $21.95 Million Liquidation Surge Solana experienced $21.95 million in crypto futures liquidations, with short positions representing a staggering 91.05% of the total. This percentage translates to approximately $19.98 million in short liquidations versus just $1.97 million in long liquidations. Solana’s exceptionally high short liquidation percentage reflects its status as a higher-volatility asset that attracts substantial speculative trading. The network’s rapid growth and technical innovations have made it a favorite among derivatives traders seeking amplified returns. Several unique factors contributed to Solana’s disproportionate short liquidation percentage. First, Solana’s derivatives markets have grown exponentially alongside its spot market expansion. Second, the asset’s historical volatility exceeds both Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating more frequent liquidation events. Third, Solana’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets varies more significantly than established assets, creating additional basis risk that can surprise leveraged traders. Finally, Solana’s smaller market capitalization means individual large positions can disproportionately impact prices and trigger cascading liquidations. Market Impact and Recovery Patterns The immediate market impact of these crypto futures liquidations included increased volatility and temporary price dislocations across affected assets. However, markets typically absorb liquidation events within hours or days as liquidity returns and equilibrium reestablishes. Historical analysis shows that post-liquidation periods often feature reduced leverage in the system as risk-averse traders decrease positions. This deleveraging can create calmer trading conditions temporarily before leverage gradually rebuilds. The funding rates on perpetual contracts typically normalize after such events, though they may remain elevated if directional sentiment persists strongly. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis The $250 million crypto futures liquidations event, while substantial, represents a moderate-sized liquidation wave compared to historical extremes. During previous market cycles, single-day liquidation totals have exceeded $1 billion multiple times. For instance, the May 2021 market correction triggered approximately $8.6 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse precipitated over $1 billion in daily liquidations. These comparisons provide important perspective on the relative scale of market stress. Nevertheless, the recent event’s significance lies in its composition rather than absolute size. The extreme concentration in short liquidations—exceeding 83% across all major assets—indicates a market caught leaning heavily in one direction. Such lopsided positioning often precedes trend reversals or accelerated moves as crowded trades unwind. Market technicians refer to this as “contrarian indicator” conditions, where extreme sentiment readings suggest impending mean reversion. The cryptocurrency market’s history contains numerous examples of similar setups preceding substantial price movements. May 2021: $8.6 billion liquidations during China mining ban announcement November 2022: $1+ billion liquidations during FTX collapse March 2020: $1+ billion liquidations during COVID market crash June 2022: $800+ million liquidations during Celsius crisis The increasing sophistication of cryptocurrency derivatives markets has changed liquidation dynamics over time. Early markets featured simpler mechanisms with fewer safeguards, leading to more frequent and severe cascades. Modern exchanges implement circuit breakers, auto-deleveraging systems, and insurance funds to mitigate extreme events. However, as trading volumes and leverage availability have grown, the absolute dollar amounts at risk have increased correspondingly. This evolution represents the natural maturation of financial markets as they scale. Risk Management Implications for Traders The recent crypto futures liquidations event offers crucial lessons for risk management in leveraged trading. First, position sizing relative to account equity becomes paramount during volatile conditions. Traders using excessive leverage relative to their risk tolerance frequently become liquidation candidates during normal market fluctuations. Second, diversification across assets and position directions provides some protection against single-direction liquidation events. Third, monitoring funding rates and open interest can provide early warning signals of crowded positioning that might precede squeezes. Advanced traders employ several strategies to navigate high-leverage environments. These include using stop-loss orders judiciously (while recognizing they can exacerbate moves during illiquid periods), maintaining adequate margin buffers above exchange requirements, and avoiding maximum leverage even when available. Some institutional traders utilize options strategies to hedge leveraged futures positions, creating defined-risk exposures. The growing availability of cryptocurrency options markets has facilitated more sophisticated risk management approaches in recent years. Exchange Mechanisms and Safeguards Cryptocurrency exchanges employ various mechanisms to handle liquidations while maintaining market integrity. Most platforms use a mark price system that averages prices across major exchanges to prevent manipulation through isolated price spikes. When positions reach maintenance margin thresholds, exchanges typically attempt to close them through their order matching systems. If insufficient liquidity exists at reasonable prices, some exchanges trigger auto-deleveraging (ADL) systems that close opposing profitable positions to cover losses. More sophisticated platforms maintain insurance funds accumulated from liquidation fees to cover deficits without ADL. Regulatory Considerations and Market Evolution The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency derivatives continues evolving across jurisdictions. Some regions have implemented leverage limits for retail traders, while others prohibit derivatives entirely for non-accredited investors. These regulatory developments aim to protect consumers from the risks demonstrated by liquidation events. However, they also create fragmentation as traders migrate to less-regulated venues. The ongoing tension between innovation and protection represents a central challenge for policymakers worldwide. Market structure evolution will likely continue addressing liquidation risks through technological improvements. Decentralized derivatives protocols offer alternative approaches using automated market makers and on-chain liquidation mechanisms. While currently smaller than centralized exchange volumes, these decentralized platforms provide different risk profiles and transparency benefits. Their growth could eventually reduce systemic risks from concentrated liquidation events by distributing exposure across multiple venues and mechanisms. Conclusion The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event highlights the ongoing risks and dynamics of leveraged cryptocurrency trading. With short positions accounting for the overwhelming majority of losses across Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana markets, this episode demonstrates how crowded positioning can precipitate rapid reversals. These crypto futures liquidations serve as a reminder that derivatives markets both reflect and amplify underlying spot market movements. As cryptocurrency markets mature, understanding liquidation mechanics becomes increasingly important for all participants—from retail traders to institutional investors. While such events create short-term volatility, they also contribute to market efficiency by removing excessive leverage and resetting sentiment extremes. FAQs Q1: What causes crypto futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance requirement for their leveraged position. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent negative balances, often creating cascading effects when many traders hold similar positions. Q2: Why were short positions disproportionately affected in this event? Short positions faced massive liquidations because prices moved upward against traders betting on declines. This created a short squeeze where covering positions added buying pressure, forcing more liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. Q3: How do crypto futures liquidations impact spot prices? Liquidations can significantly impact spot prices through several mechanisms. Forced buying to cover short positions increases demand, while forced selling of long positions increases supply. These flows can create temporary price dislocations and increased volatility. Q4: What percentage of traders typically experience liquidations? Exact percentages vary by market conditions, but industry estimates suggest approximately 70-90% of retail leveraged traders eventually experience at least one liquidation event, highlighting the risks of trading with high leverage. Q5: How can traders avoid futures liquidations? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks through proper position sizing, maintaining adequate margin buffers, using stop-loss orders strategically, avoiding maximum available leverage, and monitoring market conditions for signs of crowded positioning.

After a tumultuous period, total market capitalization has surged back above $3 trillion. However, many investors are left wondering what the new year has in store for digital assets. Institutions Forecast Bullish Crypto Prices For 2026 According to a recent report by analysts at Bull Theory, the past year proved to be robust for traditional markets, particularly for metals, while cryptocurrencies fell short of expectations. Silver surged by 160%, and gold followed suit with a 66% increase. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) wrapped up 2025 down approximately 5%, despite several positive indicators, such as consistent purchasing by Strategy, strong inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and growing institutional interest.

Standard Chartered targets Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of 2026, and JPMorgan projects a price of $170,000. Meanwhile, Citi’s base case stands around $143,000, with a more aggressive bull case suggesting a potential rise to $189,000. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest envisions a long-term scenario where Bitcoin could hit $500,000, contingent on widespread institutional adoption. Tom Lee from Fundstrat anticipates Ethereum will trade between $7,000 and $9,000 by early 2026, fueled by the tokenization of real-world assets. New Regulations And Economic Optimism The analysts further highlighted that, unlike previous years, this cycle looks distinct in several key aspects. For one, crypto is no longer encumbered by operating within a legal gray area. New regulatory frameworks, particularly in the US, are poised to offer clearer guidelines, reducing uncertainty and facilitating easier access for institutional investors. The anticipated changes aim for simplified regulations that could enhance market structure while broadening institutional participation beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, several factors suggest that a sharp movement in the crypto markets could be on the horizon. The end of quantitative tightening on December 1, 2025, coupled with a growing GDP, signals a conducive environment for crypto.

Overall, as the new year begins, the crypto market finds itself in a position of underperformance rather than excess. This contrasting state often results in rapid repricings as gaps are closed in response to liquidity alignment. As a result, Bull Theory analysts believe that 2026 could very well be the year when these disparities start to correct, leading to a potentially bullish environment for cryptocurrencies.

Turkmenistan’s Crypto Legislation Now In Effect As reported by Associated Press, the Asian nation of Turkmenistan officially recognized mining and exchanging cryptocurrency as legal on Thursday. The move comes after President Serdar Berdymukhamedov signed a law back in November, which allowed crypto companies to obtain registration starting January 1st. Located in Central Asia, Turkmenistan was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union before gaining independence following the USSR’s dissolution in 1991. Today, the country is considered as one of the world’s most isolated, due to strict state control over media, internet access, and foreign business activity. Home to a population of over seven million, Turkmenistan’s economy is dependent on its natural gas reserves, which rank as the fifth largest in the world. China is its main customer at the moment, with a pipeline project aimed at supplying gas to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in the works. For a nation known for tight state control, the move to embrace crypto marks a notable shift. Though, while the country is now open to mining firms and exchanges, it still hasn’t legalized digital assets as a form of payment, currency, or security. Turkmenistan isn’t the only Central Asian nation to have made developments related to the digital asset sector recently. Uzbekistan, located north of Turkmenistan, signed on an initiative related to stablecoin payments in November, approving a regulatory sandbox launch for January 1st. Elsewhere in the region, Iran has taken an even bolder approach, offering to sell advanced weapons systems to foreign governments for crypto, according to a report from Financial Times. The nation is willing to exchange ballistic missiles, drones, and warships for digital assets in a bid to bypass western financial controls, per the report. Bitcoin Has Been Stuck In Consolidation Recently While nations move forward with crypto regulation, the market has been stuck in a phase of consolidation lately, with the Bitcoin price unable to settle on a direction. As the below chart shows, BTC has been ranging between $85,000 and $90,000 during the last couple of weeks. The market slowdown has naturally not been restricted to just Bitcoin; the altcoins have also faced stale price action. Ethereum, for example, has positive returns of over 2% in the past month, which are not too different from BTC’s small decline of 2%. Over the past day, Bitcoin has once again climbed toward the upper end of the range, with its price currently trading around $89,500. Considering the recent pattern, it’s possible that this recovery effort may also fizzle out, but it only remains to be seen how things will play out in the coming days.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto exchanges|crypto mining|Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan Crypto,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/elon-musks-grok-says-ripple-cto-david-schwartz-is-satoshi-bitcoin-creator-heres-why/,timestabloid,"A well-known figure in the XRP community has placed an old mystery back into focus through a direct exchange with Elon Musk’s AI model, Grok. Vet (@Vet_XO), a validator on the XRP Ledger, posted an image containing four individuals who have appeared in past speculation around Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity (anonymous Bitcoin creator). He then asked Grok to remove everyone who isn’t Satoshi from the image. hey @grok remove everyone who is not satoshi from this image. pic.twitter.com/9bvTHWE2dH — Vet (@Vet_X0) January 2, 2026 Grok’s Opinion on Satoshi’s Identity The image featured David Schwartz, a prominent figure in the crypto space who recently announced that he would step down from his role as Chief Technology Officer at Ripple. Alongside Schwartz, it featured Hal Finney, a pioneering cryptographer and the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It also showed Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer known for his significant contributions to the development of digital currency and smart contracts. It also featured the late cybersecurity expert Dan Kaminsky, who was a renowned white-hat hacker and a prominent figure in the field of network security. Grok replied with an edited image that removed three people, leaving only David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. For years, many in the crypto world have speculated that Schwartz is Satoshi , and Grok’s response has drawn renewed attention to these claims. Is Schwartz Really Satoshi? Vet rejected the outcome and challenged the reasoning behind it. He showed skepticism and pushed Grok to explain why it singled out Schwartz. Grok followed up with a clarification. The AI emphasized uncertainty and referenced existing narratives around Satoshi’s identity. Grok pointed to long-running speculation tied to Schwartz’s background . It referenced his early work in cryptography and distributed systems, including patents dating back to the late 1980s, as well as his role at Ripple. Grok also noted that Schwartz has publicly denied being Satoshi Nakamoto and has said he first learned about Bitcoin in 2011 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Schwartz Remains Part of the Theory David Schwartz remains part of Satoshi discussions largely due to public perception and the narratives circulating online. Community speculation often highlights high-profile crypto figures with leadership roles in major projects, and Schwartz fits that profile. His visibility on social media, participation in XRP Ledger development, and engagement with crypto debates give his name repeated exposure. Multiple notable figures have also directly and indirectly suggested that Schwartz is Nakamoto , and the speculation is unlikely to die soon.

The latest rejection came after reports emerged about several explosions felt across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, which were linked to potential strikes by the United States. The cause has not been confirmed yet, but US President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned Venezuela of ground strikes, and deployed a navy task force in the Caribbean. Additionally, the BBC reported that the Trump administration was aware of the explosions today, but there’s no official statement yet. The CNN added that several areas of the city were left without power after the explosions, and agency journalists said they could hear the sound of an aircraft. Although the strikes have not been confirmed to be initiated by the US, BTC’s price felt the consequences immediately after the reports started to go live. The asset, which has been prone to experience enhanced volatility in times of attacks between different nations, stood at around $90,500 after it touched $91,000 yesterday.

About 40% of the top 100 Bitcoin treasury firms are valued by the market at less than the net asset value of their BTC holdings, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. At least 37 companies in the group now trade at discounts to NAV, a notable reversal from conditions seen in Q2 and Q3 2025 when the king coin was changing hands at all-time-high levels. During the first three quarters of the year, most treasury firms possessed sizable premiums and could issue equity above the value of their Bitcoin, raise capital, and buy more coins without immediate shareholder dilution. Nearly 200 public firms now hold more than 1 million Bitcoin collectively, valued at roughly $96 billion in 2026. Among the top 5 BTC DATs by holdings are Strategy , with 672,497 BTC, and MARA Holdings, which owns 53,250 coins. Twenty One Capital holds 43,514 Bitcoin, Metaplanet controls 35,102, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury holds 30,021. Is the Bitcoin DAT model a failure? mNAVs fall steeply When Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) began buying Bitcoin through convertible notes and equity, Bitcoin’s price was slightly above $11,000. Fast forward to 5 years later, an all-time-high value of $126,000 in October must have been a reason for MSTR shareholders to smile, but that wasn’t entirely the case. The model began to falter as equity valuations slipped and BTC prices tanked by over 30% in just three months, not to mention several firms like Strategy had bought the highs. Once stock prices fell below NAV, the business model of issuing new shares to buy Bitcoin became uneconomical, exposing firms to market pressure and investor criticism. A December report from BitcoinTreasuries.net showed that only one BTC treasury company, France-based The Blockchain Group, outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025, since the benchmark US stocks index returned 16% over the year. Every other treasury company was well behind the index, and about 60% of them spent more acquiring BTC than those holdings are currently worth. Pioneers Strategy traded at more than double the value of its Bitcoin last year, but its shares are now at a 17% discount to NAV. Smaller players like Sweden’s H100 Group trade at a 32% discount, Vanadi Coffee trades at a 61% discount to its BTC value, alongside five to six firms near parity, including Brazil-based OranjeBTC. Any modest equity selloff could push them below NAV and make them ripe for a takeover if Bitcoin’s price drop continues. Echoes of distress, delisting on MSCI, and DATs dubbed rug pulls Bitcoin treasuries are being blasted by some naysayers in the crypto community, who believe the companies’ buying spree led to a crypto market pull-down causality. “Every single one of these companies is simply a pump N dump rug pull on their common shareholders. And no, preferred equities won’t save your shitty scheme when you don’t have a profitable underlying business, will not save your shitty stock. You should avoid any company that calls itself a ‘DAT’ or ‘Bitcoin treasury company’. Bunch of scammers and idiots tbh,” complained one user on X. Some companies, seeing the whiplash of red mNAVs, are also stepping back, including Prenetics, a health-sciences firm that began buying Bitcoin in 2025. Cryptopolitan reported that it stopped adding coins on December 4 and will now focus on IM8, a nutritional supplement brand co-founded by former England football captain David Beckham. “We are making disciplined strategic decisions that reflect our experience as operators and our commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value,” Danny Yeung, Prenetics’s chief executive officer, said in a press release. In other related news, index provider MSCI’s decision to exclude companies holding significant BTC reserves from its global benchmarks will be made on January 15. If the NYSE-listed company greenlights its exclusion, estimates from BTC for Corporations show the DATs would be forced to sell between $10 billion and $15 billion over a year. BTC for Corporations, a group advocating corporate Bitcoin adoption, held discussions with MSCI leadership before 2025 came to a close. “We had a very constructive conversation,” said George Mekhail, the group’s executive director.

Despite record FY2025 revenue of $766M and positive operating income of $319M, CLSK's free cash flow remained deeply negative at -$461M, driving continued dilution and increased debt. Management turnover and a $1.15B convertible bond raise signal strategic urgency, with initial data center conversions targeting Sandersville and Texas facilities (200MW each). Full conversion of 1.4GW capacity could yield $1.4B–$2.1B annual revenue, but immediate, complete transition is not the current outlook. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner in transition to using its power capacity for AI data centers. It's a late shift and change of tone from previous guidance, and it's one worth a follow-up. While I think this will be a better business over time than BTC mining, tight cash flows and capital needs make the current valuation unfavorable. Summary of Previous Thesis When I wrote about CleanSpark in March, I was cautious about its status as a BTC mining pure play. This was something that made the company stand out, as other BTC miners were converting many of their assets into data centers. The move, broadly accepted across the BTC mining industry, leverages electrical capacity for an end use that can produce reliable free cash flow. CleanSpark's decision to stay out of it was, therefore, a curious one. Screenshot from previous thesis (Author's display of 10K data) Seen above, their BTC mining business was a cash burner, regularly requiring more shares to be issued, in order to finance operations. CleanSpark was betting that competitors' shift to data centers would make their mining operations more competitive, as it would give them a greater share of the global hash rate and therefore improve their BTC output. Nevertheless, BTC still needed to appreciate considerably to turn cash flows positive. Lacking those in the meantime and threatened by continual dilution that would kill off realized upside, I gave CLSK a cautious Hold rating. Updates and Subsequent Events In the months that followed, CleanSpark proceeded with the BTC mining pure play approach. They expressed growing confidence that the business would become self-sufficient, announcing a financing deal with Coinbase ( COIN ) in April. They stated that a portion of BTC mined would be used to sustain operations. Later, they touted reaching 50 exahashes per second in their mining. CEO Zach Bradford stated: As we look to the future, CleanSpark has laid the foundation to achieve 60 EH/s and beyond. This expansion capacity aligns with the Company's broader strategy to grow with capital efficiency only possible for an operator that has achieved escape velocity . ""Escape velocity"" was a term used in both cases, expressing that CleanSpark was near to achieving what I was afraid they would not achieve: an end to cash burn and shareholder dilution. Cash Flow Statements (Q2 & Q3 Fiscal 2025 Forms 10Q) In spite of this, there was still a total cash burn of $234M in fiscal Q3, after accounting for operating cash flow, purchase/disposition of miners, BTC proceeds, and purchase of fixed assets. If Bradford believed CleanSpark was reaching escape velocity, the numbers were not yet bearing it out. Whether he was right or wrong, Bradford resigned as CEO shortly after fiscal Q3 results were released. He was replaced by Matt Schultz, Bradford's fellow co-founder and predecessor as CEO (from 2014 to 2019). In early September, new management announced a strategic pivot to data centers. CleanSpark was finally on the AI-hyperscaler train. Stepping outside of self-funding operations, CleanSpark began raising capital again, such as a recent $1.15B convertible bond offering in November . End of Fiscal 2025 Financials Fiscal 2025 was, in large part, a record year for the company, with revenue reaching an all-time high of $766M. This also supported operating income finally turning positive, reaching $319M. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) For many folks this is a welcome sign, but the cash flow situation reveals some underlying cracks, coming out of the year. Cash Flow Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) While cash burn was lessened somewhat by reduced capex on miners and liquidation of BTC, operating cash flow still decreased overall for the year, reaching -$461M. BTC 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) Some likely recall the recent decline of the price of BTC in the fall. For CleanSpark, the fiscal year ended before this drop. They were mining BTC at prices above $100K for a large portion of the year. Fiscal 2025 Form 10K In order to raise capital and plug the gap, CleanSpark shares outstanding, basic and diluted, have both grown in the year, so the consequences of dilution persisted. Liabilities (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) They ended the year with significantly more debt, largely from the credit facilities they started throughout the year. Then there are the convertible bonds issued later that I mentioned earlier. Overall, it's a somewhat improved picture but still a company with serious capital needs. Outlook and Valuation CLSK trades for about $10 per share and a market cap of $2.6B. As free cash flow has been negative, the task is to determine how following the shift to data centers can tip the scales into positive cash flow. Much of what I will say next will work with very general estimates, given the lack of specifics at this stage. To start, I've looked at similar deals by other companies to give us an idea of what rates they could make with their electrical capacity: Applied Digital's ( APLD ) contract with a hyperscaler Another deal between APLD and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) Ionic Digital's contract with Nscale These contracts show that a data center can make about $1M to $1.5M per MW each year. I've included a table for your convenience. Author's display of data center revenue estimates Total electrical capacity was reported to be 1.4 GW in November. If we assume their total portfolio of capacity were used for data centers today, one could imagine revenue of $1.4B to $2.1B annually, dependent on the rates of local markets and the like. Of course, that assumes complete and immediate conversion of these assets, which isn't the outlook. During the Q4 earnings call , management largely highlighted the Sandersville and Texas facilities as the first places that could be converted to AI/HPC uses. Q4 Fiscal 2025 Investor Presentation These two sites are reported to have about 200 MW of capacity each that could be active by 2027. They could contribute about $400M to $600M in revenue. As the business currently has gross margins of about 55% just on its BTC mining, the underlying assumption is that the average margin for AI/HPC would be meaningfully superior to this. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) The devil is going to be in the details, but a look at key expense items currently show that these assets could produce an additional $100M to $200M in operating income. The upfront capex, however, means that free cash flow would likely not turn positive for some time, however. Liquid Assets (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) As CleanSpark ended fiscal 2025 with only $43M in cash and is slow to liquidate its $967M BTC holdings, this is why they had to do the $1.15B convertible bond offering in November and have leaned into their BTC-backed credit facilities instead. The cash from the convertibles should be sufficient to cover capex needs for the next couple of years (if recent years are a guide). Additional cash burn from operating expenses will force them to raise more capital at some point, and this will likely entail some kind of a dilutive offering. When I see a market cap of $2.6B, I think the fundamentals should practically produce a cash flow multiple of about 10 within a few years. The timing of things makes it seem unlikely they will hit such a milestone in a few years without diluting more. The guidance in the call, after all, was: Our focus is on building a capital stack, which minimizes dilution . Management realizes what I realize and can only promise to dilute as little as possible. I think CLSK needs to be more conservatively valued for it to reflect a real shot at undervaluation. A market cap of $1.5B, which would make an entry price of $5.80 or less, is one that seems to allow for a slower realization of positive cash flow and likely some kind of margin of safety. That isn't to say that a very patient investor couldn't see upside on CLSK at the current valuation, but we're likely thinking very far into the future and imagining that execution goes very well for the most part. Fiscal Q1 results, as well as monthly updates of power capacity, will be important in assessing just how large the pipeline is and how much higher-margin revenue could be realized that isn't on the table right now. Conclusion CleanSpark likely made a pivot that needed to be made, even before BTC prices declined. Nevertheless, strategic transitions take time and cost money. CLSK meanwhile is valued in the billions, when generating cash in the hundreds of millions without more dilution remains an open question. Investors can simply wait for a more reasonably priced entry, and for that reason, I maintain my previous Hold rating.",CLSK,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56762333,652046,1767429053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56762333.jpeg,Crypto Could Become Iran’s Secret Weapon In Global Arms Trade,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-could-become-irans-secret-weapon-in-global-arms-trade/,bitcoinist,"Reports have disclosed that Iran’s state arms export arm, the Ministry of Defence Export Center (Mindex), is openly offering to accept cryptocurrency as payment for military hardware. According to the Financial Times and follow-up coverage , the listings on Mindex’s export platform include items ranging from drones and air defense systems to warships and ballistic missiles. The move was reported in January 2026 and marks a clear change from past, quieter uses of digital assets. Accepting Crypto And Barter To Avoid Banking Limits Based on reports, Mindex has placed offers that mention cryptocurrency, Iranian rial, and barter as possible forms of payment. The listings encourage potential buyers to contact Iranian officials to negotiate contracts. Sanctions from the US, the UK and the EU have shut many conventional payment routes, and Iranian officials appear to be using multiple channels — crypto among them — to keep export deals moving. Listings Include Broad Array Of Hardware Mindex’s catalogue, as described by multiple outlets, lists equipment across a wide spectrum: small arms and ammunition, drones, missiles, air defense systems, and naval vessels. Reports say Mindex claims commercial ties with about 35 countries. That number helps show the scale Iran’s exporters say they serve, even while facing banking isolation. How Crypto Fits Into Iran’s Cash Flows According to authorities outside Iran , the country has used cryptocurrency before to move value around borders. US Treasury findings previously tied more than $100 million in crypto flows to Iranian oil-related activity that skirted sanctions. Observers warn that accepting crypto for arms could make tracking payments harder, depending on the coins and the custody arrangements used. Some analysts say public listings could attract buyers who already avoid SWIFT and traditional banking. Governments and sanctions experts have raised alarms. If deliveries happen after crypto payments are received, enforcement agencies will face fresh tracing challenges. The US has a record of sanctioning networks that used crypto to support Iranian programs, and officials have signaled they will monitor new tactics closely. Some countries may consider tighter rules on crypto services used in cross-border defense deals. Based on reports , the export agency presents the offers as open to negotiation and claims sanctions will not stop contracts from being fulfilled. What remains unclear is how many, if any, arms contracts will actually be completed using crypto. There are also unanswered questions about which cryptocurrencies would be accepted, how escrow and delivery would be handled, and what intermediaries might be involved.

56762520,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888098,1767429950,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56762520.jpeg,"Crypto social activity jumps at start of 2026, Santiment reveals",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-starts-2026-impressive-social-chatter/,cryptopolitan,"Crypto sentiment among investors and social media participants started the new year on a positive note, according to a Santiment analyst. According to the analyst, any upside movement in the market will depend on retail investors staying level-headed. In a video published recently, Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan mentioned that for the market to see an upside, it needs retail investors to continue being a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, and a bit impatient. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators pointing to fear among market participants, the analysts pointed out that Santiment’s social media data among investors and market participants points the other way. Crypto kickstarts the new year with an impressive social chatter According to Quinlivan, the signs are very positive at the moment, noting that it was always a bit of a concern in the past years. He mentioned that in this case, it might just be a metric that shows that we are gradually coming back from the holidays. Quinlivan also added that he is not particularly worried about any FOMO, adding that it could also enter the market if Bitcoin surges to $92,000 quickly. Bitcoin is currently trading around $89,930 at the time of publication, up 1.77% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Quinlivan noted that a quick rise in Bitcoin’s price to reach this level will show the “true reaction from retailers.” “Are they starting to pour in money because they’re saying Bitcoin goes up? That would be bad,” he said. Retail euphoria in crypto markets has always pushed towards all-time highs or cycle peaks, and going by history, the market has dropped shortly after. In addition, analysts have previously argued that when the market excitement gets too intense, the crypto market has always moved in the opposite direction to what most people expect. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a metric that measures the overall crypto market sentiment, posted a “Fear” score of 29 in its Saturday update. The Index has been hovering around the “Fear” and “Extreme Fear” region since early November. Analysts predict a short-term rally for Bitcoin January has always been a historic month for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with average gains of 3.75% for BTC and 19.07% for ETH, according to data from CoinGlass. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan has reported that Bitcoin could face a difficult start to the new year after the premier asset gave back most of the gains it accrued in the past three months. The token dominated headlines in the early part of 2025, thanks to Donald Trump shining a light on it after taking back the White House. However, some analysts have added that they expect Bitcoin to undergo a rebound, even if the recovery will not last. Citi analyst Alex Saunders has mentioned that near-term support could come from the expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds, which will continue to provide better access to retail and institutional investors. He highlighted that the prediction assumes adoption will continue and ETF inflows would reach $15 billion, but noted that the level can only sustain the prices for a short while. Meanwhile, attention will remain on Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as another beacon for price movement. According to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the company’s enterprise-value-to-holdings ratio, which is above the 1.0 level, reassures the company that it would not consider selling its holdings during stress. “If this ratio stays above 1.0 and MicroStrategy can eventually avoid selling bitcoins, markets will likely be reassured, and the worst for bitcoin prices will likely be behind us,” Nikolaos said.

This data, captured on April 15, 2025, reveals a market in delicate balance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and regulatory developments affecting digital asset trading worldwide. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratio Analysis Perpetual futures represent one of cryptocurrency’s most innovative financial instruments, combining traditional futures mechanics with unique funding rate mechanisms. These derivatives maintain constant exposure without expiration dates, making their positioning data particularly valuable for sentiment analysis. The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio specifically measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions across exchanges. Market analysts consistently monitor this metric because it provides real-time insight into trader expectations and potential price direction biases. Exchange-specific data reveals subtle variations in trader behavior. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, reported a slight long bias at 50.02% long versus 49.98% short. Similarly, OKX showed marginally more bullish positioning at 50.07% long against 49.93% short. Bybit demonstrated the strongest long preference among the three platforms at 50.16% long compared to 49.84% short. These minor differences nevertheless indicate distinct trading community characteristics across platforms. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios (24-Hour Data) Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Overall Aggregate 49.85% 50.15% -0.30% (Slightly Bearish) Binance 50.02% 49.98% +0.04% (Neutral) OKX 50.07% 49.93% +0.14% (Slightly Bullish) Bybit 50.16% 49.84% +0.32% (Moderately Bullish) Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Dynamics Perpetual futures markets operate through sophisticated mechanisms that maintain contract prices close to underlying spot prices. The funding rate system automatically transfers payments between long and short position holders every eight hours, creating economic incentives for price convergence. When long positions dominate the market, funding rates typically turn positive, requiring longs to pay shorts. Conversely, excessive short positioning usually generates negative funding rates where shorts compensate longs. Current funding rates across major exchanges remain near neutral, reflecting the balanced positioning revealed in long-short ratio data. Several factors influence perpetual futures positioning beyond simple price expectations: Hedging Activity: Institutional traders often use perpetual futures to hedge spot Bitcoin holdings Leverage Preferences: Different exchanges offer varying maximum leverage levels affecting position sizing Geographic Distribution: Regional trading patterns create distinct positioning biases across platforms Market Making: Professional market makers maintain balanced books regardless of directional views Historical Context and Market Evolution Cryptocurrency derivatives markets have undergone substantial transformation since Bitcoin futures first launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the first regulated Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017, providing institutional investors with compliant exposure to cryptocurrency price movements. Subsequently, cryptocurrency-native exchanges developed perpetual futures products that gained tremendous popularity among retail and professional traders alike. Today, perpetual futures trading volume consistently exceeds spot trading volume across major cryptocurrency pairs, establishing derivatives as the dominant price discovery mechanism for digital assets. Historical long-short ratio data reveals distinct market phases. During the 2021 bull market, aggregate long positions frequently exceeded 60% across major exchanges, reflecting extreme bullish sentiment. Conversely, the 2022 bear market saw prolonged periods with short positions dominating above 55%. The current equilibrium around 50% represents a maturing market where participants exhibit more measured positioning. This development suggests increasing sophistication among cryptocurrency derivatives traders who now incorporate more nuanced risk management strategies. Exchange-Specific Positioning Analysis Each major cryptocurrency exchange maintains unique trader demographics and product features that influence perpetual futures positioning. Binance, as the global market leader, attracts the most diverse participant base including retail traders, institutions, and algorithmic trading firms. The platform’s near-perfect 50.02%/49.98% long-short split reflects this diversity, with opposing views effectively canceling each other out. Binance also offers the widest range of cryptocurrency perpetual futures products, allowing traders to express views across multiple digital assets beyond Bitcoin. OKX has historically maintained stronger retail trader participation in Asian markets, particularly throughout China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. The exchange’s 50.07%/49.93% ratio indicates slightly more bullish sentiment among this demographic, possibly reflecting regional economic conditions or local regulatory developments. OKX also pioneered several innovative derivatives features including unified margin accounts and portfolio margin systems that influence position management approaches. Bybit demonstrates the most pronounced long bias at 50.16%/49.84%, suggesting its user base maintains moderately optimistic Bitcoin price expectations. The exchange has cultivated strong popularity among retail derivatives traders through user-friendly interfaces, competitive fee structures, and extensive educational resources. Bybit’s consistent long bias throughout 2024 and early 2025 aligns with its marketing positioning as a platform for bullish cryptocurrency traders seeking leveraged exposure. Implications for Bitcoin Price Action Balanced perpetual futures positioning typically correlates with reduced short-term volatility as opposing forces create market stability. When extreme long or short positioning develops, markets become vulnerable to liquidation cascades where rapidly moving prices trigger automatic position closures. These liquidation events often accelerate price movements in the dominant direction, creating volatility spikes. The current equilibrium suggests reduced near-term liquidation risk, potentially supporting more orderly price discovery processes. Market structure analysis reveals additional insights when combining long-short ratio data with other metrics. Open interest, representing the total value of outstanding perpetual futures contracts, has remained stable throughout the reporting period. Funding rates across all three exchanges hover near 0.01% per eight-hour period, indicating neither longs nor shorts face significant carrying costs. Combined, these signals suggest a market in technical equilibrium where neither bulls nor bears possess clear advantage. Methodological Considerations in Ratio Calculation Long-short ratio calculations employ different methodologies across data providers, creating potential interpretation challenges. Some platforms calculate ratios based on position count, while others use position value or trader count. The data presented here utilizes position value methodology, measuring the notional value of long versus short positions. This approach provides the most accurate representation of capital allocation and market exposure. Several important limitations affect long-short ratio interpretation: Hidden Positions: Some institutional traders utilize multiple accounts or platforms obscuring true exposure Cross-Exchange Hedging: Sophisticated traders maintain offsetting positions across different venues Market Maker Activity: Liquidity providers typically maintain market-neutral books regardless of personal views Timeframe Discrepancies: Ratios represent snapshots rather than continuous measurements Despite these limitations, perpetual futures long-short ratios remain among the most widely monitored cryptocurrency market indicators. Trading platforms, analysts, and media outlets consistently reference this data when assessing market sentiment and potential price direction. The metric’s popularity stems from its simplicity, transparency, and real-time availability across multiple data providers. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio reveals a cryptocurrency derivatives market in remarkable equilibrium during the latest reporting period. With aggregate positioning nearly perfectly balanced at 49.85% long versus 50.15% short, traders appear divided on Bitcoin’s immediate direction despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Exchange-specific variations show subtle differences, with Bybit maintaining the strongest long bias at 50.16% while Binance exhibits near-perfect balance at 50.02% long. This balanced BTC perpetual futures positioning suggests reduced near-term volatility risk as opposing market forces create stability. Market participants will continue monitoring these ratios alongside funding rates and open interest for signals of developing directional biases in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio measure? The ratio measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specified exchanges. It provides insight into trader sentiment and potential price direction biases within derivatives markets. Q2: Why do long-short ratios differ across cryptocurrency exchanges? Ratios vary due to differences in trader demographics, geographic distribution, leverage offerings, and product features across platforms. Each exchange attracts distinct user bases with varying risk appetites and trading strategies. Q3: How does the long-short ratio relate to Bitcoin’s spot price movements? While not perfectly predictive, extreme positioning (above 55% either direction) often precedes increased volatility as liquidation cascades can accelerate price movements. Balanced ratios typically correlate with more stable price action. Q4: What time period does the long-short ratio data cover? The data represents a snapshot of open positions at a specific moment, typically updated continuously throughout trading sessions. The analysis above covers positions active during a 24-hour period ending at the reporting time. Q5: How should traders use long-short ratio information in their strategies? Sophisticated traders incorporate ratio data as one component of broader market analysis, combining it with funding rates, open interest, volume patterns, and technical indicators to assess market conditions and potential turning points.

Amid the cheers of the new year, the flagship cryptocurrency has once again retested the proven price resistance around $90,500, but the market still bears a sense of uncertainty. Related Reading: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner? Bitcoin Coinbase Premium To Rebound? In an X post on January 2, renowned analyst Burak Kesmeci shares an insightful analysis of the Bitcoin market following the asset’s positive start to 2026. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has gained by almost 4% since the new year commenced two days ago. Amid the mild market euphoria, Kesmeci highlights a simultaneous rise in Coinbase premiums across the Bitcoin and Ethereum market suggesting the recent price gains are significantly influenced by US investors. For context, the Coinbase premium assesses how much more or less US investors are paying for an asset. It is a strong market indicator as US investors’ liquidity tends to heavily influence the global market. Despite the latest price gains, Kesmeci notes that Coinbase premiums for BTC and ETH still remain negative, suggesting the majority of US investors still remain cautious. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Bitcoin Short-Term And Long-Term Triggers In predicting future price movements, Burak Kesmeci has also outlined some potential developments investors should watch out for. Using the simple moving average indicator, the market expert has identified certain price levels of importance to Bitcoin’s price trajectory. For a bullish trend to kick off in the short-term, Kesmeci explains that Bitcoin must maintain its current 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) above the present level at $89,415 for at least the next two days. Notably, a potential loss of this price level would suggest the present consolidation continues. Meanwhile, the seasoned analyst also expects a positive long-term trend to only develop when Bitcoin crosses above $101,000, which represents an intersection between the SMA365 and SMA111. This outlook underscores $101,000 as a major psychological and structural resistance, with a decisive break above it likely to restore Bitcoin’s bullish market structure after the extended correction observed in Q4 2025. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $89,520 following a 0.85% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 11471%, representing buoyant market activity. Notably, Bitcoin’s market cap has climbed to $1.79 trillion, allowing the maiden cryptocurrency account for 58.6% of the total crypto market cap.

The surge in bearish bets shows traders are bracing for losses after a fast jump in the stock that followed a $6 billion deal tied to energy and artificial intelligence. Shares of Trump Media climbed more than 30% after December 18, when the company said it would merge with Google-backed TAE Technologies in an all-stock transaction. The stock ran even harder right after the news, jumping as much as 63% over two trading days. Since Cryptopolitan reported the announcement, short interest has jumped 31% to nearly 16 million shares, close to the highest level seen since October. After the stock rose another 4% on Friday to $13.77, those short positions were worth about $218 million in bets that the price would fall, according to data from Yahoo Finance. Short sellers stack bets after merger sends Trump Media shares higher Trump Media is still losing money, and its shares are down almost 60% over the past 12 months even after the recent pop. Right now, President Donald Trump owns 115 million shares, about 40% of the company, but after the merger closes, his stake would drop to roughly 20%. Short interest near 16 million shares puts bearish positioning near levels last seen in October. The build came as the stock stayed volatile following the announcement. With the price still well below where it traded a year ago, some investors are betting the recent gains will not hold as the market absorbs the scale of the deal and the company’s ongoing losses. Trump Media’s token plan increases exposure as America goes pro-crypto At the same time, Trump Media said earlier this week it plans to issue a new token to shareholders, giving one token for each share held through a partnership with Crypto.com, and the token will operate on the Cronos blockchain. Trump later said on Truth that the token holders could receive rewards tied to its products. Chief executive Devin Nunes called the rollout “a first-of-its-kind token distribution” that will “reward Trump Media shareholders, and promote honest and open markets.” Devin also serves at the White House as chair of the Intelligence Advisory Board, where he advises the president on intelligence matters. The company said the tokens would be issued “in the near future.” Founded in 2021, Trump Media has expanded its push into crypto while also moving into artificial intelligence and financial services. Despite that expansion, its shares have fallen more than 60% this year. The crypto plan adds to Trump-linked ventures that have already generated hundreds of millions of dollars and allegations of conflicts of interest from Democrats in Congress and even some Republicans. Since returning to the White House in January, Donald has backed looser rules for crypto trading platforms and related businesses. The industry spent millions during the 2024 election cycle, backing candidates including him. Over the summer, he signed the country’s first major national crypto law, a step that folded crypto deeper into the financial system. Still, investor appetite has cooled this year as traders pulled away from volatile bets. Bitcoin is on track for an annual loss after sliding from record highs set in October. Some Trump-linked bets have stumbled too. The TRUMP meme coin surged ahead of the January inauguration and quickly ranked among the most valuable tokens. Since then, it has lost more than 90% of its value.

BTC Price Prediction and Why Investors Are Turning to This New Crypto Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-bottom-in-btc-price-prediction-and-why-investors-are-turning-to-this-new-crypto-instead/,cryptopolitan,"Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be holding steady, forming a new bottom, but whether it is merely taking a breather before resuming a downtrend is a matter of debate among analysts. Against this backdrop, investors are beginning to weigh the merits of potential up-and-coming cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently in Presale Stage 7 at the price of $0.04, is expected to present potential returns of even up to 1000% to those who join the presale today. This new crypto is attracting attention duet to its utility. The project’s presale, coupled with a lending and borrowing platform, planned multichain expansion, and the availability of convenient means of buying MUTM tokens using credit cards, may ultimately facilitate a 10x growth. When compared to the current state of Bitcoin (BTC) whose potential is limited by the sheer size of its market cap, MUTM presents a scenario where early buyers may enjoy more rapid appreciation prospects. For investors searching for the next big opportunity, this crypto to buy now offers compelling early-stage potential. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck below $91K, although technical levels indicate budding break-out momentum. The charts are tightening, MACD just turned green, and prices have held all three short-term averages while testing above the mid-band of Bollinger Bands, suggesting a market that is range-bound and not crashing. Additionally, resistance at $85K appears steadfast, and a clean close above $91K would provide a strong break-out. Until then, BTC is range-bound, underlining that trading in established markets remains difficult and that large gains prove tough in mature markets. Meanwhile, breakout investment opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly taking over the market. Mutuum Finance Is Still Early at $0.04 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in a position that could be considered in an early valuation stage in its ongoing presale. Being priced at $0.04 with a projected launch price of $0.06, smart buyers are getting in prior to the public who are waiting for launch. The project has managed to raise more than $19.52 million in the first 7 stages of presale, where more than 18,650 investors have participated. The current pricing is being regarded as early, since MUTM will launch at $0.06. This means stage 7 buyers get to benefit from a near 2x rise by the time of launch. In addition, the platform’s features support the potential for at least another 20x rise after market debut. This puts MUTM among this cycle’s most anticipated DeFi launches. While Bitcoin’s rally is limited by its huge market cap, MUTM offers untapped growth potential and smart investors are recognizing this opportunity. Passive Income for Users One of the major aspects of Mutuum Finance is the mtToken model, which encourages users to lend their assets by offering them incentives. While conventional assets can only earn interest when withdrawn, the mtTokens offered by Mutuum Finance guarantee the investors the chance to earn profits instantly while still having liquidity at their disposal. This has made MUTM the top crypto to buy now and a must-hold in 2026. Halborn Security Audit & Testnet Launch One of the most recent developments for the project was to have their lending and borrowing contracts reviewed independently by Halborn Security. The audit suggestions have been incorporated, and preparations are underway for Mutuum Finance V1 to debut on the Sepolia testnet, which will mark the first time it goes public. Some features that will be included in the testnet are: Liquidity Pools for Lending & Borrowing mtTokens signifying deposits and accumulated yields of users Debt tokens representing borrowed positions Automated liquidator bot for the management of under-collateralized loans At first, the ETH and USDT tokens will be the main assets to lend, borrow, and use as collateral within the system. More assets will be included later, with MUTM set for multichain integration. The testnet enables users to engage with the system and provide feedback to optimize the system before the mainnet launch. As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates below $91K, offering little upside in an established market, the chance presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in its early stage, is an uncommon occurrence. At the price of $0.04 during Presale Phase 7, with only $2,500 in, 62,500 MUTM tokens can be acquired, which can grow after presale to as much as $62,500, considering MUTM fetches $1 per piece. That’s a 25x ROI without having to lift a finger. Already, more than 18,650 investors are on board, and the project has raked in $19.52M, along with an exemplary mtToken model set to churn out passive income, offering realistic utility alongside the possibility for explosive growth.

The total losses resulting from wallet drainer phishing attacks reached $83.85 million, affecting 106,106 victims worldwide. According to Scan Sniffer’s 2025 phishing report, there was an 83% drop in stolen funds and a 68% reduction in victims compared with 2024, when phishing scams drained nearly half a billion dollars from more than 330,000 users. The Web3 security group said the reduction was likely a result of the mixed bullish and bearish market cycles last year, where phishing activity went up at peak market performances and fell when user engagement on blockchain networks dropped. Crypto market valuation declines ‘sends away’ phishing scammers Per Scam Sniffer’s analysis and chart data tracking the first quarter, when markets were declining, losses stood at $21.94 million, affecting slightly over 22,000 victims. When markets began to recover in the second quarter, phishing losses declined to $17.78 million from about 21,000 victims. Phishing losses and victims by month. Source: Scam Sniffer. The third quarter was the most dangerous period for market participants because several assets had witnessed strong rallies, including Bitcoin, which peaked at $123,000, and Ethereum, which hit its all-time-high price at $4,946 in August. The price charge and bull market environment came with a surge in phishing activity, pushing losses to $31.04 million and impacting 40,000 victims. August and September alone accounted for 29% of total annual losses, making the quarter the most active for attackers. However, the last quarter of the year saw a pullback in phishing losses that fell to $13.09 million, by far the quietest part of 2025. Permit / Permit2 leads signature phishing theft methods The biggest single phishing theft last year resulted in a $6.5 million loss in September, where hackers made away with staked ether and wrapped bitcoin derivatives. The attackers used a method known as the Permit-style signature, a feat that made up 38% of losses among cases exceeding $1 million. Permit/Permit 2 signatures allow token spending approvals without direct transfers, which attackers take advantage of by disguising malicious permissions to appear as legitimate prompts and trick token holders into accepting them without question. Other cases included a $3.13 million theft of wrapped Bitcoin in May using an approval escalation technique, and a $3.05 million loss of stablecoins in August through a direct transfer exploit. Yet, only 11 cases exceeded $1 million in the year, down from 30 the year before. The data also showed a decline in the average loss per victim, which fell to $790, down from nearly $1,500 last year. While the report focused on signature-based wallet drainer attacks, one of the most unforgettable cases occurred in February, when the Lazarus Group compromised a developer machine through a multisignature wallet provider within the Bybit crypto exchange. A malicious code was injected into a signing interface, enabling attackers to spoof legitimate approvals and steal approximately $1.46 billion. Supply chain attacks were also among the most prevalent methods used, with attackers stealing developer credentials through phishing emails and injecting malicious code into open-source packages, backdooring hundreds of software libraries, and exfiltrating private information and security credentials. Other campaigns phishing hackers used included compromised front-end interfaces, hijacked social media accounts, and spreading malware to steal private keys and authentication data. 2025 closed with Google Task notification phishing abuse In other news, the year ended with a sophisticated email phishing campaign in December, as hackers targeted more than 3,000 organizations in manufacturing by abusing Google’s cloud-based infrastructure. Several users reported receiving emails that appeared as genuine task notifications, prompting recipients to complete an urgent “All Employees Task.” Victims who clicked buttons labeled “View task” or “Mark complete” were redirected to malicious pages hosted on trusted cloud storage services. Because the messages were sent using legitimate application integration tools, they passed all major email authentication checks and walked past security gateways undetected.

At the same time, a separate BTC USDT chart comparison circulating on X argues Bitcoin now trades in a consolidation zone that resembles the late 2021 structure before the next leg higher. Long term Bitcoin holders pause selling after months of distribution Long term Bitcoin holders appear to have eased selling pressure for the first time since July 2025, based on a CryptoQuant chart shared on X by Merlijn The Trader. The chart tracks a 30 day sum of long term holder supply change, alongside Bitcoin’s price and the long term holder supply line. After months of mostly red bars, the latest readings move closer to neutral, which signals less net distribution than earlier in the period. Long term holder supply change 30 day sum. Source: CryptoQuant,Merlijn The Trader The histogram shows two clear regimes across 2025. First, green bars dominated into late June and early July, which points to net growth in long term holder supply during that stretch. Then, the chart flips into persistent red bars from mid July onward, indicating sustained net reductions as older coins moved out of long term holder status, sold, or transferred. Meanwhile, the long term holder supply line trends lower through the second half of the year, matching the extended red phase. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price line swings through several peaks and pullbacks, including a sharp drop around late November. Even so, the selling signal in the long term holder metric looks to be fading near year end as the red bars shrink. That shift matters because long term holder behavior often acts as a supply side filter. When long term holders sell, they add inventory to the market and can cap rebounds. However, when they slow distribution, the market can absorb fewer coins from that cohort, so price becomes more sensitive to changes in demand from spot buyers and derivatives positioning. Still, this metric alone does not confirm direction, since macro moves, liquidity, and short term holder activity can override the signal in the near term. Bitcoin chart highlights late 2021 style consolidation A Bitcoin price chart shared on X compares the 2024–2026 BTC USDT structure with the 2020–2022 cycle, focusing on a sideways phase near a key horizontal level. The post came from Vivek Sen, who argued the setup supports a move toward $280,000. Bitcoin USDT cycle comparison chart 2024–2026 and 2020–2022. Source: Vivek Sen In the 2024–2026 panel, Bitcoin climbs, then trades in a tight range around the marked support line, with the chart labeling the consolidation area as November 2025. The earlier part of the move shows a downtrend break and recovery into the current range, which frames the market as holding above a reclaimed level rather than extending in a straight line. In the 2020–2022 panel, the chart marks a similar pause around November 2021 after an advance, followed by a strong continuation higher. The comparison implies the market can spend time building a base near prior resistance before the next leg. The chart also includes a dashed path projecting higher into 2026. However, it provides no timing signals or triggers beyond the idea that price needs to hold the highlighted zone. As a result, the takeaway is structural: Bitcoin sits in consolidation near support, and the bullish projection depends on that base staying intact while demand returns.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

According to reports, the attackers have been draining wallets years after encrypted vaults were stolen and laundering the digital assets through Russian exchanges. In 2022, LastPass confirmed that attackers had breached its systems by compromising a developer environment. The platform added that the criminals stole portions of the company’s source code and proprietary technical information. In another related incident, the hackers used the stolen credentials to breach the GoTo cloud storage firm, stealing LastPass database backups stored on the platform. For some users, the vault contained both stored credentials and cryptocurrency wallet private keys and seed phrases. Cryptocurrency theft attacks linked to LastPass breach During the breach, LastPass claimed that its vaults were encrypted. However, users with weak or reused master passwords were vulnerable to offline cracking, which TRM Labs believes has been ongoing since the breach occurred. “Depending on the length and complexity of your master password and iteration count setting, you may want to reset your master password,” warned LastPass when they disclosed the breach. The link between the LastPass breaches and the cryptocurrency thefts was also confirmed by the United States Secret Service last year after the agency seized more than $23 million in crypto and said the attackers had obtained the private keys of their victims by decrypting vault data stolen in a password manager breach. Court filings also mentioned that there was no evidence that the victims’ devices had been compromised through malware or phishing. In its report, TRM Labs connected the ongoing crypto theft to the abuse of the encrypted LastPass vaults stolen in 2022. Rather than the hackers moving swiftly to drain the entire wallets after the breach, the thefts have been carried out in waves, months or years after the incident occurred. It also shows that attackers have been gradually decrypting vaults and extracting stored credentials. In addition, the wallets were drained using similar transaction methods. TRM Labs also mentioned that the method used during the breach showed that the hackers possessed the private keys before the thefts. “The linkage in the report is not based on direct attribution to individual LastPass accounts, but on correlating downstream on-chain activity with the known impact pattern of the 2022 breach,” TRM said. The platform noted that it created a scenario in which the wallet occurs in the future, rather than immediately after the breach happened. TRM Labs highlights the use of Wasabi’s CoinJoin feature The platform also mentioned that its research was initially based on a small number of reports, including several submissions made to Chainabuse, where users identified the LastPass breach as the method the hackers used to steal their wallets. The researchers increased their investigation, identifying cryptocurrency transaction behavior across other cases, eventually linking it to the data theft campaign. TRM also added that it was able to trace funds even after the attackers mixed them using Wasabi wallet’s CoinJoin feature. CoinJoin is a Bitcoin privacy technique that includes all transactions from multiple users into a single transaction, making it harder to determine which input corresponds to which output. The feature obfuscates transactions without using a traditional mixing service. After draining wallets , the hackers usually convert stolen assets to Bitcoin, route them through Wasabi Wallet, and attempt to hide their tracks using the feature. However, TRM mentioned that it was able to demix the Bitcoin sent using the CoinJoin feature by analyzing behavioral characteristics, such as transaction structure, timing, and wallet configuration choices. It was also able to match deposits with withdrawal patterns that matched the crypto theft.

This comprehensive analysis examines BTC’s potential price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, incorporating historical patterns, technological developments, and macroeconomic factors that could influence the world’s premier cryptocurrency. Market analysts particularly focus on post-halving cycles and increasing mainstream integration. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Professional analysts employ multiple methodologies when forecasting Bitcoin’s future value. Quantitative models often reference stock-to-flow ratios, network effect metrics, and adoption curve projections. Historical data reveals Bitcoin has experienced four-year cycles typically aligned with halving events. The 2024 halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, creating predictable supply constraints. Furthermore, increasing institutional participation through spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced new capital flows. Traditional financial institutions now allocate portions of portfolios to digital assets. This institutional validation represents a significant shift from Bitcoin’s early years as a purely retail-driven asset. Technical and Fundamental Analysis Framework Analysts combine on-chain metrics with macroeconomic indicators for balanced predictions. Key metrics include: Network Hash Rate: Measures computational security and miner commitment Active Addresses: Indicates user adoption and network utility Exchange Reserves: Tracks available supply versus long-term holding patterns MVRV Ratio: Compares market value to realized value for valuation insights These indicators provide objective data points beyond speculative sentiment. The growing Lightning Network capacity additionally suggests improving scalability for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Post-Halving Momentum Analysis Historical patterns suggest 2026 could represent a period of consolidation or continued growth following the 2024 halving. Previous cycles indicate the second year post-halving often shows substantial price appreciation. However, analysts caution that past performance never guarantees future results. Several factors specifically influence 2026 projections: Factor Potential Impact Evidence Source Institutional ETF Flows Continued capital inflow SEC regulatory approvals Global Regulatory Clarity Reduced uncertainty premium MiCA implementation in EU Technological Scaling Improved utility and adoption Taproot adoption metrics Market observers note that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional assets has fluctuated. During periods of monetary policy uncertainty, Bitcoin sometimes behaves as a risk-off asset. This evolving relationship complicates straightforward predictions. Central bank digital currency developments may also influence Bitcoin’s perceived role in the global financial system. BTC 2030 Forecast: Long-Term Value Proposition Projecting to 2030 requires examining Bitcoin’s fundamental value drivers. The fixed supply of 21 million coins creates predictable scarcity. By 2030, approximately 98% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. This diminishing new supply coincides with potential increased demand scenarios. Several adoption trajectories could materialize: Store of Value Narrative: Continued adoption as digital gold Medium of Exchange Development: Improved scalability enabling transactions Institutional Infrastructure: Integration with traditional finance deepening Demographic trends favor increased cryptocurrency adoption. Younger generations show greater comfort with digital assets. Technological improvements in custody solutions and user interfaces could lower barriers to entry. However, regulatory developments across major economies will significantly influence adoption rates. International coordination efforts through organizations like the Financial Stability Board may establish clearer global standards. Expert Perspectives and Model Variations Financial institutions have published varied Bitcoin price predictions for 2030. These projections typically range from conservative to optimistic based on different adoption scenarios. Goldman Sachs analysts emphasize Bitcoin’s volatility but acknowledge its growing institutional acceptance. Meanwhile, Fidelity Investments researchers highlight Bitcoin’s unique characteristics as an uncorrelated asset. Academic institutions like MIT and Stanford regularly publish blockchain research that informs these forecasts. It’s crucial to understand that all long-term predictions involve significant uncertainty. Market participants should consider multiple scenarios rather than single price targets. Critical Market Factors Influencing Future Bitcoin Valuation Several interconnected elements will determine Bitcoin’s price trajectory through 2030. Monetary policy decisions by major central banks significantly impact all risk assets. Interest rate environments influence the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Geopolitical developments affecting currency stability may increase demand for decentralized alternatives. Technological advancements in competing blockchain networks could affect Bitcoin’s market dominance. Environmental concerns regarding energy consumption continue prompting innovation in mining sustainability. The transition toward renewable energy sources for mining operations may address these concerns. Additionally, security developments protecting against quantum computing threats remain an ongoing research priority for the Bitcoin development community. Comparative Asset Analysis Bitcoin increasingly competes with traditional stores of value. Gold maintains a market capitalization exceeding $13 trillion, while Bitcoin’s market capitalization fluctuates around $1 trillion. This comparison suggests substantial growth potential if Bitcoin captures even a portion of gold’s market. Real estate and bond markets offer alternative investment vehicles with different risk-return profiles. Bitcoin’s 24/7 market operation provides unique liquidity advantages over traditional assets with limited trading hours. However, this constant availability also contributes to volatility. The evolving regulatory treatment of Bitcoin as either a commodity or security will affect its investment characteristics and tax treatment across jurisdictions. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 involve analyzing complex technological, economic, and regulatory factors. While historical patterns and quantitative models provide frameworks, unexpected developments frequently disrupt financial markets. The Bitcoin price prediction landscape requires continuous monitoring of on-chain metrics, institutional adoption rates, and global macroeconomic conditions. Investors should maintain balanced perspectives, recognizing both Bitcoin’s transformative potential and its inherent volatility. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, Bitcoin’s role within global finance will likely continue evolving alongside technological advancements and regulatory developments. FAQs Q1: What is the most reliable method for Bitcoin price prediction? Analysts typically combine multiple methodologies including technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and fundamental factors. No single method proves completely reliable, so consensus among varied approaches provides the most balanced outlook. Q2: How does Bitcoin halving affect long-term price predictions? Halving events reduce new Bitcoin supply by 50% approximately every four years. Historical data shows these events have preceded substantial price increases, though each cycle exhibits unique characteristics influenced by broader market conditions. Q3: What percentage of institutional portfolios currently includes Bitcoin? Allocations remain small but growing. Recent surveys indicate between 1-5% of portfolio allocations among crypto-adopting institutions, with many traditional firms still in exploratory phases regarding digital asset integration. Q4: How do regulatory developments impact Bitcoin price predictions? Clear regulatory frameworks typically reduce uncertainty premiums and may increase institutional participation. However, restrictive regulations in major economies could limit adoption rates and affect price trajectories significantly. Q5: What technological developments could most influence Bitcoin’s price by 2030? Scalability solutions like the Lightning Network, improved privacy features, quantum-resistant cryptography, and enhanced smart contract capabilities through layers could substantially increase Bitcoin’s utility and adoption.

The Hong Kong tech company has already acquired various mining hardware from Bitmain to mine Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Its mining fleet comprises Antminer S21 XP Hydro units, S21 XP air-cooled miners, and Antminer L9 machines, which are expected to provide 30 PH/s for Bitcoin and 0.5 TH/s for Litecoin and Dogecoin. All installations are expected to be completed by the end of this month. It also secured 0.5 megawatts of power capacity across several US data centers . Not to mention, the firm is preparing to scale into broader digital assets activities, including future staking and node services, describing the start of its mining operation as a launchpad for its future services. BitVentures plans to expand crypto operations in the years to come BitVentures expects full mining deployment in the first quarter, targeting Bitcoin and select altcoins while prioritizing efficient, high-end machines to manage market fluctuations. Lawrence Wai Lok, CEO of the company, has described the rollout as a proof-of-concept phase, adding that the company will gradually expand its operations over time. He commented, “Subject to ongoing market conditions, the company intends to continue to invest in digital assets, and methodically scale its operations in tranches, creating a foundation for future expansion into broader digital asset services, including potential staking, node operations, and ecosystem partnerships.” He added, “We believe that establishing an efficient mining footprint may position the company favorably to pursue broader opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem.” Previously, BitVentures was formerly known as Santech Holdings and was listed on Nasdaq as STEC. The name change and ticker symbol change to BVC took effect on December 24. Before then, Santech’s core business had focused on technology investments, e-commerce platforms, and consumer-facing digital services, with no direct ties to blockchain or cryptocurrency. The firm had noted in its rebranding filing, “The company believes that the new name aligns well with its vision and focus on developing and investing in early-stage technology ventures.” Before switching to the Santech name, it was Hywin Wealth, a leading independent wealth management firm in China and a major player in real estate investment products. Over the past few months, several listed companies — including BitVentures — have turned to digital assets, raising crypto exposure as a potential remedy for business slowdowns and falling valuations. Last summer, biotech company 180 Life Sciences switched to an Ethereum treasury strategy after its shares had lost around 99% of their value. Corporations across all sectors, from non-bank lending to consumer products and agri-tech, have turned their attention to digital asset treasury strategies, such as those employed by Mill City Ventures, Upexi, and Nature’s Miracle. BitVentures shares surged 8% after it revealed its plans BitVentures’ stock has tumbled, with total returns since its IPO at approximately -89%, according to reports, a factor that may explain the company’s pivot. Stepping away from its wealth and asset management divisions resulted in the company generating no revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025. Nonetheless, BitVentures’ stock recorded a significant 8%+ increase in intraday trading after the firm announced its strategic move into the digital assets space, indicating a notable shift in its business strategy. The surge in share price came as investors increasingly bought into the company’s new bets in the cryptocurrency mining and broader blockchain-related services category — a portion of the tech industry that many investors see as high-growth, high-demand, and promising in the future.

Buyers continue to defend the $88,000–$88,500 zone, while momentum remains restrained. Technical structure points to compression, not weakness, with higher lows, stabilizing indicators, and cautious sentiment shaping the outlook. Whether Bitcoin breaks above $90,500 or revisits lower support will likely set the tone for its next major move. Why Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Is Continuing to Defy the Odds Recent price action points to a clear stalemate. December’s volatility may have grabbed headlines, but Bitcoin has since settled into a tighter range, forming higher lows while struggling to reclaim the upper $90,000s. #Bitcoin is starting 2026 at a crossroads. #BTC holds near $89.7K as buyers defend $88K support, volatility compresses, and RSI stabilizes. A break above $90.5K could unlock the next leg higher — or delay the move. pic.twitter.com/i4JltTfeYW — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) January 3, 2026 This price behavior reflects consolidation rather than weakness, at least based on current market data. After a turbulent December, profit-taking has cooled, while long-term holders appear comfortable maintaining exposure rather than rushing for the exit. Candlestick behavior supports this interpretation. Smaller candle bodies and shorter wicks suggest neither buyers nor sellers are pressing aggressively. There are no clear signs of bearish follow-through or panic-driven selling, reinforcing the view that the market is pausing rather than breaking down. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis: What’s the End Game? On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish after the breakout of remains a symmetrical triangle pattern which was defined by lower highs near $93,500 and a rising base between $85,800 and $87,000. This pattern typically signals compression and often precedes a volatility expansion rather than a sustained decline. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview So what is the current technical setup telling us? The constructive takeaway is that key indicators continue to lean supportive: Bitcoin is still printing higher lows along an ascending trendline drawn from mid-December, reinforcing underlying demand. The 50-day and 100-day EMAs are flattening and clustering around the $88,500–$89,000 area, creating a near-term support cushion. RSI has stabilized in the low-to-mid 60s, indicating improving momentum without entering overheated territory. There is no bearish divergence or negative EMA crossover in place, keeping downside risk contained for now. Market Data Adds to the Picture Looking beyond the charts, broader market metrics reinforce the technical setup. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization has rebounded toward $3 trillion, while 24-hour trading volume sits near $116 billion. That combination points to active participation without the kind of excess typically seen near market tops. Sentiment indicators also remain measured. The Fear and Greed Index continues to signal caution, reflecting lingering uncertainty rather than speculative euphoria, an environment that often leaves room for upside if price breaks key technical levels. What to Expect from Bitcoin in the Coming Weeks From a 2-hour chart perspective, a confirmed close above the $90,500–$90,900 zone would likely open the door to a push toward $93,500, with scope to extend into the $96,000–$97,000 area if momentum builds. Conversely, a failure to hold the upper $80,000s would weaken the structure and bring the $85,800 support level back into focus. At this stage, the price action looks more like preparation than exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin continues to defend the high $80,000s, the underlying bias remains constructive. A decisive breakout could shift sentiment quickly and potentially mark the start of the market’s next advance as the broader crypto cycle moves into a new phase. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

56765916,652135,1767434450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56765916.jpeg,Michael Saylor’s Strategy Anticipated To Disclose ‘Multibillion-Dollar’ Loss In Q4 Report,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-to-disclose-multibillion-dollar-loss/,bitcoinist,"Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is poised for one of its toughest year-end closings to date, as Bitcoin (BTC) prices have retraced below the $90,000 mark from highs exceeding $126,000. This downturn is expected to culminate in a multibillion-dollar loss when the firm releases its fourth-quarter financial results. Strategy’s Earnings Expected To Plunge According to reports from Bloomberg, Strategy is likely to announce substantial losses that represent a stark contrast to the $2.8 billion profit recorded in the previous third-quarter of the last year. Aaron Jacob, an associate professor at Brigham Young University and a senior adviser at Taxbit, noted the significance of this shift, stating, “There was this one-time pop, but that is a different story in this quarter. It is going to be a sizable loss.” The root of this anticipated loss can be traced back to an accounting change implemented in the first quarter of the year, requiring the company to value its cryptocurrency assets at current market prices. Given that Bitcoin tumbled 24% during the fourth quarter, the impact of this decision is now becoming evident. Following a period of strong performance against benchmark stock indices, the company’s shares have fallen nearly 48% throughout 2025, down to its current trading price of $156. Saylor’s Wealth Plummets 40% Concerns have also emerged that Strategy may need to sell portions of its Bitcoin holdings to cover mounting expenses, including dividends and interest payments. To mitigate these apprehensions, Strategy established a cash reserve on December 1 by selling common shares. Strategy also revised its full-year earnings guidance at the beginning of last month. The company is operating under the assumption that Bitcoin will range between $85,000 and $110,000 by year-end. Based on these projections, it anticipated operating income could range from a loss of $7 billion to a profit of $9.5 billion. However, with Bitcoin finishing the year down 6.5%, the likelihood leans toward a loss closer to the lower end of that spectrum. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the company’s co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylor , has also suffered a dramatic drop in personal wealth during this downturn, with his fortune falling by around 40% to approximately $3.8 billion. Market-To-Net Asset Value Drops To Critical Levels As if to compound the company’s challenges, Strategy now faces a potential decline in investor confidence. The enterprise value of the firm is nearing a level that could fall below the value of its Bitcoin holdings for the first time in over two years. Current data suggests the company’s enterprise value—including its debts and the total notional value of its perpetual preferred stock—stands at approximately $61 billion. With shares down nearly 70% from the record high reached in November 2024, the company’s market-to-net asset value (mNAV)—a ratio comparing market capitalization and debt to token holdings—has dropped to just above 1.

Bitfinex Hack Mastermind Receives Early Release On Friday, Ilya Lichtenstein, the mastermind behind the 2016 hack that stole over 120,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from crypto exchange Bitfinex, announced that he had been released from prison a year after receiving a five-year sentence . On X, Lichtenstein thanked a law signed by President Trump during his first administration for his release. “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early,” the post stated. Notably, Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act on December 21, 2018, aiming to improve criminal justice outcomes and reduce the size of the federal prison population. The law included a series of reforms, including one to establish a “risk and needs assessment system” that offers some inmates rehabilitative programming and the opportunity to be released early into home confinement. According to CNBC, A Trump administration official stated on January 2 that the mastermind behind the Bitfinex hack “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” The US Department of Justice (DOJ) previously declared that Lichtenstein used advanced hacking techniques and tools to access Bitfinex’s network. He then transferred 119,574 Bitcoin to one of his crypto wallets through more than 2,000 transactions. At the time, the stolen funds were valued at around $71 million. However, its value has increased exponentially in the past decade, being worth nearly $11 billion at current prices. During his sentencing hearing, he expressed remorse for using his talents on criminal activities “instead of a positive contribution to society.” “I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,” Lichtenstein affirmed on his Friday announcement, thanking his supporters for the help and vowing to prove “the haters” wrong. Crypto Heist Figures Reunite Under Trump’s Law Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, reacted to the news online, declaring that being reunited at home with her husband after four years was “the best New Year’s present” she could get. Morgan, a rapper known online as “Razzlekhan,” entered prison in February 2025 but was released early from prison after eight months under the First Step Act. In late October, she posted a video on X, sharing the news and thanking President Trump for her release. “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter,” she stated . However, it appears that the US President was not directly involved in the decision. As reported by Bitcoinist, the self-titled “Crocodile of Wall Street” was sentenced to 18 months in prison on November 18, 2024, for her role in the Bitfinex heist. Despite not being involved in the hack, Morgan assisted her husband in laundering the stolen funds by using “numerous sophisticated laundering techniques” to disguise them. Notably, they used fake identities to create online accounts, deposited the stolen Bitcoin in several darknet markets and crypto exchanges to withdraw the funds, converted BTC to other cryptocurrencies, and deposited part of the funds into crypto mixers. The couple seemingly managed to launder 21% of the total funds stolen from Bitfinex. At the time, prosecutors argued that Morgan was “a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions.” Nonetheless, they noted that she was “a lower-level participant,” which resulted in her reduced sentence.",Crypto News|2016 Bitfinex Hack|bitcoin|Bitcoin Heist|Bitfinex exchange|Bitfinex Hacker|btc|BTCUSDFT|crypto hacker|Crypto heist|heather Morgan|Ilya Lichtenstein|US President Donald Trump,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,0,0,EN,"{

This sudden downturn followed breaking news reports of a targeted U.S. military airstrike in Venezuela, immediately highlighting the digital asset’s ongoing sensitivity to real-world geopolitical shocks. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing whether this represents a fleeting reaction or the start of a deeper correction amidst a complex macroeconomic landscape. Bitcoin Price Reacts to Sudden Geopolitical Shock According to data from major exchanges and reported by Cointelegraph, the leading cryptocurrency reversed from an intraday high near $90,940. The sell-off accelerated rapidly as news wires confirmed the Venezuelan incident. Market depth charts showed significant short-term selling pressure materializing in the wake of the headlines. This event provides a stark, real-time case study in market microstructure. High-frequency traders and algorithmic systems often execute pre-programmed risk-off protocols during such events. Historically, Bitcoin and other crypto assets have demonstrated pronounced volatility during geopolitical crises. For instance, the initial phases of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict saw similar sharp declines followed by a vigorous recovery. The current situation mirrors that pattern, where initial fear-driven selling gives way to more nuanced trading based on the conflict’s perceived duration and global economic impact. Market participants are now closely monitoring official statements from Washington D.C. and Caracas for further clues. Analyst Consensus and Short-Term Market Pressure Many prominent market analysts believe the Bitcoin price drop will likely prove temporary, contingent on the situation not escalating into a broader regional conflict. “Geopolitical events often create knee-jerk liquidity crunches in digital asset markets,” noted a strategist from a major crypto investment firm. “The underlying network fundamentals for Bitcoin remain unchanged. However, if the situation stabilizes, we typically see a retracement of the initial panic move.” This perspective is supported by on-chain data, which showed no corresponding spike in long-term holder distribution during the sell-off. Evidence from Derivatives and On-Chain Metrics Data from derivatives markets offers further context. The funding rates for Bitcoin perpetual swaps turned slightly negative, indicating heightened caution among leveraged traders. Meanwhile, the futures open interest declined modestly, suggesting a unwind of speculative positions rather than a fundamental exodus. The following table summarizes key market metrics before and after the news broke: Metric Pre-News (Approx.) Post-News (Approx.) BTC Spot Price $90,940 $89,850 24h Trading Volume Change +15% +85% Fear & Greed Index Greed (72) Neutral (54) BTC Dominance 52.1% 51.8% This data illustrates a classic risk-off shift. The surge in volume confirms the news was the primary catalyst, while the shift in market sentiment indices reflects a sudden reassessment of risk. The Broader Context: Capital Rotation and Macro Trends The event occurs against a fascinating macroeconomic backdrop. Notably, gold—the traditional safe-haven asset—has been correcting after recently hitting a nominal all-time high. In contrast, Bitcoin had risen approximately 5% since the Christmas holiday period. This divergent performance has fueled analyst speculation about a potential capital rotation from traditional stores of value into digital assets. The theory suggests investors may be reallocating a portion of their inflation-hedge portfolios. Several factors support this observation. First, increasing institutional adoption provides a structural bid for Bitcoin. Second, its fixed supply schedule contrasts with the continuous mining of precious metals. Finally, its digital, borderless nature offers a unique value proposition in times of regional instability. However, today’s price action serves as a crucial reminder that Bitcoin’s journey to becoming a uncorrelated safe haven remains a work in progress. Its price discovery is still heavily influenced by global liquidity conditions and investor sentiment. Historical Precedents and Market Psychology Examining past reactions provides critical insight. During the 2020 U.S.-Iran tensions, Bitcoin initially sold off before rallying strongly in the subsequent weeks. The market often processes geopolitical risk in two phases: an initial liquidity shock where all risky assets are sold, followed by a reassessment phase where assets with strong underlying theses recover. The speed of Bitcoin’s recovery this time will be a key indicator of its maturity. Long-term holders, often called ‘HODLers,’ typically view these dips as accumulation opportunities, which can create a price floor. Conclusion The sudden drop in the Bitcoin price below $90,000 following the Venezuela airstrike news underscores the cryptocurrency market’s acute sensitivity to geopolitical developments. While analysts largely view the sell-off as a temporary reaction to a risk-off shock, it vividly illustrates the asset class’s current stage of evolution. The concurrent narrative of potential capital rotation from gold to BTC adds a complex, longer-term dimension to the short-term volatility. Ultimately, the market’s response in the coming days will offer valuable evidence on Bitcoin’s resilience and its evolving role within the global financial ecosystem during periods of international tension. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall after the Venezuela airstrike news? Financial markets often react negatively to sudden geopolitical instability due to increased uncertainty. The news triggered automated and discretionary selling as investors sought to reduce risk exposure, causing a short-term liquidity shock in the cryptocurrency market. Q2: How does this reaction compare to Bitcoin’s behavior in past geopolitical crises? The pattern is consistent with previous events, such as the early 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Typically, an initial sharp sell-off on the news is followed by a period of consolidation and often a recovery, depending on the scale and duration of the crisis. Q3: What is meant by ‘capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin’? This theory suggests that some investors are moving funds out of traditional safe-haven assets like gold, which has recently corrected from highs, and into Bitcoin. The 5% rise in BTC since Christmas amidst gold’s correction is cited as preliminary evidence, though long-term trends require more data. Q4: Will the Bitcoin price drop continue? Most analysts cited believe the drop will be temporary if the Venezuela situation does not escalate significantly. Market recovery will depend on the evolution of the geopolitical event, broader macroeconomic conditions, and underlying on-chain Bitcoin network strength. Q5: What metrics should investors watch now? Key metrics include the stability of the Venezuela situation, Bitcoin’s on-chain exchange flows (to see if long-term holders are selling), derivatives market funding rates, and the price action of traditional safe havens like gold and the U.S. dollar.

Venezuelan authorities accused Washington of hitting military-linked targets and announced emergency security measures after the blasts. U.S. President Donald Trump later said Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and flown out of the country following the operation. At the time of reporting, officials did not publish a detailed briefing that confirmed targets, timing, or the claim’s operational details. Airspace warnings and flight restrictions also surfaced in early coverage. As a result, traders treated the headlines as an immediate macro risk event, even while many facts remained unsettled. Bolivar Weakness and Dollar Pricing Fueled USDT Demand Venezuela entered the latest shock with a fragile currency setup. The Venezuelan bolívar has faced repeated depreciation pressure, while many merchants price goods in U.S. dollars to avoid fast-changing local costs. USD/VES Exchange Rate Trend. Source: Trading Economics That gap creates a daily conversion problem. People often earn or hold bolívars, yet they need dollars for rent, imports, and bigger purchases, so exchange rates matter even for routine spending. In that environment, USDT has expanded as a “digital dollar” substitute for transfers and short-term savings. When cash USD gets scarce or risky to move, USDT can act as a bridge between bolívars and dollar-based pricing, including for business payments. Bitcoin Price Mirrors Israel–Iran Headline Volatility Bitcoin traded in a wide intraday range on Jan. 3, and the chart shows sharp swings instead of a one-way move. Price fell toward $88,600 in the late afternoon, then it rebounded fast and pushed above $90,500 in the evening. After that spike, Bitcoin drifted lower in choppy trading, and it later dipped again near $89,400 before stabilizing around $89,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Intraday Price Chart (Jan. 3).

56766490,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258263,1767439211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-caroline-crenshaw-resigns-crypto/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a move that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a steadfast Democratic voice for stringent cryptocurrency oversight, has announced her resignation from the agency. Her departure, first reported by DL News, removes a pivotal figure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and sparks immediate analysis about the future direction of crypto policy. Crenshaw consistently championed a strict application of securities laws to the burgeoning industry, most notably dissenting against the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Consequently, her exit introduces significant uncertainty and potential for a more industry-friendly regulatory posture from the nation’s top financial markets watchdog. Caroline Crenshaw’s Legacy as an SEC Crypto Critic President Joe Biden appointed Caroline Crenshaw to the SEC in 2020. She quickly established herself as the commission’s most vocal skeptic regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. Her regulatory philosophy centered on robust investor protection and market integrity. Crenshaw frequently argued that many digital assets constitute securities under existing law. She believed they should therefore comply with the full suite of registration and disclosure requirements. This stance often placed her at odds with industry advocates seeking new, tailored frameworks. Her tenure featured several high-profile dissents and public statements. These documents now form a clear record of her cautious approach. For instance, she voiced deep concerns about the custody, valuation, and market manipulation risks inherent in crypto markets. Furthermore, Crenshaw emphasized the potential for retail investor harm in a volatile and complex asset class. Her consistent messaging provided a counterbalance to more permissive views, both within the SEC and in the broader political arena. A Defining Moment: The Bitcoin ETF Dissent Commissioner Crenshaw’s most significant public stand occurred in January 2024. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, approved a batch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This decision marked a historic pivot after years of rejections. However, Crenshaw issued a forceful and detailed dissent. She argued the approvals failed to adequately address fundamental concerns about fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin spot markets. Crenshaw warned that the decision could expose millions of investors to substantial risks. This dissent cemented her reputation as the commission’s foremost crypto critic and highlighted the deep internal divisions on the issue. The Immediate Impact of the Resignation on Crypto Regulation Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation creates an immediate vacancy on the five-member commission. The SEC’s current composition now leans more heavily toward perspectives that may be open to engaging with the digital asset sector. However, Chair Gary Gensler remains a central figure. His own enforcement-focused approach will continue to guide the agency’s day-to-day operations. The immediate impact may be more tonal than substantive in the short term. Nevertheless, her absence removes a powerful internal voice advocating for the strictest possible interpretation of the law. The resignation process triggers a political appointment sequence. President Biden will nominate a successor, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. This process offers a key opportunity to shift the commission’s balance. Industry groups will likely lobby for a nominee with a more nuanced understanding of blockchain technology. Conversely, investor protection advocates will push for someone who maintains Crenshaw’s vigilance. The timeline for this appointment remains uncertain, creating a period of regulatory ambiguity. Potential Shifts in Pending Enforcement and Rulemaking Analysts are scrutinizing several ongoing SEC initiatives for potential change. High-profile enforcement cases against major crypto exchanges, which Crenshaw likely supported, will probably continue. However, her departure could influence the commission’s appetite for future, expansive legal theories. In terms of rulemaking, key areas to watch include: Custody Rules: Proposed changes to how investment advisers custody digital assets. Exchange Definitions: Rules that could expand the definition of an “exchange” to include DeFi platforms. Staking Services: Regulatory clarity for crypto staking and lending products. Without Crenshaw’s vote, proposals in these areas might see modifications or face closer votes, potentially leading to more industry-favorable outcomes. Historical Context and the Broader Regulatory Battle Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation occurs during a pivotal decade for financial regulation. The rise of blockchain technology has challenged decades-old legal frameworks globally. In the United States, the debate centers on whether existing securities laws, largely written in the 1930s, can effectively govern this new asset class. The SEC, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, has generally argued they can. Crenshaw was a leading proponent of this view. Her stance contrasted with other regulators, like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has sought greater authority over digital commodities. This internal SEC dynamic mirrors a larger conflict in Washington. Legislative efforts to create a comprehensive crypto framework have repeatedly stalled in Congress. In the absence of new laws, regulatory agencies like the SEC have used enforcement actions to establish boundaries. Crenshaw’s voice was crucial in shaping that enforcement-first strategy. Her exit may encourage renewed legislative negotiations, as industry players see an opening for a more collaborative regulatory partner. Expert Analysis on the Commission’s Future Direction Financial law experts emphasize that one commissioner’s departure does not instantly reverse policy. “Commissioner Crenshaw was an important intellectual force for caution,” notes a former SEC senior counsel. “Her dissents provided a roadmap for legal challenges to SEC actions perceived as too lenient. Without that voice, the internal debate may lack a certain rigor, potentially allowing for more pragmatic, though still regulated, approaches to emerge.” Other analysts point to the remaining commissioners’ public statements. They suggest a continued focus on enforcement but perhaps with more publicly stated distinctions between different types of crypto assets. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the SEC and Crypto The resignation of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw marks the end of a definitive era in U.S. cryptocurrency regulation. Her unwavering advocacy for applying traditional securities laws with full force provided a clear, if contentious, regulatory stance. Her departure introduces a new variable into an already complex equation. While immediate, sweeping changes are unlikely, the long-term trajectory of SEC policy toward digital assets may now have greater flexibility. The focus now shifts to the White House and the Senate. The appointment of her successor will send the next clear signal about whether the SEC under Chair Gensler will maintain its hardline posture or begin a cautious pivot toward a more structured engagement with the crypto industry. The legacy of Caroline Crenshaw’s tenure will be measured by how that future unfolds. FAQs Q1: Why did Caroline Crenshaw resign from the SEC? Commissioner Crenshaw has not publicly stated a specific reason for her resignation. Such departures are common at the end of a term or for personal career progression. The announcement, reported by DL News, simply confirms her decision to leave the agency. Q2: Does her resignation mean the SEC will stop suing crypto companies? No. The SEC’s enforcement division operates independently and pursues cases it believes violate securities laws. Chair Gary Gensler, who leads the agency, remains in place and has consistently supported an active enforcement stance. Crenshaw’s departure may affect the commission’s vote on certain cases but is unlikely to halt enforcement altogether. Q3: Who will replace Caroline Crenshaw on the SEC? President Biden will nominate a successor. The nominee must then be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The process could take several months. The new commissioner will likely be a Democrat, maintaining the current 3-2 partisan split, but their specific views on cryptocurrency regulation will be closely watched. Q4: How did Crenshaw vote on the spot Bitcoin ETFs? Commissioner Crenshaw dissented against the January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. She published a detailed statement arguing that the approvals did not sufficiently protect investors from fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market. Q5: Will this make it easier for other crypto ETFs (like for Ethereum) to get approved? Potentially. Crenshaw was a noted skeptic of the entire asset class. Her absence removes one likely “no” vote from the commission. However, the approval of an Ethereum ETF or similar product would still depend on the applicant meeting the SEC’s stringent requirements and the views of the remaining four commissioners, including Chair Gensler.

The chart’s highest valuation band, ‘Maximum Bubble Territory’, spans roughly $334,173.88 to $449,435.85 and is historically associated with extreme overvaluation and late-cycle market euphoria. Just below it, the ‘Sell, Seriously, SELL!’ zone ranges from about $256,680.28 to $334,173.88, signaling conditions where long-term returns have historically weakened, and downside risk increased. The ‘FOMO intensifies’ band places Bitcoin between approximately $200,285.53 and $256,680.28, reflecting periods of accelerating retail participation and momentum-driven buying. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter Below that, the ‘Is this a bubble?’ level, running from around $157,214.21 to $200,285.53, points to elevated prices that often spark debate over sustainability without necessarily marking a market peak. The ‘HODL!’ zone, spanning roughly $120,036.03 to $157,214.21, represents valuations where long-term holders have historically been inclined to maintain positions amid strong but not excessive optimism. Further down, the ‘Still cheap’ band places the cryptocurrency between about $92,914.92 and $120,036.03, implying prices that in past cycles have offered favorable long-term risk-reward. The ‘Accumulate’ zone ranges from approximately $71,943.71 to $92,914.92 and reflects levels where investors have historically increased exposure during subdued sentiment. Below that, the ‘BUY!’ category spans roughly $53,350.41 to $71,943.71, a range associated with broad undervaluation in prior cycles. At the lowest end, the ‘Basically a Fire Sale’ zone places Bitcoin between about $40,828.60 and $53,350.41, representing deep-value territory that has historically aligned with strong long-term entry points after major drawdowns. Bitcoin’s possible Jan 31 price Taken together, the Rainbow Chart does not forecast a specific Bitcoin price for January 31, 2026, but outlines sentiment-based valuation bands that frame potential upside and downside scenarios. With Bitcoin currently trading at $89,777, the chart suggests a plausible path into late January 2026, within the ‘Still cheap’ or ‘HODL!’ zones, corresponding to roughly $93,000 to $157,000 if BTC continues to follow its historical growth curve.

The story was a little different for the digital asset market after the New Year’s holiday, with altcoins specifically enjoying the bulk of the rally. On Friday, January 2nd, the premier cryptocurrency jumped to above the psychological $90,000 level. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that there is no need for investors to be excited about the recent Bitcoin price action. Bitcoin Price Needs To Cross The STH Average Cost At $99,000 In a January 2nd post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that the recent price jump for Bitcoin does not say a lot about the current market structure. The on-chain data pundit’s evaluation is based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price, which currently lies around the $99,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K For context, the Short-Term Holder Realized Price is an on-chain metric that tracks the average price where Bitcoin short-term investors (holding for less than 115 days) acquired their coins. Being the average cost basis of the most reactive group of investors, the STH Realized Price often functions as a dynamic support and resistance level. While the price of BTC slipped beneath the Short-Term Holder Realized Price four times in the past year, it has been below this critical threshold since September 2025. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin price needs to close above this STH Realized Price at $99,000 before bull run conversations can resume. Kesmeci wrote on X: No bull market without the short-term investor with a broken heart being made happy. This statement reiterates the importance of short-term investors in market dynamics. For instance, in this case, breaking the Short-Term Holder Realized Price would suggest the return of demand and confidence among the most reactive investor cohort. Data Converges Between $99,000 And $102,000 Furthermore, Kesmeci pointed out that additional on-chain data reinforces the critical importance of the $99,000 region to the Bitcoin price trajectory. The crypto analyst said that significant data is converging in the $99,000 – $102,000 range, and until this region is surpassed, the price of BTC might continue to struggle. In an earlier post on the X platform, Kesmeci had revealed that the price of BTC needs to close above $101,000 for the long-term trend to turn positive. This explains why the analyst later concluded that the $99,000 – $102,000 bracket is pivotal to Bitcoin’s health. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $90,110, reflecting a roughly 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Many altcoins have performed a lot better on a daily scale, including some of the meme coin reps, such as DOGE and PEPE. BTC to Face More Volatility? After being one of the few global assets to end 2025 in the red , bitcoin’s price finally started to show some revival signs on January 2. Following a quiet January 1, in which it remained sideways between $87,000 and $88,000, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive yesterday and broke past $90,000 for the first time in about a week. This time, the bulls kept the pressure on and drove it even further north to a multi-week peak of $91,000. However, that was as far as BTC would go, at least for now, and it quickly retraced to $90,000. It added several hundred dollars late on Friday, but the explosions in Venezuela’s capital on Saturday morning halted its progress. Bitcoin dipped to $89,300 but now sits closer to $90,000 after US President Donald Trump confirmed that his country’s military was behind the strikes against Caracas. Moreover, he added that the US captured Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. A press conference is expected later today, which could result in more volatility in the crypto market, given that it’s the only financial market open today. For now, BTC’s market cap has neared $1.8 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is below 57% on CG. BTCUSD Jan 3.

PEPE is the other notable meme coin gainer, having surged by another 15% to $0.000006. Nevertheless, MYX has stolen the show with an 85% pump today to almost $7.

The timing of the incident has not fared well for Bitcoin, which slipped below $90,000 after trading above the price mark for the better part of Friday’s trading hours. As confirmed by CBS News, US troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and flew him outside the country in the company of his wife. Local news outlets reported that several explosions were heard around 1:50 AM local time on Saturday (12:50 AM Eastern Time). STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP pic.twitter.com/nHDqtsqRFh — Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) January 3, 2026 Trump wrote on Truth Social that “further details would follow,” and he would hold a press briefing at his Mar-a-Lago residence at 11 AM ET. The US also seized two Venezuelan oil tankers in recent weeks, launched strikes on more than 30 vessels allegedly carrying drugs, and hit “the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs.” Maduro denied all accusations of drug trafficking or collaboration with terrorist organizations. Venezuela’s president captured: What it means for crypto Just two hours after news about the Venezuelan air strikes broke, Bitcoin slipped downwards to $89,571, from nearly $91,000 the previous day. Several market analysts believe any form of war in the West, the purported “hotbed” for crypto adoption, is extremely bearish for digital assets just three days into the new year. “Oh, is Bitcoin back over 90K? It would be a real shame if someone… BOMBED VENEZUELA. Notice that all of the bullshit happens on Friday nights because Trump wants stock markets to have 48 hours to absorb the news,” Bitcoin investor Lark Davis surmised. According to market observer Ether Rawl, during Israel’s attack on Gaza in October 2023, Bitcoin dropped approximately 5% in the days following. He suggested the Venezuela strikes could push the king coin below the weekly 100 EMA, slightly under $86,000, and it is still unknown if a recovery will materialize. Trading group Money Ape sees the US-Venezuela tussle as a war on Bitcoin and crypto, and is adamant President Trump has chosen to take custody of Maduro now because “he is manipulating the market.” BREAKING: 🇺🇸 US is attacking Venezuela. And it's happening exactly when crypto is trying to recover. F*cking tired of this shit now. — Ash Crypto (@AshCrypto) January 3, 2026 The US dollar fell to around 98.2 on the first trading day of 2026, after counting a 9% annual loss in 2025. A fall in the greenback’s value would mean the crypto market is ready for a comeback under normal conditions, but with the war on Venezuela in play, Bitcoin bulls might not have enough in their tank to shake off end-2025’s bearish effects. “I am still long until 94k at least. The only problem I see is the war between Trump and Venezuela. If the conflict escalates, we’re going to have choppy price action,” economist Market Hokkage predicts. Political backlash from Liberals in the United States Before today’s events, congressional Democrats and some Republicans had attempted to limit Trump’s military options in Venezuela. They had been seeking to take away the POTUS’ powers through a congressional plea and forced votes in both the House and Senate, all of which were unsuccessful. Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a US Marine Corps veteran and part of the brigade against President Trump, wrote on X earlier today that the strikes are “illegal” and “the second unjustified war in his lifetime.” According to TRM Labs’ Country Crypto Adoption Index, Venezuela rose to 11th place globally in 2025, up from 14th in 2024, with just 27 million and a per capita GDP of $3,100. Venezuelans are using cryptocurrencies to preserve savings and to shield themselves from an unstable, inflation-ridden economy. The Trump critics propounded that airstrikes could stifle a growing crypto economy and destroy its oil economy that is already entangled with USDT. “If the United States succeeds in imposing control over Venezuela, and by extension over the world’s largest proven oil reserves, it will mark a major shift in global power. What happens in Venezuela will not stay in Latin America. It will shape the limits of American power, and the direction of geopolitical confrontation far beyond Caracas,” said Iranian journalist Ibrahim Majed.

The pre-launch phase began on April 1, following the conclusion of the presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market’s revival continues, with Bitcoin (BTC) on the verge of reclaiming $90,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% at $89,440. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other tokens are also trading in positive territory. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Reaches $0.00024675 Husky Inu AI’s (HINU) latest price increase has taken the value of the HINU token from $0.00024581 to $0.00024675. The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project has raised $917,618 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Investors had adopted a wait-and-watch approach, but the recent uptick suggests risk appetite has returned. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. Official Launch Date Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Continues Uptrend Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market extended its uptrend as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and other tokens traded in positive territory. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $90,000 mark on January 2, reaching an intraday high of $90,832. However, with sellers active above $90,000, bulls lost momentum as the price dipped back below $90,000. However, buyers have prevented further downside, as BTC has held above $89,000. The price is up nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $89,634. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $3,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied from $3,025 to an intraday high of $3,143 before moving to $3,095, up over 2%. Ripple (XRP) is up 7% and Solana (SOL) is up over 2% at $130. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 7% and Cardano (ADA) is trading in positive territory, up 6% at $0.386. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable price increases over the past 24 hours. As a result, the crypto market cap is up 1.15% at $3.06 trillion. 24-hour trading volume has also registered a substantial increase of 68% to reach $118 billion.

56769737,https://cryptonews.com/?p=470041,1767446287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56769737.jpeg,Santiment Warns FOMO Could Return if Bitcoin Hits $92K,https://cryptonews.com/news/santiment-warns-fomo-could-return-if-bitcoin-hits-92k/,cryptonews,"Crypto analytics platform Santiment has cautioned that retail FOMO could emerge if Bitcoin climbs above $92,000. The warning comes as Bitcoin trades near $90,000 early in 2026, with social sentiment showing its strongest bullish spike in six months despite modest trading volumes during the post-holiday period. Source: TradingView Brian, Santiment’s head of content, noted during a January 2nd livestream that Bitcoin’s approach toward the psychological $90,000 threshold typically triggers retail buying pressure. “ Usually when we see something like 89.9K, there’s a bit of a retail push to at least hit that milestone, ” he explained, adding that such moves often precede increased volatility as limit sells activate and FOMO intensifies. Mixed Signals as New Year Trading Begins Market data reveals a complex picture as 2026 opens. Bitcoin’s social volume remained flat, with just a 0.06% change from the previous week, while Ethereum saw a minimal increase of 1%. Mid-cap altcoins attracted more attention, with Dogecoin discussions jumping 57% and Cardano rising 19%, suggesting retail interest may be shifting toward smaller assets after what traders called “ the bloodbath that was the end of 2025. “ Source: X/@santimentfeed Santiment’s positive-versus-negative sentiment ratio for Bitcoin reached nearly 2:1 on January 1st, the highest reading since early October. This marks the strongest bullish sentiment shift in over six months, though analysts remain cautious about interpreting the surge. “ I’m not necessarily going to be too worried about a lot of FOMO going on right now, ” Brian stated, noting the timing coincides with traders returning from holidays rather than genuine conviction. The sentiment spike appears exclusive to Bitcoin, with Ethereum and XRP showing more neutral readings. Mentions of “ higher or above ” also outweighed “ lower or below ” references, reinforcing the optimistic tone among retail traders. However, historical patterns suggest extreme bullish sentiment often precedes corrections as markets move contrary to crowd expectations. Whale Accumulation Provides Bullish Foundation On-chain metrics paint a more encouraging picture beneath the surface noise. Wallets holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin accumulated approximately 65,500 BTC since November 30th, with 55,400 BTC added in just the past two weeks alone. This represents the highest percentage of supply held by whales and sharks since November 10th. Maxim Balashevich, Santiment’s founder and CEO, suggested the current price action could reflect anticipation of MicroStrategy’s expected weekend purchases. “ There could be some players betting on the Saylor, ” he noted. “ Maybe can engage some retail jump to the wagon of new year buying might work. “ The accumulation pattern contrasts with retail behavior, as smaller wallets holding less than 0.01 Bitcoin continued adding to positions throughout the recent volatility. This simultaneous buying from both whales and retail investors creates uncertainty, as historical patterns favor rallies when large holders accumulate while small traders sell. $BTC path into 2026 looks increasingly mixed • $100K lost, no late-year rally • ETFs see outflows, macro pressure grows • Whales still accumulating on dips #Bitcoin #BTC #2026 https://t.co/24wCTbRK7W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 Choppy Waters Expected Before Directional Move Santiment analysts expect sideways trading through the weekend before clearer signals emerge. “ We need to wait until Monday to get more data ,” Balashevich stated, noting that many U.S. traders remain on holiday until next week. He anticipates potential upside through Sunday, driven by speculation around institutional buying, followed by either downside on Monday or continued consolidation, depending on broader market conditions. The 30-day market-to-realized-value ratio sits near breakeven, while the 365-day metric shows long-term holders down 11.5% from October’s all-time high of $126,000. Network growth remained strong at year-end, though profit-taking spiked to six-week highs on January 2nd as traders capitalized on the move toward $90,000. Looking ahead, Santiment emphasizes monitoring whether Bitcoin can break above $92,000 without triggering excessive retail enthusiasm. The platform’s data suggests that while whale accumulation provides bullish underpinning, a FOMO-driven rally above key resistance levels could set up conditions for a sharper correction once speculative fever peaks.

56770068,652163,1767441618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56770068.jpeg,Crypto Market Oracle: The Whale Who Nailed Every Top Makes 3 Bold Predictions For This Year,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-oracle-3-predictions-for-this-year/,bitcoinist,"Market expert DeFi Tracer has compiled a series of predictions from an influential figure in the cryptocurrency market — specifically, a “whale,” or an investor with a large portfolio. This particular whale has accurately anticipated every Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high and numerous crypto market tops since 2015. Long-term Vision The whale’s latest forecasts for 2026, unveiled in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), include an ambitious target of $250,000 for Bitcoin (BTC), $20,000 for Ethereum (ETH), and $1,500 for Solana (SOL). However, this whale’s insights extend beyond mere numbers. He emphasizes the current phase of infrastructure development that encompasses critical elements such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), custodial services, regulatory advancements, and the strategic adjustments made by corporate balance sheets. According to his analysis, the market’s transition into this new phase often triggers an initial decline in prices as speculation fades. He suggests that the rise won’t be immediate; instead, it will involve a gradual, steady demand as the market stabilizes. While not explicitly stated, his model indicates that he does not anticipate a quick surge in prices. Instead, he envisions “a pressure phase” characterized by several key developments: weak hands are shaken out, credit positions are liquidated, and “easy” leverage is removed from the market. This transition—moving from speculation to accumulation—typically follows a predictable sequence: speculation leads to heightened volatility , which is then followed by liquidations and fear, causing retail investors to exit. Ultimately, exits pave the way for stabilization, which sets the stage for future upside. What To Expect For Crypto In 2026 In this context, DeFi Tracer suggests that Bitcoin might experience a decline to around $50,000 before the accumulation phase begins in earnest. This implies a potential 44% correction ahead for the cryptocurrency from current trading levels slightly above $89,600. The reasoning behind this perspective is straightforward: the market requires a cleansing process before launching into a new bull run. Looking toward 2026, the indicators suggest that the whale’s analysis is on point. Signs indicate that the necessary cleansing of the market is nearing completion and that the long-awaited growth phase is just around the corner. Several macroeconomic factors underline this optimism. Notably, metals have reached all-time highs and are now shifting capital into cryptocurrencies. The traditional four-year market cycle has drawn to a close, while governments worldwide are showing increasing interest in acquiring cryptocurrencies. The expert concluded that while 2025 was marked by a correction and cleansing of the crypto market, 2026 is poised for what the whale describes as structural growth. This process will reportedly be methodical and steady rather than rapid and chaotic, suggesting a systematic recovery for cryptocurrencies.

She argued that vague rules have long caused crypto companies to relocate overseas, noting that the proposed crypto legislation would alleviate uncertainty, establish clear rules, strengthen protections, and make the US a global leader. Insiders said that US lawmakers would review the CLARITY Act on January 15. If the markup goes through favorably, however, it would imply that lawmakers believe the bill will have sufficient support to pass a formal committee vote. At the same time, the push for clearer crypto rules comes as the United States grapples with a rapidly expanding national debt, which has climbed above $38 trillion , intensifying scrutiny of the country’s long-term fiscal outlook. Rising interest costs and persistent deficits have renewed interest among policymakers and investors in alternative financial technologies that could improve market efficiency and capital formation. John D’Agostino believes the bill will be enacted soon Speaking on the bill, Lummis urged legislators on X: “Our market structure legislation changes that by establishing clear jurisdiction, strong protections, and ensuring America leads the way. Let’s get this done!” In their review, legislators will be examining where DeFi aligns with federal law. They will also explore how to better distinguish between the SEC and CFTC’s roles in regulating digital assets. John D’Agostino, the Institutional Head of Strategy at Coinbase, says the bill is already on the path to progress, and he remains optimistic about its steady improvement, despite frustration from the crypto sector. He also expects the strategic bill to be passed soon. He addressed the bill’s delay in an interview with CNBC, saying that since the legislation is “fundamental” to crypto and other real asset classes, it is only reasonable that it takes time. There is a strong chance that the CLARITY Act will be enacted, he added, referring to growing global regulatory momentum and Spain’s forward-leaning initiatives as examples. Spain has already begun passing new cryptocurrency legislation, like the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8). D’Agostino also said that US lawmakers might feel pressured to act swiftly as other nations ramp up their cryptocurrency efforts. He added he hopes the bill can be approved this January. He also compared the bill to the GENIUS Act, stating that the former is more complex than the latter. But he sees the GENIUS Act as transformative, adding that the passage of the CLARITY Act would be another crucial milestone in the US’s crypto journey ahead. The CLARITY Act would need 60 votes to move forward If the Republicans voted as a bloc, the CLARITY Act would likely pass the committee level even without Democratic support. But its eventual passage would be more contentious. After the Senate Agriculture Committee piece is merged, 60 votes will be necessary in the Senate to end debate, hence the importance of cross-party support. Tim Scott, the chair of the Banking Committee, spoke to reporters ahead of the recess, saying the conversations with Democrats were fruitful, and some industry players responded cautiously with optimism. If the legislation were enacted, this would create rules that regulate the digital asset market in a way that moves beyond long-term, enforcement-driven regulation. It would also clarify which token types are considered securities or commodities, explain how exchanges and brokers can register, and enable regulators to exert more control over spot crypto. Supporters also said the changes would provide regulatory clarity and strengthen consumer protections, as well as America’s standing compared to places with clear frameworks for cryptocurrencies.

According to reports, the sophisticated phishing campaign is currently circulating within the community, posing significant risks to users intending to download the newly announced Eternl Desktop application. The hackers craft professional emails claiming to promote a legitimate wallet solution designed for secure Cardano staking and governance participation. The announcement uses terms related to users earning rewards, including NIGHT and ATMA token rewards through the current crypto giveaway program, to establish credibility and drive user engagement. Hackers are targeting Cardano wallet users According to reports, the hackers were able to create a replica of the official Eternl Desktop announcement, complementing it with a message about hardware wallet compatibility, local key management, and advanced delegation control. The email shows a polished, professional tone with proper grammar and no visible spelling errors, making it very effective at deceiving Cardano community members. Meanwhile, it distributes malware to any system it enters. Reports mentioned that the campaign uses a newly registered domain, download(dot)eternldesktop(dot)network, to distribute a malicious installer package without the need for an official verification or digital signature validation. In the detailed technical analysis carried out by Anurag, an independent threat hunter and malware analyst, the legitimate Eternl.msi file contains a hidden LogMeIn Resolve remote management tool bundled within its installation package. The discovery exposed a supply chain abuse attempt aimed at establishing persistent unauthorized access on victim systems. The malicious MSI installer, with a size of 23.3 megabytes and with hash 8fa4844e40669c1cb417d7cf923bf3e0, drops an executable called unattended updater.exe, which uses the original filename GoToResolveUnattendedUpdater.exe. During runtime analysis, the executable creates an identified folder structure under the system’s Program Files. Once it creates the Program Files, it creates a directory and writes multiple configurations, including unattended.json, logger.json, mandatory.json, and pc.json. The unattended.json configuration file enables remote access functionality without needing the user to interact. The dropped executable attempts to establish connections to infrastructure associated with legitimate GoTo Resolve Services, including devices-iot.console.gotoresolve.com and dumpster.console.gotoresolve.com. Malware provides hackers with remote access According to network analysis, the malware sends information to the hackers in JSON format. It also uses remote servers to establish a communication channel for command execution and system monitoring. Security researchers say this behavior is important because remote management tools allow hackers to carry out remote command execution and steal credentials once the malware is installed on a victim’s system. The Cardano phishing campaign also shows how hackers use crypto and the branding of legitimate platforms to distribute tools that have been infected with malware. This means that users need to verify the authenticity of the software they use through official channels. In addition, they must also avoid downloading wallet applications from unverified sources or newly registered domains, irrespective of how good their distribution emails appear. This Cardano phishing campaign is similar to the one that targeted customers using Meta for advertisements last year. Users are lured with emails that claim their ads have been temporarily suspended due to violations of advertising policies and EU regulations. The scammers even go as far as making it appear legitimate by adding the official Instagram branding and official-sounding language about policy violations. However, closer inspection showed that the emails were from a different domain. Researchers mentioned that upon clicking the link, users are redirected to a fake Meta Business page that looks convincing. The website mimics the real support site, opening up with a page that warns the user that their account faces termination if they do not take action immediately. Users are tricked into inputting their Ad login into the spaces provided, with the customer support guiding them with a provided step-by-step instruction to restore their accounts.

According to the report, scammers stole close to $33 million from victims. The FBI noted that in most cases, scammers impersonated either a company or a bank to carry out their illicit activities. The FBI claimed that some bad actors went as far as calling their victims and advising them to deposit money into a Bitcoin ATM to protect their funds. The criminals would tell them that their accounts have been compromised, riding on the panic to push them into sending the funds via a Bitcoin ATM for safekeeping. Instead, the money goes to a wallet or account maintained by the hacker or another person in their network. Bitcoin ATM fraud hits a new record in 2025 Bitcoin ATMs increased in popularity in the United States, with more than 30,000 machines in the state in 2024. The figure represents 81.27% of the total Bitcoin ATMs in the world, according to Finance Magnates. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) mentioned that more than 10,000 people were victims of Bitcoin ATM fraud in 2025 alone. The agency mentioned that there were over 12,000 complaints from January to December in 2025. In its statement, the FBI also mentioned that the monetary value lost to criminals reached $333.5 million, an increase compared to the same time span last year. In 2024, the FTC reported that digital assets scams in particular were more financially devastating than other types of fraud, noting that midway through the year, the median loss reported by individuals related to crypto fraud was $5,400. The median individual loss tied to reports of general fraud stood at $447. The FBI mentioned that the amount lost to the criminals has been on the rise with each passing year. Data from the FTC showed that Bitcoin ATMs were responsible for $114 million in reported losses in 2023 and $78 million in losses in 2022. This means that the reported losses due to Bitcoin ATM fraud more than doubled in the last two years. Notably, these are figures of reported losses, with the FTC not accounting for losses that were not reported. FTC urges users to be cautious The FTC has advised people to pay close attention to all red flags when making transactions with Bitcoin ATMs. They have also advised people to double-check with their financial officer or banks whenever they are contacted by someone they do not know to deposit funds in a Bitcoin ATM. The agency also advised individuals to slow down and not allow the other person at the end of the line to rush them into making payments, noting that they should discuss things with people around them before making any payment. Bitcoin has been one of the few instruments used to carry out fraud, with criminals choosing to use the asset because of its privacy-focused transactions. The FTC has also warned that government agencies and legitimate businesses will not contact users and ask them to pay for services in Bitcoin. Except otherwise stated, users should not pay for any service or goods using Bitcoin ATMs. In a case where someone is hounding them, they should report to the police. While fraud does not only affect certain demographics, scammers have been targeting the older generations more. This is because they are susceptible to crypto crimes, the data shows. In the report, victims 60 and above account for 715 of the reported losses using Bitcoin ATMs during the first half of 2024, losing $46 million according to the FTC. In some cases, the criminals used AI deepfakes of a family member, asking the elderly person to pay Bitcoin in exchange for their release from the police station.

The premier cryptocurrency closed 2025 with a range-bound price performance, recording no significant movement in the past month of December. However, beneath this early price strength, recent on-chain evaluation reveals that Bitcoin may be at a critical point, where positive price action contrasts with underlying market dynamics. Negative Ratios Don’t Mean Price Bottoms: Alphractal CEO Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson recently took to X to explain what a negative Sharpe Ratio could mean for the Bitcoin price. For context, the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio is a metric that measures how efficiently Bitcoin’s returns compensate investors for the level of volatility (risk) taken over a given period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K Readings above 1 from this metric signal a healthy market, where investors are getting rewards for their stakes. On the other hand, values under 0 typically indicate that the market is in a high-risk, low-return state. Simply put, Bitcoin’s investors, in this scenario, are not being efficiently rewarded for their contributed capital. As observed in the chart above, the ratio recently slipped below the 0 threshold. Seeing as this is occurring while price regains previous levels, it becomes clear that there is an inefficiency between risk allocation and returns. Wedson further shared, based on historical data, that Bitcoin typically displays its best performance when its Sharpe Ratio is well above zero, particularly at levels 1 and above. This positive signal is usually proof of a consistent state of balance between risk and reward. In contrast, negative readings often correlate with prolonged consolidation periods, choppy price movements, or even cycle transitions, providing context to long-term investors on current market dynamics. Historically, these periods have appeared during cooling phases, or before sentiment resets, rather than precisely at market bottoms. By extension, this means that while downside risk may not be high, upside efficiency remains limited until market conditions see relevant improvement. Ultimately, Wedson concluded that the current level of the Sharpe Ratio calls for cautious optimism, especially as the low doesn’t necessarily mean the bottom is in. Bitcoin Price 2026 Outlook After closing 2025 in the red, the question has been swirling around how the Bitcoin price would perform in the new year. While various verdicts have filtered across the crypto community, weighted sentiment suggests that the market leader would continue its struggles in 2026. The lack of apparent demand growth shows that BTC might have already entered a bear market, with the bottom not due until the last quarter of 2026. In essence, the premier cryptocurrency might see an extended period of correction over the next few months. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at approximately $89,886, reflecting a 1.4% price jump over the past day.

While the price action remains below major moving averages, the recent bullish push is giving traders a reason to watch closely. Momentum is shifting, but major resistance levels still need to be cleared to confirm a reversal. XRP Technical Analysis: The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRPUSDT is trading around $2.00 after bouncing from the $1.8 support zone. The price is still within a descending channel, but today’s daily candle is testing the upper trendline. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages are sitting above, acting as dynamic resistance above the $2.30 zone. If the asset breaks the descending channel and flips this resistance zone, the next target lies around $2.50 and beyond. The RSI has broken above 60, suggesting strengthening momentum, but it is approaching overbought territory, which could cause short-term consolidation. The BTC Pair On the XRPBTC chart, the price has pushed strongly into the 2,230 sat region, after bouncing just above the 2,000 sat key mid-range level. The pair is now eyeing the critical supply zone at 2,500 sats. Earlier in December, the 100-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish outlook, with the former now acting as immediate resistance. Yet, the RSI is now accelerating upward, as the price is pushing higher aggressively. If the current momentum holds, XRP could challenge the upper resistance bands soon.

Back then, almost no one noticed. Fast-forward to today, seventeen years later, that creation has now become one of the most disruptive financial inventions in modern history, surviving ridicule, banks, crashes, and countless declarations of its death. Happy birthday, Bitcoin! 17-Years Old In its infancy, BTC was little more than an experiment among cryptographers and libertarians. It didn’t really have a known price, there were no exchanges where you could openly trade it, and there was no clear use case beyond peer-to-peer value transfer, which was actually intended in the whitepaper. The first known transaction occurred in May 2010 – the infamous Bitcoin Pizza Day , as it is referred to now, when 10,000 BTC was used to purchase two pizzas. At the time, though, Bitcoin was dismissed as a toy for geeks, a failed attempt at digital cash, or as “magical internet money” with no intrinsic value. Later, the first actual attention from the mainstream was for all the wrong reasons. Darknet marketplaces thrived in the early 2010s, and BTC became associated with illegal activity, drugs, and crime, which earned it a reputation as the currency of the underworld. The legacy media quickly labeled it a tool for criminals, and regulators warned that it had no legitimate future. That stigma followed it for years, despite later data showing that illicit activity accounted for only a small fraction of all BTC transactions. From Dead to Trillion-Dollar Asset Bitcoin’s debut on exchanges made it clear that the asset will face some enhanced volatility. It surged, it crashed, then surged again, only to collapse again, and then rise back up. This scenario has repeated countless times for the past over a decade. Given the fact that some of those corrections were by 50%, 60%, or even 80% at times, haters used every moment to call it ‘dead.’ In fact, there are roughly 450 such cases documented since 2010. It was called a bubble or “rat poison square.” It has been compared to the tulip mania, and renowned economists have warned that it would go to zero. However, it never did. Instead, it kept proving them wrong. The narrative began to change during the bull run in 2017 and was solidified after the COVID-19 crash and the subsequent rally. As governments printed unprecedented amounts of fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million units started to matter. Gradually, it was no longer pitched as just “digital cash.” It became something more: digital gold to some, a hedge against monetary debasement to others, or even a long-term store of value. It was further legitimized in 2024 when roughly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States. Later, it became a key factor in the country’s presidential elections, and there are talks about a US-based BTC strategic reserve. Not bad for a teenager. Community Celebrates Naturally, the ever-vocal cryptocurrency community was quick to celebrate Bitcoin’s birthday, which helped launch a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Strategy’s Saylor, the champion behind the world’s largest corporate BTC holder, published an orange cake on X, wishing the cryptocurrency a happy birthday, while Lucky posted: Seventeen years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world. What began as a quiet experiment is now a global monetary network.

56772558,652229,1767452403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56772558.jpeg,Bitfarms’ $30 Million Sale Ends Its Latin American Expansion Story,https://bitcoinist.com/bitfarms-30-million-sale-ends-its-latin-american-expansion-story/,bitcoinist,"Bitfarms Ltd. has completed the sale of its Paso Pe Bitcoin mining site in Paraguay, ending its presence in Latin America. The 70-megawatt facility was sold for up to $30 million, a move that the company says will free cash for projects in North America. Reports have disclosed the deal as part of Bitfarms’ plan to focus its energy and compute efforts closer to home. Sale Terms And Payout Schedule According to the company, the buyer is the Sympatheia Power Fund , managed by Singapore’s Hawksburn Capital, and the agreement calls for $9 million in cash at closing plus additional milestone payments that could total up to $21 million. A $1 million non-refundable deposit was already paid, and the remaining payments are tied to post-closing conditions expected to be completed over roughly 10 months. The transaction is expected to close within about 60 days, subject to customary conditions. Why Bitfarms Is Moving North Based on reports , Bitfarms’ management said the sale helps it concentrate on North American energy and computing work. Chief Executive Ben Gagnon was quoted saying that the deal brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows, which will be reinvested into North American high-performance computing and AI energy infrastructure in 2026. The company now says its energy portfolio is 100% North American. Market Reaction And Context Markets reacted quickly after the announcement. Traders noted an uptick in Bitfarms’ stock following news of the sale, reflecting investor interest in the company’s cash-flow move and strategic refocus. This sale follows earlier asset moves in Paraguay, including the transfer of other sites in recent months, showing a steady pullback from South America. Sympatheia Power Fund, the buyer, is presented as an infrastructure fund that will take over the Paso Pe site and related operations. Reports describe the fund as being managed by Hawksburn Capital, which is based in Singapore. The buyer’s intentions for the site were not fully detailed in the announcement, but the transfer was framed as a normal handoff of a running energy and mining asset. Analysts have watched miners rework portfolios since the Bitcoin halving and as demand for data compute has risen. Some companies are shifting assets toward flexible power use or repurposing sites for AI and HPC workloads. Bitfarms’ move is one of several examples where operators sell overseas plants and redeploy capital into the US and Canada.

Source: TradingView CryptoPotato reported earlier today that the primary cryptocurrency dipped from almost $91,000 – its peak on Friday, to just under $89,300 after reports emerged about explosions in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas.

This strategic enhancement, effective immediately, represents a major commitment to transparency and accessibility in the volatile crypto sector. Consequently, traders and investors worldwide will now receive continuous updates during core trading hours. The move addresses the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency markets, which operate without traditional closing bells. Therefore, this development marks a pivotal moment for financial journalism in the digital age. Bitcoin World’s Enhanced 24-Hour News Coverage Schedule Bitcoin World’s new operational framework establishes a clear and structured timeline for news delivery. The platform will now provide uninterrupted, real-time cryptocurrency news coverage from Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC through Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC. This schedule strategically covers the vast majority of active global trading periods across major financial hubs. During the designated window from Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC to Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC, the editorial team will shift to a monitored standby mode. However, they will publish immediate updates for major breaking news events, such as regulatory announcements, significant security breaches, or extreme market volatility. This balanced approach ensures resource sustainability while maintaining critical coverage. The decision follows extensive analysis of global trading volume data and reader engagement patterns. Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken report consistent liquidity throughout the week. For instance, weekend trading often sees heightened volatility due to lower liquidity, making timely news even more crucial. Bitcoin World’s schedule now aligns perfectly with these market realities. The editorial team has implemented a structured shift system to manage the expanded hours effectively. This system ensures consistent editorial standards and fact-checking protocols are maintained around the clock. Furthermore, the platform has invested in additional monitoring tools for global regulatory wires and blockchain analytics. Addressing the 24/7 Nature of Digital Asset Markets Unlike traditional stock markets, cryptocurrency networks never close. Blockchain transactions settle continuously, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols operate autonomously at all hours. This creates an insatiable need for timely information. A 2024 report by the Crypto Market Integrity Coalition highlighted that over 35% of major price movements occur outside standard U.S. market hours. Bitcoin World’s new schedule directly mitigates this information gap. The platform will now track developments across all time zones, from Asian market openings to North American late-night sessions. This comprehensive coverage is essential for risk management and informed decision-making. The Strategic Rationale Behind Expanded Crypto Journalism This expansion is not merely a logistical change but a strategic response to evolving market demands. The cryptocurrency industry has matured significantly, attracting institutional investors, regulated funds, and corporate treasuries. These professional participants require reliable, constant information flows to manage portfolios and comply with oversight requirements. Bitcoin World’s initiative fills a notable void in the current media landscape. Many traditional financial news outlets still treat crypto as a niche segment, offering sporadic coverage. In contrast, dedicated crypto media often lacks the structured editorial rigor of established news organizations. Bitcoin World aims to bridge this divide by applying journalistic standards to continuous coverage. The platform’s editorial director cited the increasing correlation between crypto assets and macroeconomic news as a key driver. Events like Federal Reserve announcements, inflation data releases, or geopolitical tensions now instantly impact digital asset prices. These events can occur at any time. Therefore, having a dedicated team to provide context and analysis in real-time adds tremendous value for the community. The schedule also accounts for the global nature of crypto regulation. Important policy statements from authorities in Europe, Asia, or the Middle East can happen during traditional off-hours for Western media. Continuous coverage ensures these developments are reported without delay. Key operational highlights of the new schedule include: Real-time alerts for market-moving events like exchange outages or large wallet movements. Scheduled analysis of daily market opens in Asia, Europe, and North America. Live coverage of major blockchain network upgrades or governance votes. Breaking news protocols for security incidents and regulatory actions. Implementing Journalistic Rigor on a Continuous Clock Maintaining accuracy and neutrality during 24-hour operations presents unique challenges. Bitcoin World has developed a multi-layered verification system to address this. All breaking news alerts undergo a two-source confirmation minimum before publication. The editorial team utilizes a tiered response system, categorizing events by urgency and potential impact. For example, a suspected exchange hack triggers an immediate factual bulletin, followed by deeper investigative reporting. This process balances speed with reliability. The platform also employs blockchain forensic tools to verify on-chain events independently. This technical capability strengthens its reporting and builds trust with a technically savvy audience. Impact on Traders, Investors, and the Crypto Ecosystem The primary beneficiaries of this expanded coverage are active market participants. Day traders, algorithmic trading firms, and institutional desks rely on minute-by-minute information to execute strategies. Even long-term investors benefit from immediate awareness of fundamental changes, such as protocol failures or regulatory shifts. Enhanced news transparency can also improve overall market health. Studies in traditional finance, like those from the MIT Sloan School, show that timely information dissemination reduces information asymmetry and can decrease volatility spikes. In crypto’s often-opaque markets, reliable journalism acts as a public good. It empowers all participants with equal access to critical facts. Furthermore, the move raises the bar for crypto media as a whole. It signals a transition from blog-style commentary to professional, around-the-clock journalism. This evolution is crucial for the asset class’s legitimacy. As more traditional finance players enter the space, they expect information standards comparable to those covering equities or bonds. Bitcoin World’s investment in continuous coverage meets this expectation head-on. The schedule also supports the growing ecosystem of crypto derivatives. Futures and options traders, in particular, need to monitor news constantly to manage leverage and risk. A gap in coverage could lead to significant, avoidable losses for these market participants. Comparison of Crypto News Coverage Models Model Coverage Hours Typical Update Speed Best For Traditional Financial News Market Hours + Breaking Minutes to Hours Macro Overview Social Media / Forums 24/7 (Unofficial) Instant (Unverified) Sentiment & Rumors Dedicated Crypto Blogs Business Hours Hours Deep-Dive Analysis Bitcoin World (New Model) 24/7 with Structured Breaks Real-Time (Verified) Active Trading & Risk Management Conclusion Bitcoin World’s implementation of a structured 24-hour cryptocurrency news coverage schedule represents a substantial advancement for the industry. This initiative directly responds to the non-stop nature of digital asset markets and the professionalization of its participants. By providing verified, real-time news during core global trading hours, the platform enhances market transparency and empowers better decision-making. The careful balance of continuous coverage with scheduled maintenance periods ensures editorial sustainability and quality. Ultimately, this move strengthens the foundational information layer of the crypto ecosystem, supporting its continued growth and integration into the global financial system. As the market evolves, such commitments to rigorous, accessible journalism will remain indispensable. FAQs Q1: What exactly are the new operating hours for Bitcoin World’s news coverage? The platform now provides full, real-time coverage from Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC until Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC. From Saturday 3:00 p.m. to Sunday 10:00 p.m. UTC, it operates in a breaking-news-only mode. Q2: Why is 24-hour coverage necessary for cryptocurrency news? Cryptocurrency markets and blockchain networks operate continuously, unlike traditional stock exchanges. Major price movements, hacks, and regulatory news can happen at any time, requiring constant information access for effective trading and risk management. Q3: How will Bitcoin World ensure news accuracy during overnight or weekend shifts? The platform employs a multi-source verification system, dedicated monitoring tools, and a tiered editorial protocol. All breaking news requires confirmation from at least two independent sources before publication, maintaining rigorous standards. Q4: Does this mean there will be no news at all during the shorter Saturday-to-Sunday window? No. During that period, the team will monitor for and publish updates only for major breaking news events, such as significant exchange issues, critical regulatory announcements, or severe market disruptions. Q5: How does this change benefit the average crypto investor, not just active traders? All investors benefit from timely, accurate information. Long-term holders need to know about fundamental threats like network vulnerabilities or regulatory changes immediately. This coverage reduces information asymmetry and helps everyone make more informed decisions.

December ended with 58 disclosed investment projects, up 3.6% from 56 in November. Monthly funding moved in the opposite direction. Disclosed capital for December totaled $860 million, down 94.1% from $14.54 billion in November. Crypto deal activity contracts while capital concentrates The entirety of 2025 saw 898 disclosed investment projects, a 42.1% plunge from 1,551 projects in 2024, meaning few deals are carrying far larger checks across the crypto venture capital market. According to RootData, DeFi took the largest share at 22.4% of total crypto VC projects, CeFi followed at 13.8%, while AI had 12.7%. RWA and DePIN made up 7.3%, as L1 and L2 projects reached 6%, and NFT/GameFi slipped to 5.3%, matching tools and wallets at 5%. The year’s largest transaction landed in November when Naver agreed to acquire Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, in an all‑stock deal valued at about $10.3 billion, pushing Naver’s value to 4.9 trillion won and Dunamu’s to 15.1 trillion won. Crypopolitan had in October reported that Dunamu saw consolidated operating income of 1.19 trillion won for the first nine months of 2025, up 22% year-over-year, with 97.9% of revenue tied to trading platforms, including Upbit. In May, Coinbase completed a $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, paying $700 million in cash and the remainder in stock. Mega financing deals boost corporate balance sheets holding crypto Corporate issuance drove many of the year’s largest crypto VC raises, starting in July when Strategy raised $2.52 billion through its fourth preferred stock product, Stretch, with net proceeds of about $2.474 billion after fees. Crypopolitan then reported that Strategy used the funds to buy 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256, making its total holdings now 628,791 BTC, or $74 billion. Earlier in February, Strategy had issued $2 billion in zero‑coupon notes due 2030, carrying a 40% to 50% conversion premium and a three‑year put option. In October, Intercontinental Exchange, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in Polymarket at an $8 billion pre‑investment valuation. The deal gave ICE a stake and global distribution rights for Polymarket’s event‑driven data. In March, Abu Dhabi MGX (funded by the Abu Dhabi government and controlled by the royal family) invested $2 billion in Binance for a minority stake, paid for using stablecoins exclusively, and became the largest crypto‑asset‑only investment recorded. In September, Forward Industries completed a $1.65 billion private placement using cash and stablecoins to launch a Solana‑based digital asset vault strategy, led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. In March, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, securing a CFTC‑registered FCM license to offer futures and derivatives in the United States while expanding in the U.K., EU, and Australia.

These patterns help traders and investors understand the mechanics behind rotations, momentum, and accumulation across major digital assets. While individual performance varies, analyzing structural formations provides insight into how capital may flow between Bitcoin and altcoins over extended periods. This framework was highlighted by a pseudonymous X user, Stockmoney Lizards, a crypto strategist renowned for studying cross-asset dynamics and technical setups. He noted that even assets he is less bullish on, such as XRP, can serve as clear examples of multi-year breakout patterns, offering a template to observe broader market behavior. Altcoins Form a Comparable Structure Stockmoney Lizards observed that altcoins, measured against Bitcoin, are forming a structure similar to XRP’s breakout pattern. Currently, many altcoins remain technically oversold, signaling potential for recovery once broader market conditions align. I am not a huge fan of XRP, but it will serve as an example for a multi-year breakout pattern, I have rarely seen before. If you look at Altcoins chart vs. BTC (lower image), a similar formation is just building up. My scenario for 2026 would be as follows: – Bitcoin maybe… pic.twitter.com/ezo0MwnOb1 — Stockmoney Lizards (@StockmoneyL) January 2, 2026 Historical trends suggest that assets showing such setups often attract algorithm-driven activity first, which then pulls in retail and institutional traders, amplifying momentum. This indicates that, while Bitcoin may consolidate or range initially, capital could rotate into altcoins , creating upward pressure across the sector. Understanding these patterns provides traders with actionable insight beyond simple speculation. Projected Market Rotation in 2026 According to Stockmoney Lizards, Bitcoin may range for a period before breaking out to a new all-time high. Following this, Bitcoin dominance could decline, allowing altcoins to recover strongly. Even if altcoins face another corrective phase toward the end of 2026, this cycle could establish higher bases compared to current levels, setting the foundation for the next upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This scenario relies on structural market principles rather than speculation. The concept of money rotation, well-known in traditional finance, predicts that capital flows from previously dominant assets to underperforming but technically promising alternatives, often fueling sustained momentum. Technical Catalysts and Institutional Support Structural catalysts also support this rotation. Multiple ETF launches targeting crypto exposure , including altcoins, enhance liquidity and attract institutional participation. These factors increase the likelihood of rapid market moves once technical reversals confirm initial trends. Assets that have underperformed significantly become more appealing as investors seek value and diversification. Patterns Over Preference Stockmoney Lizards emphasizes that the lesson lies in observing patterns rather than personal preference. XRP illustrates how multi-year breakout formations provide insight into potential altcoin surges and broader market rotations. By studying these structures, traders can anticipate flows between Bitcoin and altcoins, positioning themselves to capitalize on both short-term reversals and long-term trends.

56776586,652183,1767457859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56776586.jpeg,Binance Bitcoin STH Activity Falls By $8 Billion In December  — Here’s Why,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sth-activity-falls-by-8-billion-in-december/,bitcoinist,"Initially, Bitcoin began the last month of 2025 with significant bearish momentum, with the price structure taking on a clear bearish direction. However, this downside momentum soon weakened after the flagship cryptocurrency encountered its $85,000 support. Since then, Bitcoin traded mostly within a consolidatory range, struggling to break out of either end of the chart convincingly. Interestingly, an on-chain analysis has been released that examines the dynamics that may have influenced BTC’s December performance. Binance Inflows See Rapid Monthly Decline From $24.7B To $16.54B In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, market expert CryptoOnchain shares findings on evaluating inflows into Binance in the name of Bitcoin. The indicator involved in this analysis is the Binance Monthly Inflow By UTXO Age metric, which determines how much Bitcoin (in USD or BTC terms) flows into Binance each month, broken down by the age of the UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) being deposited. CryptoOnchain highlights that this downturn in money inflows was influenced by young UTXOs (transactions less than a day old). From its November high of approximately $24.7 billion, the metric quickly dropped to $16.54 billion in December, marking an $8.16 billion inflow gap. Typically, young UTXOs are a means through which short-term speculative behavior can be tracked, seeing as they are representative of recently transferred coins. Hence, the significant drop in Binance inflow indicates a growing unwillingness among short-term holders to sell their coins. It is worth noting that heightened inflows from this investor group point to a growing inclination to sell. This translates to the Bitcoin price as elevated bearish pressure, which leads to short-term price corrections. The inflows decline in December is therefore an inversion. It reveals a “cooling of speculative activity,” which in turn translates on the charts as a significant loss of selling pressure. The crypto pundit further highlights possible reasons for this exodus of speculative activity. Structurally, the analyst conjectures that the inflow decline could be due to fading price momentum, characteristic of the final days of the year. Short-term holders might have exited the market due to caution, to observe what the new year brings, without getting caught in the mix. This action then causes a “handover of supply control” to Bitcoin’s mid-term and long-term investors. Historically, such transitions have been associated with consolidation phases and periods of lower volatility, where no significant amount of directional momentum is seen. Hence, if history is anything to go by, the Bitcoin price could be gearing up for sustainable cycles in the coming months. Bitcoin Price Overview At press time, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $89,533, with CoinMarketCap data showing a daily growth of 0.85%.",Bitcoin|binance|bitcoin|CryptoOnchain|CryptoQuant|Short Term Trader Activity|Young UTXOs,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The top cryptocurrency in the world ended the year with a negative performance of around 5% in value. The cryptocurrency is presently stuck in a narrow band around $88,410. Not many people are pleased with this performance in the market. It has been noticed that they are selling Bitcoin at a discount. Investors who are looking for actual growth have to come up with a different approach. They are leaving the stagnant coins behind and looking for projects which have the potential to make yields. One such cheap crypto project which smart money is showing interest in is called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for short. It provides a clear way to a massive profit thanks to a strong DeFi proposition. The Problem with a Stagnant Giant Bitcoin is considered digital gold and is wonderful for overall stability. However, it misses the strong yield structures exhibited by cheaper cryptocurrency projects. At the current moment, Bitcoin is exhibiting low volatility and a negative return on the year. This is putting the endurance of investors to the test. The constant pressure from selling indicates that investors are looking for alternatives. A Project Constructed With Value In Mind While the overall market is struggling, the purchase demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is immense. The presale of MUTM has already raked in over $19.5 million. Over 18,650 individuals have already owned the MUTM tokens. The current phase is Phase 7, and the cost of each unit of MUTM is $0.04. The current price is already 300% higher than that of Phase 1, but according to experts, the best days of MUTM are yet to come. The chance to acquire at a price of $0.04 will expire soon, at which point Phase 8 will commence at a higher price of $0.045. Acquiring the tokens now, prior to market listing at $0.06, will render an immediate profit for the investor. The possibility of appreciating further will kick off at market listing. Accumulate Rewards For Holding MUTM Mutuum Finance also has a system for rewarding its supporters. The fees generated through lending on the platform are used automatically to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. The tokens are then given out for free as dividends to the people who stake in the system. This is a very powerful feedback loop. The more people using Mutuum Finance, the more fees, and vice versa, the more tokens are bought back. The more buybacks, the bigger the rewards for holders. This ensures that long-term holders receive rewards twice. Mutuum Finance is almost ready to be launched. The V1 platform of Mutuum Finance is to be launched on the testnet very soon. The trustworthiness of the project has been made sure after the completion of a security audit performed by Halborn. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty program launched to find the bugs present in the platform. Investors who take proactive steps will see that this presale is their final opportunity before a price hike is introduced. Additionally, with a limited supply of tokens in circulation and a soon-to-be-launched platform, there is sufficient evidence that indicates that its price will appreciate. A Smart Move for Better Returns Whereas Bitcoin remains stagnant, shrewd investors are allocating their funds to projects with engines of growth. Mutuum Finance presents an opportunity that leans heavily on the concept of scarcity and utilizes the connection to the success of the platform as the driving factor. The presale phase of the platform is near completion. For those interested in turning market uncertainty into major portfolio growth, membership in the MUTM presale will prove to be an intelligent decision. It’s a choice to join a project intended for use in the future of finance.
