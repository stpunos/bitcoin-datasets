By 2029, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $477.67. In 2032, AAVE will range between $658.59 to $776.19. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2026? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $166.90 Market cap $2.498B Trading volume (24-h) $185.89M Circulating supply 15.18M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $161.00 24-hour high $166.01 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.86% (Very High) 50-day SMA $177.34 14-Day RSI 48.52 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $225.24 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways : AAVE has stabilized above $160 after a sharp selloff, signaling short-term strength. Momentum indicators favor continuation, but $170–175 is a critical resistance zone. Failure to hold $158–160 would quickly revive downside pressure. Aave 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for January 5, AAVE is trading around $166.5 after rebounding from the late-December selloff that pushed price briefly below $150. The recovery is technically meaningful as price has reclaimed the Bollinger mid-band near $160, with expanding green candles suggesting buyers are defending higher lows. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView However, AAVE remains capped well below the upper Bollinger band around $183, which aligns with prior breakdown structure, keeping the broader trend neutral rather than bullish. The MACD has flipped positive with rising histogram bars, signaling improving momentum; however, the move still appears corrective within a larger consolidation unless $170–175 is decisively cleared on strong volume. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE shows a cleaner bullish structure, printing higher highs and higher lows since reclaiming $155. Price is holding above the Alligator moving averages, which are now fanning upward, confirming short-term trend alignment. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI is elevated near 66, indicating strong momentum but also hinting that upside could slow near $168–170, a zone that previously rejected price. As long as $160–158 holds as support, pullbacks remain technically healthy, while a loss of this area would weaken the short-term bullish bias and risk a rotation back toward $150. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $213.50 SELL SMA 5 $186.27 SELL SMA 10 $176.93 SELL SMA 21 $170.49 SELL SMA 50 $177.34 SELL SMA 100 $206.02 SELL SMA 200 $225.24 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $167.60 SELL EMA 5 $178.38 SELL EMA 10 $204.65 SELL EMA 21 $240.76 SELL EMA 50 $268.45 SELL EMA 100 $269.22 SELL EMA 200 $254.01 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is likely to attempt a grind toward $170–175 in the near term, but only a strong daily close above that zone would shift the broader outlook bullish. Otherwise, traders can expect consolidation with heightened sensitivity to any loss of the $160 support. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve. If DeFi continues to grow and mature, Aave isn’t just likely to stick around; it’ll probably be one of the key players shaping the future.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI (14) is 43.25, still below 50, while MACD is still below zero, showing momentum is improving slowly, but buyers are not strong yet. Support is around $0.2042 and $0.200. Resistance is around $0.2056, then $0.206–$0.207, then $0.215 and $0.22. As of January 2, 2026, Pi Network is trading sideways today, with price holding in a tight range just above the $0.20 level as buyers and sellers stay evenly matched. Pi is holding near $0.205, with a market cap around $1.71B and 24-hour volume near $7.96M, which is still light and shows limited conviction. The market looks calm, with Pi stabilizing rather than starting a clear upward move. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows small-bodied candles, showing consolidation rather than a strong move in either direction. Price is basically just above the mid-$0.2052 area with no clear follow-through from buyers or sellers. The RSI (14) is 43.25, with its signal line near 40.96, which keeps momentum below the neutral 50 mark and suggests buyers are still cautious. Selling pressure isn’t aggressive, but RSI needs to push back toward the high-40s/50 area to show stronger demand. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the histogram is +0.0010, while the MACD line is −0.0042 and the signal line is −0.0052. Both lines being below zero means the broader trend is still bearish, but the positive histogram shows the downside pressure is easing and the market is trying to stabilize. Support is around $0.204 and then $0.200, while resistance is near $0.206 and $0.210. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading around $0.2051 and is slightly higher on the session, with the latest candle showing O $0.2049, H $0.2053, L $0.2048, C $0.2051. Price action is still tight, but it’s slowly grinding upward from the late-December dip, with candles holding above the mid-$0.20 area instead of slipping back under it. The RSI (14) is 59.42, with its signal line near 53.00, which keeps momentum above 50 and shows buyers have more control than earlier in the week. It’s not an aggressive rally, but it does suggest the market is leaning slightly positive on this timeframe. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the values are MACD 0.0002, signal 0.0000, and histogram 0.0002. Because these readings are at or just above the zero line, it means bearish pressure has faded, and momentum is mildly positive, but the numbers are small, so the move is still weak and could stay range-bound. Support is around $0.204 and $0.202, while resistance is near $0.206 and $0.208.

If Pi keeps holding the $0.20 support, the most likely move is more sideways trading with small bounces toward the $0.206–$0.21 resistance area. If it drops and closes clearly below $0.20, the downside risk increases, and the price could slide toward the next lower zone before buyers step back in. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is slightly up because supply pressure is easing: today’s large unlock is among the last big daily releases before unlocks drop, and some PI has moved off exchanges, reducing immediate sell pressure in a thin market. On the chart, a mild technical rebound (MACD turning up and RSI still not overbought) is helping, but unclear roadmap sentiment is still limiting a stronger move. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value. Recent Pi News/Opinions Pi Network’s Core Team published a 2025 recap highlighting milestones such as February’s Open Network launch, AI integrations, and ongoing KYC progress.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November.

As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $94,661, it will fuel a bullish rally to $98,513. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $90,573, beginning a bearish trend to $86,304. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying pressure as sellers failed to push the price below immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000.

Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November. Bitcoin ended December 2025 on a bearish note by trading below $90K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Echoing the views of several other prominent voices in finance – notably of Robert Kiyosaki – McGlone opined on January 1 that 2026 will be a year of volatility and crisis but also one of opportunity for the ‘tactically orientated’ to make a fortune. Base Case Update 2026 – Dope-Sniffing Dogs May Prevail: – Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000 – President Trump faces similarly poor timing as Herbert Hoover – A third down year for US stocks since 2008 – Cryptos to lead the next… — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) January 1, 2026 Will the Great Depression 2.0 start in 2026? Though measured in tone, the Commodity Strategist hinted he expects 2026 to be a crisis year by providing a historical parallel. Specifically, he opined that President Donald Trump shall suffer from poor timing, much like President Herbert Hoover. Hoover famously entered the Oval Office in 1929, mere months before the Great Depression started. McGlone provided both evidence for his assumptions and issued several stark predictions. Specifically, he identified gold’s grabbing of alpha – its ability to outperform the market – as a major warning sign evident through much of 2025. Gold grabbing alpha in 2025 was a warning – especially vs. falling crude oil Unfortunately for investors hoping to benefit from the precious metals boom, the market expert also opined that gold, silver , and most similar assets will suffer from, in his words, ‘went up-too-much’ dangers in 2026. Similarly, McGlone identified T-Bonds – the debt securities of the American government – as the stars of the market, as he estimates they will be the ones to ‘take alpha’ from the yellow metal in the ongoing year. Will the crypto market bloom in 2026? Mike McGlone simultaneously gave a word of warning to cryptocurrency investors as he forecasted that a Bitcoin ( BTC ) fall to $50,000 is more likely than a rally back to $100,000. As evidence, he cited that Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the digital assets market – dropped 19% last year. Bitcoin and cryptos have peaked, $50,000 more likely than above $100,000. Cryptos to lead the next post-inflation deflation cycle due to wealth creation reversion. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index dropped 19% in 2025. External evidence that the cryptocurrency bull market can be found in the fact that the 4-year BTC cycle pattern has been broken. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to enjoy three green years followed by a major correction. BTC 12-month price chart.

However, while the pressure is clearly visible, artificial intelligence ( AI ) models suggest that the cryptocurrency may somewhat stabilize this month and maybe see some gains. Some early signs of this stabilization may already be evident, with Bitcoin trading at around $89,500 at the time of writing, up nearly 2% on the day due to a supportive technical picture. Bitcoin price reclaims key technical levels A few of the core momentum measures have also strengthened, led by the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 70.4, signaling firm upside momentum. The MACD value of 319.5 likewise remains positive. Trend strength readings further reinforced the picture. For instance, the Average Directional Index ( ADX ) rose to 65.2, a level typically associated with bullish directional moves. Similarly, a positive Rate of Change ( ROC ) at 1.308 indicates that bulls are firmly in control of order flow. However, it must be noted that the white/red Stochastic Oscillator, which measures price momentum over the past nine periods smoothed across six periods, is at 99.2, suggesting a consolidation period or a pullback toward short-term moving averages is possible. AI Bitcoin price prediction for January 2026 With the technical picture hinting at potential short-term upticks, Finbold used its AI-driven price prediction tool to see where BTC could sit by the end of the month. To generate its forecast, the model aggregates results from ChatGPT , Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4, pointing to a range of potential outcomes. Finbold AI BTC price forecast. Source: Finbold The average Bitcoin price target for the end of January came out at $91,900, implying a 2.67% upside from current levels. Claude Sonnet 4 gave the most bullish figure, projecting a potential 6.97% rally, while Gemini 2.5 Flash actually suggested the price could go down 0.07% downside. ChatGPT was bullish but conservative, arguing for a 1.1% gain. Finbold AI BTC technical analysis. Source: Finbold Overall, Bitcoin’s potential this month primarily reflects its technical resilience, although it can be added that $12 million in altcoin-driven liquidity inflows could also have played a role. In other words, short-term momentum currently favors buyers, who are closely watching whether Bitcoin can defend support around $88,319, the 61.8% Fibonacci level .

According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, a bearish market sentiment has taken hold over the past few months, with some market watchers claiming the top of the four-year market cycle has already passed. The crypto market analytics platform believes investor sentiment has changed due to Bitcoin’s muted end-of-year performance, but the lines between traditional financial assets and crypto are also blurred, as companies experiment with new forms of tokenization. Delphi market analysis: Equity is moving onchain Per Delphi’s 2026 outlook , the distinction between tokens and traditional equity is now more difficult to define since companies like California-based Securitize are filing for initial public offerings (IPOs) while simultaneously looking into tokenization. Crypto is facing a token identity crisis. The lines are blurring on both sides. Equity is moving onchain with companies like Securitize filing for IPOs. Tokens are becoming more equity like through MetaDAO's ownership coins and Uniswap's fee switch. Customer Acquisition Cost… pic.twitter.com/CgjHQuHq8q — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) January 1, 2026 Some crypto projects, such as MetaDAO have launched ownership tokens that mimic how traditional financial firms issue shares, and decentralized platform Uniswap has added fee switches, much like how equity-like returns are for token holders. Among the upcoming token models is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tokens, which are distinct to equity-like tokens or governance mechanisms because they fund user acquisition at scale. PayPal is one of the many companies moving forward with tokenization, having spent over $60 million in venture capital cash on incentives to begin its quest for digital assets. Yet, per Delphi, CAC tokens could achieve comparable results through token emissions, where early adopters can receive larger rewards that taper as the network grows. The analysts cited Worldcoin as the best example of this model, reportedly spreading over 500 million WLD tokens to onboard users and expanding the footprint of its World App. According to data from Dune analytics, the project crossed $3.8 billion market cap level during the bull market run in mid-2025, although its token’s price traded below $2.5 in the whole of last year. US regulatory clarity opens crypto market to institutions Changes in regulations have made things much clearer for the crypto industry, especially in the US and Europe. POTUS signed an executive order in the US to encourage responsible innovation and the use of stablecoins backed by the dollar. However, he also clearly said that a CBDC was not an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went a step ahead to support experimentation by issuing no-action letters for the Depository Trust Company’s tokenization pilot and the Fuse Crypto Token. US Congress is in support of crypto-friendly candidates for 2026 midterms. This comes against the backdrop of discussing the CLARITY Act , which places crypto regulatory oversight in the hands of the CFTC. Although some economists believe there are still some hiccups in country-by-country jurisdictional rules, MiCA has been protecting investors and has made the environment more palatable for institutions to join in. Crypto market mulls optimism as Bitcoin trades just below $90,000 Despite the ongoing gloomy outlook, there is a perception that the industry has grown enough to handle downturns and escape historic crypto winters. “It’s more of an industry now. So if there is a winter or a downturn, it’s not going to be a complete lights-out moment,” Kaiko senior researcher Adam Morgan McCarthy told NPR. The crypto derivatives market has approximately $2.2 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options reaching expiration, with the former taking up $1.87 billion in notional value currently outstanding. At the time of this reporting, the king coin is trading at around $88,970, just above the $88,000 “max pain” point, where option writers may start counting heavy losses. Coinglass open interest data shows 14,194 call contracts have been placed against 6,806 puts, which could mean hodlers are bracing for a price comeback upwards of $90,000.

Price action is compressing, RSI is turning higher, and institutional buyers continue to accumulate, yet prediction markets remain skeptical of a rapid six-figure breakout. Polymarket odds still favor $120,000 as the most likely outcome, even as Bitcoin trades within a tightening triangle near $89,000. The next move could set the tone for the year ahead. Polymarket: Why Traders Are Hesitant to Predict a Quick $150K Bitcoin Price Surge Bitcoin is kickstarting 2026 with a mixed bag of optimism and realism. While analysts are still tossing around six-figure targets, Polymarket traders are still being cautious about how high they think BTC can go before 2027. Looking at the market odds, you see that the most likely outcome is $120,000, with a 45% probability, even though that level is below its 2025 all-time high. But the confidence in higher targets is starting to wane. Polymarket is saying: 35% of traders think $130,000 is a possibility 28% of traders think $140,000 is a possibility 21% of traders think $150,000 is a possibility Source: Polymarket By contrast, the market is saying there’s probably an 80% chance Bitcoin either holds or recovers the $100,000 zone, suggesting traders think it will hold firm but don’t expect a rags-to-riches surge right away. This caution might be due to cycle dynamics – Bitcoin ended last year in the red, and with the 4-year halving cycle coming to a close, traders are probably being a bit more picky about where they put their bets. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Signals Long-Term Commitment On the other hand, despite softer sentiment among individual traders, the institutions are still putting their money where their mouth is. In the last quarter of 2025, Japan-based Metaplanet added 4,279 BTC, bringing its stash to 35,102 BTC, which is worth a cool $3.1 billion at today’s prices. Even though their stock price has been a bit of a dud, they’re still treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Tether has done the same thing. As BTC dipped below $88,000, the stablecoin issuer added 8,889 BTC, which cost them about $778.7 million. These purchases don’t guarantee a quick price spike, but they do show that the big players are using the dips to get a bit more exposure. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Triangle Breakout Or Triangle Breakdown? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction continues to be neutral, as BTC is trading around $89,400, stuck inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. This pattern is more about tightening volatility than any weakness. The price is still forming higher lows, and the resistance line is sloping down from $92,800 to $93,000. BTC is oscillating around a pivot zone near $88,200-$89,000, where the 50-day and 100-day EMA100-day EMAs are converging. This compression of the EMAs is a sign of balance, not a sign that things are approaching a breaking point. As long as the price stays above the rising trendline from $84,400 and the 200-day EMA near $87,000, the overall structure remains constructive. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The candlestick action is backing that up as well. Recent sessions are showing spinning tops and small-bodied candles, which are more a sign of indecision than of selling off. The RSI has broken its short-term downtrend and is now above 55, suggesting momentum is strengthening. If Bitcoin can close above $90,500, that would resolve the triangle to the upside and open a path towards $92,800 and then $95,000. If it breaks below $87,000, though, that would be a blow to the setup and open the possibility of a move down to $85,800; at the moment, the structure is more likely to be on the upside. What Could Trigger Bitcoin’s Next Major Move in 2026 With institutions soaking up supply and price compressing to a technical apex, the setup suggests preparation is underway, not exhaustion. Whether the next move is a measured breakout or just another range expansion will define how quickly those $150,000 targets start looking realistic. For now, traders are betting on patience, and history suggests Bitcoin tends to reward it. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

While there has been no significant bullish breakout yet, the price is pressing against key local resistances. Buyers are trying to reclaim control, but the lack of follow-through makes this a pivotal area to watch. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC remains trapped within a descending channel, testing the upper boundary once again near the critical $90K level. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages located above $95K act as major dynamic resistance levels, and buyers have yet to reclaim them. Despite recent bounce attempts, momentum has been fading. RSI is climbing but is still around the neutral territory, indicating that there is room for a move higher. If buyers fail to break above the $90K zone and the higher boundary of the channel, another visit to the $80K support zone remains likely. Until that breakout happens, this is still a bearish market structure. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the asset has been consolidating in a short-term channel. Multiple rejections from the $90K level, located at the middle of the channel, have formed a mid-range ceiling. Meanwhile, higher lows forming gradually below this zone show that buyers are slowly stepping in. The RSI is also pushing higher, showing bullish momentum building while still not being overbought. If a clean breakout above $90K occurs with strength, it opens up the way for a move toward the primary resistance zone at $95K. On the other hand, failure at the $90K zone could mean another sweep back toward $86K and even a breakdown of the channel that could pave the way for a deeper drop toward the $80K area. On-Chain Analysis The BTC exchange reserve metric continues to drop sharply, hitting 2.75M BTC, a significant multi-year low. This trend reflects ongoing accumulation and reduced sell pressure on centralized exchanges. While the price action has remained stagnant, this underlying metric supports the long-term bullish thesis. However, the disconnect between low reserves and weak price action highlights the broader uncertainty and hesitation among market participants heading into the first quarter of 2026. Therefore, more sideways or even corrections might be required before the market can begin rallying again.

As per the current market, “What price will Bitcoin hit before 2027?” Polymarket shows 45% odds of Bitcoin reaching $120,000. Notably, this price point is below its all-time high. The probabilities drop sharply at higher price levels, with $130,000 carrying a 35% chance, $140,000 falling to 28%, and $150,000 priced at just 21%. Reports indicate that traders are placing a safe bet, with an 80% likelihood that BTC will reach a peak of $100,000 . With this move in place, sources claimed that it was unclear why users opt to be very cautious. Some assumed that they decided to adopt this approach in relation to the end of the four-year cycle , following Bitcoin’s major losses in 2025. Uncertainties surrounding the fate of Bitcoin spark controversy Regarding the four-year cycle, it is worth noting that the cycle followed trends around halving events in the history of BTC. It also played a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by helping traders forecast future movements. Now that the cycle is losing prominence, analysts suggest that a new trading pattern may be emerging. Interestingly, despite the crypto market being pessimistic, experts still propose that 2026 will be a strong year for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump made it clear that he intends to announce the US Federal Reserve’s new chair in the upcoming weeks. This news sparked hope in the cryptocurrency industry, as many had anticipated that interest rates would decrease. Immediately after those assumptions, the prices of precious metals, such as gold and silver, increased significantly, with both reaching new peaks in the last quarter of 2025. Digital assets, on the other hand, remained unchanged. Analysts are now expressing the likelihood of crucial crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, to provide straightforward regulations and potentially facilitate significant institutional adoption. Several analysts from firms such as Standard Chartered, Strategy, and Bernstein forecast that the price of BTC may reach an all-time high of $150,000 by 2026. Others, like Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who adopted a more positive outlook on the matter, suggested that the cryptocurrency could rise as much as $200,000 to $250,000. Traders point out some of the limitations surrounding BTC’s growth Bitcoin’s price ignited tension in the crypto industry after dropping sharply in November. Analysts claim that some factors could not sustain the cryptocurrency’s price above the $110,000 level. These factors were institutional investments and corporate purchases. They provided various reasons to back this claim. Among these reasons, one key factor raised is the surging interest in Bitcoin options, particularly those related to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. In the meantime, it was confirmed that the total open interest in Bitcoin options escalated from a record of $39 billion noted in December 2024 to a new level in December 2025. Analysts explained that this rise led to heightened awareness of the covered call strategy in the ecosystem. Critics, on the other hand, expressed their belief that by leasing out their anticipated earnings for a fee, major investors have unintentionally set a restriction that halts Bitcoin from attaining its next substantial growth phase. To better understand this point, analysts noted that it is useful to perceive a covered call as an option between earning a higher price and receiving a regular income. Don’t just read crypto news.

This development follows the year-end holiday period when traditional markets closed while cryptocurrency spot trading continued globally. Market analysts now scrutinize this price discrepancy as a potential catalyst for increased volatility during early 2026 trading sessions. Understanding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap represents a measurable price difference between the December 31, 2025 closing price and the January 2, 2026 opening price. Importantly, this gap formed because Bitcoin’s spot market continued trading during the CME’s holiday closure from December 31 through January 1. Consequently, when futures trading resumed, the contract prices adjusted to reflect spot market movements that occurred during the exchange’s inactivity. Daan Crypto Trades, a recognized market analyst, first identified this development through social media platform X. The analyst noted that such gaps typically become focal points for short-term trading strategies. Furthermore, historical data shows that approximately 85% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies significantly based on market conditions. The Mechanics of Futures Market Dislocations CME Bitcoin futures operate on a regulated schedule that differs from cryptocurrency spot markets. While spot exchanges like Coinbase and Binance operate 24/7 throughout the year, traditional derivatives markets observe specific holidays and weekends. This structural difference creates periodic disconnections between derivative and spot prices. Recent Notable CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps Date Gap Size Fill Time Market Context January 2024 $420 3 days Post-ETF approval rally July 2024 $580 14 days Regulatory uncertainty period January 2025 $510 7 days Institutional adoption phase January 2026 $655 TBD Current analysis period Market Implications and Historical Precedents The current $655 gap represents one of the larger January openings in CME Bitcoin futures history. Market participants generally monitor these gaps because they often create technical trading opportunities. Specifically, traders might position themselves to profit from the expected price movement toward the gap fill level. However, the timing remains uncertain and depends on multiple market factors. Historical analysis reveals several important patterns: January gaps tend to fill faster than mid-year gaps, averaging 5.3 days versus 11.7 days Larger gaps (over $500) typically indicate stronger market momentum during the closure period Institutional participation in gap fills has increased steadily since 2023 Volatility spikes often accompany the gap-filling process, particularly during Asian trading hours Expert Perspectives on the 2026 Market Opening Financial analysts emphasize that CME gaps provide valuable information about market sentiment during exchange closures. The $655 discrepancy suggests significant spot market activity occurred while institutional traders couldn’t adjust their futures positions. This situation potentially indicates several market dynamics, including retail-driven movements, geopolitical developments, or algorithmic trading patterns that continued during the holiday period. According to derivatives market specialists, CME Bitcoin futures now represent approximately 35% of all regulated Bitcoin derivatives volume globally. This substantial market share means gaps in CME contracts often influence broader market psychology, even affecting spot prices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The current gap’s size suggests particularly strong momentum developed during the two-day trading hiatus. Technical Analysis and Trading Considerations Traders typically approach CME gaps using specific technical methodologies. The gap area itself often functions as both support and resistance, depending on the gap’s direction. For the current $655 gap, analysts will monitor whether prices move toward filling the gap quickly or if the market establishes new trading ranges above or below the gap zone. Several factors could influence how this situation develops: Volume analysis during the first week of January trading Institutional flows through regulated investment products Global macroeconomic developments affecting risk assets Cryptocurrency-specific news regarding regulation or adoption Market technicians note that gap fills don’t always occur immediately. Sometimes markets establish new trends that leave gaps unfilled for extended periods. However, statistical analysis shows that CME Bitcoin futures gaps under $700 have a 92% fill rate within 30 trading days, based on data from 2020 through 2025. The Regulatory and Institutional Context The CME’s position as a regulated exchange adds significance to these market events. Unlike cryptocurrency-native derivatives platforms, CME operates under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight with traditional market hours and holiday schedules. This regulatory framework attracts institutional participants who may interpret gaps differently than cryptocurrency-native traders. Since the 2023 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the relationship between CME futures and spot markets has strengthened considerably. Many institutional trading desks now use CME futures for hedging ETF exposures, creating additional connections between these market segments. The January 2026 gap therefore reflects not just holiday trading patterns but also evolving institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Global Market Reactions and Comparative Analysis While the CME observed its holiday schedule, other global derivatives markets showed varied responses. European exchanges with different holiday calendars displayed smaller gaps, while Asian markets demonstrated continuous trading throughout the period. This geographic variation in market structure creates arbitrage opportunities that sophisticated traders often exploit during such dislocations. The $655 gap size exceeds most comparable periods in recent years. For context, the average January CME Bitcoin futures gap from 2021-2025 measured $387, making the current development approximately 69% larger than the recent average. This substantial difference suggests unusual market conditions developed during the year-end transition period. Risk Management Perspectives Professional traders emphasize that gap trading carries specific risks. While historical patterns provide guidance, each market situation involves unique variables. Risk managers typically recommend position sizing that accounts for the possibility that gaps may not fill as expected or may take longer than anticipated to resolve. Additionally, the increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and traditional markets adds complexity to gap analysis. During the 2025 holiday period, traditional equity and bond markets also experienced unusual movements that might have influenced cryptocurrency sentiment indirectly through portfolio rebalancing or risk appetite adjustments. Conclusion The $655 CME Bitcoin futures gap forming on the first trading day of 2026 represents a significant market development with implications for short-term volatility and trading strategies. This event highlights the ongoing structural differences between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency trading ecosystems. As institutional participation in cryptocurrency derivatives grows, understanding these market mechanics becomes increasingly important for all market participants. The coming weeks will reveal whether this gap fills quickly or establishes new trading parameters for early 2026. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a CME Bitcoin futures gap? A CME Bitcoin futures gap occurs when there’s a price difference between the closing price before a market holiday and the opening price after the holiday. This happens because Bitcoin’s spot market trades continuously while CME futures have specific trading hours and holidays. Q2: How often do these gaps typically get filled? Historical data from 2020-2025 shows approximately 85-92% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually experience price fills, though the timing varies from immediate to several weeks depending on market conditions and gap size. Q3: Why does the CME have different trading hours than spot cryptocurrency exchanges? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange operates as a traditional regulated financial exchange with set hours and holidays, while cryptocurrency spot markets operate 24/7 globally without traditional market closures. Q4: How does this $655 gap compare to previous years? The $655 gap exceeds the average January gap of $387 from 2021-2025 by approximately 69%, making it one of the larger January openings in recent CME Bitcoin futures history. Q5: What should traders watch regarding this development? Traders typically monitor trading volume, institutional flows, and whether prices begin moving toward the gap level. The speed and manner of any potential gap fill can provide insights into market sentiment and momentum for early 2026.

Index fund flows and passive investing have fundamentally altered market dynamics, making stock-picking more challenging and indexation effects unavoidable. Portfolio allocation size matters more than simple buy/hold/sell labels; conviction and volatility should drive position sizing. Sector movements are increasingly dictated by ETF flows, causing good companies to underperform as index dominance overshadows fundamentals. “Mediocre.” I guess there are many worse things we can be called. I've been called plenty of those in the comments section here, as I approach 2,500 of those answered in 3 years. Quite a journey so far. Thanks to all who have taken the time to read my work during 2025. Mediocre is also how I describe how Bitcoin has performed historically. Does that sound strange, given its monster move earlier this year to an all-time high? Or, due to its even bigger run-up since before most of us knew what cryptocurrency was (or when “staking” was a misspelled way to say, “I'm making steak for dinner”)? Here's what I'm getting at. This is Bitcoin's price since mid-November of 2021. So more than 4 years ago. That's when it touched $60,000. Since that time, it has doubled, and then some, topping out at $126,000 on October 6 of 2025. And now, around $88,000 near year-end 2025, off 30% from that peak, it is up only 34% from where it was more than 49 months ago. So about an 8% annualized return. Data by YCharts The bad news: that's a lot more risk to take on when, as we see below, T-bills earned half that return, despite starting near a 0% rate in late 2021. And the much-maligned non-US segment of the stock market, represented above by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF ( EFA ), had a nice year in 2025, but that followed 3 years of zilch. Yet based only on the strength of a solid past 12 months, EFA's return since that November 2021 starting point now exceeds that of Bitcoin. As we see above, EFA (orange line) and Bitcoin (purple line) took very different directions but ended up at about the same spot. What does this say about Bitcoin's future as an investment? NOTHING. What does it say about perception versus reality when it comes to popular asset types? A LOT. This is why I recently published this table as part of a detailed article on how I'm using 10 ETFs as the current “core” of my Allocation portfolio that I run for investing group members and also share with subscribers at my website. The goal is to coach investors based on my experience allocating through modern market conditions, with risk management at the forefront of everything. ETF Yourself Using Bitcoin to lower risk? You might be surprised to hear “Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT )” and “risk management at the forefront” in the same place. That's the whole idea. To combine asset classes that often exhibit LOW CORRELATION to each other, particularly when markets tank. Look, I get it. Crypto-millionaires and even billionaires are out there. I live close enough to Miami, where many of them now reside, to realize that. But with all investments, there are the early adopters. And while some hit it big, time after time, for many it is more like a strategic “lottery ticket.” The way venture capitalists reportedly fail 90% of the time . But if that one out of 10 takes off, the other 9 are quickly forgotten. Among my other pursuits, I own a partial interest in some racehorses. It's the steadiest part of the game (“claiming”), but it is still a sport in which one win pays for a string of 5th- and 6th-place finishes. The focus here is on the iShares Bitcoin ETF, the largest of its kind. And its relationship to the S&P 500, past and potentially in the future. Because recently, the biggest, most exciting trades of the last few years have started to roll over. But as I recall as a past dog owner, they can flip themselves right back up in a nanosecond. So that's always a possibility. When markets are driven as they are now by algorithms and index fund flows, and nearly every market segment picks a side (are you a risk-on asset or a risk-off asset?), this is something we'll all need to live with as investors. Market indecision is much more common these days. And it leads me to the key factor of position-sizing. Position-sizing: a quick introduction My entire investing process is about this: “Buy/Hold/Sell” are very misleading ways to characterize any investment at any point in time. It says everything about WHAT you are owning or not, but not a thing about HOW MUCH AS A PERCENT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO you are allocating to it. If I have a buy rating on 2 stocks, 1 might be 1% of my portfolio (more volatile, less committed to it, just dipping my toe in for starters). And the other is 5% of my portfolio. That might be because it is much less volatile, and I need to own more to get the dollar return I seek. Or, I might just believe it is an ideal situation (chart-wise, which is my main approach). Now to that IBIT situation and why I have it as a semi-regular spot among 10 ETFs in that allocation portfolio. I've smoothed this out to 3-month rolling returns, with 1-month moving windows. And while IBIT is just reaching 2 years old, the thing with Bitcoin is this: it acts differently with so much ETF money having plowed in. The same can be said for the S&P 500. Data by YCharts Yet in that picture above, I see a pair of ETFs that sometimes rise and fall together but are different in terms of volatility and the potential to move independently of each other. I can't say that about a lot of equity ETFs compared to SPY and about a lot of crypto ETFs compared to IBIT. So for now, they exhibit enough for me to allocate to each, just in varying allocations. Based on their relative attractiveness. These are the basics of diversification. But it is SO MUCH TOUGHER to find nowadays. Thanks to the forces that now move markets. And the jury is still out on Bitcoin's true place in the long-term fabric of the investor's total picture. If you were there more than 10 years ago, congratulations, you are up 15,000%. If you jumped on board 4 years ago, you underperformed much of the stock market. Data by YCharts And if you were one of many who piled in at the start of 2024, when IBIT and 11 other spot Bitcoin ETFs made it easier to own crypto, you are up 87%, comfortably ahead of SPY over that same time. Now, with reference to this chart below, just 3 months ago IBIT led SPY by 168% to 44%. So that margin went from 124% to under 40% in a hurry. Data by YCharts But that again is my point. Stock picking or allocating across many types of stocks via ETFs is not nearly as productive or efficient as it once was. And the IBIT/SPY pair is part of a mountain of evidence supporting that, which grows every day. But since IBIT is still being treated as the nascent asset it is, this is still a good time to consider it. So it made it into my 10-ETF mix, something I frankly was not expecting. That is, until I whittled 4,400 ETFs down to my forced target of only 10. Now, I allocate tactically AMONG the 10 in that table above. I own at least a little of each at all times, as long as it is in the 10. A “permanent portfolio,” if you will. But where are the individual ETFs that make up the 10? While most will stay on the roster for a long time, some will be swapped out. Not when they look unattractive from a short-term return standpoint. When they are no longer providing a diversification benefit, either long-term or short-term. For now, IBIT makes the cut. I can control risk in it with that 2% minimum weighting and control my own excitement toward it (if that happens) with that 10% maximum weighting. And I remind myself that 5% is a “long-term expected average” position for IBIT within the 10 ETF portfolio, though 2% to 10% is the range I'm allowing myself to trade it within. To me, THAT is investing today. Not simply what I own, but how much and how often. Do I like SPY or IBIT better? I like both to different degrees at different times. And in the 10-ETF portfolio, I left SPY out entirely in its cap-weighted form, opting instead to use a mix of QQQ-DIA-RSP, as that trio is much more flexible than SPY alone (separate article on that coming soon). IBIT's technical chart does not look robust, and it is still subject to a combination of big risks. Just ask Michael Saylor (head man at Strategy, symbol MSTR). Those risks include a potential top in crypto enthusiasm, due in part to a peak in market liquidity, as well as repatriation of assets toward home currency assets (China and Japan are doing a lot of that currently). Barchart I've documented SPY's risks here many times for many years. And in its top-heavy form, it still hangs in there, for now. IBIT, SPY, and the bigger portfolio-wide impacts So, why do I make room for at least a 2% allocation to IBIT and also to each of QQQ, DIA, and RSP in that 10-ETF model portfolio? Because: I don't think I'm smarter than the market. I want diversification, but smart diversification, not “I think I'm diversified” diversification, which fails when we need it most. I have a mechanism to produce indicators as to how I want to rotate between those 4 ETFs and the 6 others pictured in the table. My method (ROAR) is not the subject of this article, but it will be in others. And it's there not to be pushed on people, but to show how SOMETHING should be your allocation mechanism. Not just “every 3 months I rebalance.” IBIT allows me to take some shots with small amounts of money, by design. In its brief history, it has had an 80% rally in 3 months and lost more than 25% in 3 months. It's 30% off its high as I write this. 3 months' time! So I expect there to be tactical opportunities to spot in the charts and rotate between that 2% and 10% allocation range. Data by YCharts Finally, using SPY as a proxy for the trio of stock ETFs I use in the 10-ETF portfolio, but the only “offensive weapon” I use in my 2-ETF portfolio (alongside BIL, a T-bill ETF), here's the range of possible outcomes based on the past. Since just before the pandemic, it has shown the potential to move more than 20% in either direction over a 3-month period. Data by YCharts That's a good reason to not set it and forget it, even if US equities are the default anchor of the portfolio. But those defense ETFs are the backstop, something I think more investors should consider the case for in their portfolios. This is all about risk management WHILE pursuing return over all time frames. My goal is to keep drawdowns below 5% and sacrifice some upside at times if that's what it takes. But am I limiting my ability to compete with a traditional “balanced” portfolio over time? Not at all, as I'll continue to discuss here in the new year. Because risk management does not mean capping returns. It means keeping enough capital intact at all times to live to fight another day, or year for that matter.",IBIT|BTC-USD|VOO|IVV|SPY|DIA|DJI|IWM|NDX|QQQ|SP500,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56731714,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258003,1767361211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Shift: Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Bold $30 Million Latin America Exit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitfarms-sells-paraguay-facility-exit/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Shift: Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Bold $30 Million Latin America Exit In a significant strategic pivot, Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms has finalized the $30 million sale of its Paraguay facility, marking a complete withdrawal from Latin American operations and redirecting capital toward emerging technology sectors. This move, announced via GlobeNewswire, signals a broader industry trend where cryptocurrency miners are diversifying their business models beyond pure digital asset production. Consequently, the transaction represents a calculated reallocation of resources in response to evolving market dynamics and technological opportunities. Bitfarms Sells Paraguay Mining Facility in Major Portfolio Restructuring Bitfarms Ltd. has sold its 70-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility in Paso Pe, Paraguay, to Sympatheia Power Fund. The company disclosed the $30 million deal on May 15, 2025. This sale concludes Bitfarms’ operational presence in Latin America. The facility previously contributed to the company’s global hash rate. However, management has decided to reallocate these assets. Therefore, the proceeds will fund new ventures in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). The Paso Pe site began operations in 2022. It leveraged Paraguay’s abundant hydroelectric power. This renewable energy source offered a cost-effective advantage for energy-intensive mining. Nonetheless, the company’s strategic review identified greater potential elsewhere. Subsequently, executives approved the divestment. This decision aligns with a corporate focus on higher-margin infrastructure projects. Moreover, it optimizes the company’s geographical footprint for future growth. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Mining Industry’s Strategic Pivot The Bitcoin mining sector is undergoing a substantial transformation. Historically, companies competed primarily on hash rate and energy cost. Now, many are exploring adjacent technological fields. For instance, HPC and AI data centers require similar infrastructure. They need robust power supplies, advanced cooling, and secure facilities. Consequently, mining firms possess transferable expertise. This industry shift is driven by several key factors. Post-Halving Economics: The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards. This event pressured mining profitability, compelling operational efficiency. Energy Market Volatility: Global energy price fluctuations impact mining margins significantly, encouraging diversification. AI Infrastructure Demand: Demand for AI compute power is surging, creating a lucrative adjacent market for data center operators. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations in various jurisdictions introduce uncertainty, prompting portfolio adjustments. Capital Allocation: Investors increasingly reward diversified technology plays over single-asset commodity producers. This trend is not isolated to Bitfarms. Several other publicly-traded miners have announced similar strategic reviews. They are evaluating existing assets for alternative uses. Therefore, the Bitfarms Paraguay sale is a notable case study in this broader movement. Expert Perspective on Mining Industry Evolution Industry analysts view this move as a logical adaptation. “Mining companies are natural infrastructure operators,” notes a report from Compass Point Research. “Their core competency is managing large-scale, power-hungry computing operations in often remote locations. This skill set translates directly to the burgeoning HPC and AI data center market.” The report further highlights that the capital-intensive nature of mining necessitates constant evaluation of return on invested capital (ROIC). Financial data supports this strategic rationale. A comparison of key metrics illustrates the potential appeal of diversifying revenue streams. Potential Revenue Stream Comparison: Bitcoin Mining vs. AI/HPC Hosting Metric Traditional Bitcoin Mining AI/HPC Infrastructure Hosting Revenue Model Volatile; tied to Bitcoin price & network difficulty Predictable; often long-term contracted service fees Capital Intensity Very High (ASIC hardware) High (GPU/TPU clusters & cooling) Power Cost Sensitivity Extremely High High, but often passed through in contracts Hardware Lifespan ~3-4 years before obsolescence ~4-5 years, with more upgrade flexibility Regulatory Scrutiny Increasing globally Established and generally stable This comparative analysis shows why diversification is attractive. AI infrastructure offers more stable, contracted revenue. It also faces different regulatory pressures. Therefore, Bitfarms’ pivot aims to build a more resilient business model. The Future Focus: High-Performance Computing and AI Energy Infrastructure Bitfarms plans to reinvest the $30 million from the Paraguay sale. The capital will develop high-performance computing and AI-based energy infrastructure. Company executives have outlined a clear vision. They intend to leverage their existing expertise in large-scale electrical and thermal management. This expertise is critical for modern data centers. Specifically, AI training clusters generate immense heat. Efficient cooling solutions are paramount. Mining firms have years of experience solving this problem. The company’s existing facilities in the United States and Canada are potential candidates for conversion. These sites already have secured power contracts and robust grid connections. Furthermore, they are located in regions with supportive policies for technology investment. Redeveloping a portion of these sites for HPC could happen relatively quickly. This approach allows for a phased transition. It also mitigates risk by maintaining some Bitcoin mining revenue during the build-out. This strategic direction receives support from market forecasts. Demand for AI compute is projected to grow exponentially through the decade. Firms providing the physical infrastructure for this demand are well-positioned. Consequently, Bitfarms is entering a competitive but high-growth market. Their differentiator will be proven experience in managing megawatt-scale computing operations reliably and efficiently. Conclusion The sale of the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility represents a strategic inflection point for the company and reflects a wider evolution within the cryptocurrency mining industry. By exiting Latin America and reallocating $30 million toward high-performance computing and AI infrastructure, Bitfarms is proactively adapting to post-halving economics and capitalizing on the explosive demand for artificial intelligence compute capacity. This pivot highlights the increasing convergence between digital asset infrastructure and the broader technology sector, as firms leverage their core operational competencies to secure future growth in adjacent, high-value markets. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitfarms sell its Paraguay facility? Bitfarms sold the facility as part of a strategic shift to reallocate capital from pure Bitcoin mining toward developing infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence, aiming for more diversified and potentially stable revenue streams. Q2: Who purchased the Bitfarms Paraguay mining facility? The 70 MW facility in Paso Pe was purchased by Sympatheia Power Fund for a total of $30 million, as reported by GlobeNewswire. Q3: Does this sale mean Bitfarms is exiting Bitcoin mining entirely? No, the sale marks an exit from Latin America, but Bitfarms continues its Bitcoin mining operations in other regions, such as the United States and Canada. The move is a portfolio optimization, not a full exit from the industry. Q4: What is high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure? HPC and AI infrastructure refers to the specialized data centers that house powerful computing clusters (like GPUs and TPUs) used for complex tasks such as scientific research, data analysis, and training artificial intelligence models. These facilities require massive amounts of power and advanced cooling, similar to Bitcoin mining farms. Q5: How might this strategic shift affect Bitfarms’ future financial performance? The shift could lead to a more diversified revenue model with longer-term contracts from HPC/AI hosting, potentially reducing volatility compared to earnings solely dependent on Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty. However, success depends on execution and competition in the new market.

YBTC’s holdings are primarily US Treasury bills, with complex options positions rather than traditional covered calls on Bitcoin ETFs. We go over the return profile to illustrate why most covered call funds don't pass our tests. Today, we will focus on Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). According to their website, this is what it does. The Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF is the first U.S. listed bitcoin covered call ETF. 1 The Fund offers exposure to exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) that have direct exposure to bitcoin * , subject to a cap, while providing the potential for current income. YBTC is an actively-managed ETF. Source: Roundhill The fund does not directly ""invest"" (we have to use the quotes here) in Bitcoin but uses exchange-traded products. When we read that, we thought it might just hold a Bitcoin ETF and then sell calls on that. You probably thought the same. Instead, when we examine the holdings, they present a drastically different picture. YBTC Their current AUM is around $224 million, so the entire AUM is invested in US Treasury bills. A tiny portion is also invested in Government Treasury mutual fund ($143,176), and some is held as cash ($798,464). The actual bitcoin-related holdings are strange, to say the least. Here's the first one. YBTC This appears to be a purchased call option. Normally with covered call funds, you would expect to see the underlying ETF, which in this case is iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), and then a call sold. So this would then appear with a negative sign. A purchased call is the opposite of what you would expect these funds to do. This is also right at the money ($49.72 strike) and close to expiration (Jan 16, 2026). Seeking Alpha So if Bitcoin stays here, the entire premium evaporates. That would be a 3.4% loss in one month on equity/AUM. But it gets more interesting. Against that purchased call, there is a sold call. This expires on January 2, 2026, and is of a higher strike price of $51.30. YBTC So the fund has created a long calendar call spread. Not something you would see in a typical covered call fund. This then brings us to our final position, which is one where significant premiums are sold. The fund has 45,048 contracts of the $49.72 put. YBTC For those that are unaware, cash-secured puts are identical to covered calls, adjusted for market interest rates. So if you sell a cash-secured put and in the interim park your money in a Treasury bill, you should get the same return profile as buying the stock and selling the identical strike covered call. There are some nuances depending on dividends and early exercise probabilities, but that all is not something we have to even think about with Bitcoin. So the overall position here is strange in some ways, as the fund did cash-secured puts for Bitcoin and then used that money to buy calls, partially offset by a calendar spread. Of course this is all just a moment in time, so we have no idea how this strategy has been changed over the course of the fund's history. What we do have is the pudding, where we can look for the proof. The Pudding If you run the price return profiles of IBIT and YBTC, you get a rather glaring contrast. Data by YCharts Of course the investor is now going, ""Wait, you didn't count my fat dividend checks."" We get that, and we will get to that. We always like to see this part first, as it gets to this decay principle where funds struggle to make the same dollars they did on day one as their NAV goes down. Now, there are some income investors who feel the rules of math don't apply. They seem to believe a fund with a $100 NAV per share can generate the same income even after its NAV drops 50%. But we made it past fourth grade (on the second attempt), so that is not a problem for us. Getting back to the total returns, we see that YBTC has been a real problem child here, lagging IBIT by a lot since inception. Data by YCharts That is a lot of ground to give up. The truly fascinating aspect about this fund is that it has delivered worse total returns in the recent bear market. Data by YCharts That's right. The fund has actually lagged IBIT during a rather steep drop. Verdict You couldn't pay us to speculate on Bitcoin. But if you are doing that, buy Bitcoin or IBIT and do your own covered calls. There are ways to do this intelligently that reduce your risk and improve your returns. Funds focused on generating income tend to miss the forest for the trees. There is too much emphasis on selling premiums rather than asking whether it is the right time to sell premiums. At the minimum, such funds should outperform strongly during bear markets to justify the loss of upside. You have to deliver on Sharpe if you can't deliver on Beta. Based on our opinion on Bitcoin and covered call funds and the data we have seen on this fund, we rate this a Strong Sell. Please note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult a professional who knows their objectives and constraints.

The company said it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with Sympatheia Power Fund, which is managed by Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. The transaction is expected to close within 60 days, subject to customary closing conditions. Refocus on North American HPC and AI Infrastructure Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon said the sale represents a decisive rebalancing of the company’s energy portfolio toward North America, allowing capital to be redeployed into higher-return opportunities. “This transaction brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations to be reinvested into our North American HPC and AI energy infrastructure in 2026,” Gagnon said in a press release. He added that the sale of the Paso Pe site marks the culmination of a broader effort to exit Latin America and refocus the company’s management capital and operational priorities on North American power and infrastructure. Bitfarms Ditches BTC for AI After Shocking $46M Loss Bitfarms said it has increasingly positioned itself as an energy and digital infrastructure company expanding beyond bitcoin mining into high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, which it believes offer more long-term returns on invested capital. In November, the company said it will wind down its Bitcoin operations over 2026 and 2027 after posting a steep $46 million loss in the third quarter, nearly double its $24 million loss during the same period last year. @Bitfarms_io shares dropped 18% as it announced a wind-down in $BTC operations to pivot to AI infrastructure after a $46M Q3 loss. #Bitcoin #AI https://t.co/3Q7tsldFzS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2025 Deal Structure and Payment Timeline Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer will acquire the shares of a single-purpose subsidiary that holds all operating assets related to the Paso Pe project. The proposed transaction values the site at up to $30 million. Bitfarms expects to receive $9 million in cash at closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. This amount includes a $1 million non-refundable deposit that has already been paid by the buyer. The company may receive up to an additional $21 million over the ten months following closing, contingent on the achievement of certain payment milestones. The structure of the transaction is expected to improve Bitfarms’ liquidity profile by accelerating the monetization of the asset while providing short-term financing supported by the operation. Buyer Targets Operational Continuity A representative for Sympatheia Power Fund said the acquisition supports the fund’s regional expansion strategy in crypto infrastructure and emphasized the importance of a smooth transition. “Our priority is an uninterrupted, seamless transition from day one, maintaining continuity at Paso Pe as we move into the next phase of growth,” said SPF representative Josh Murchie. Updated Energy Portfolio Post-Sale Following completion of the transaction, Bitfarms’ energy portfolio will be entirely North America–based. The company said it will operate 341 megawatts of energized capacity with an additional 430 megawatts under active development in the United States. Its total multi-year pipeline stands at 2.1 gigawatts, with roughly 90% located in the U.S. The post Bitfarms to Exit Latin America Selling 70 MW Paraguay Mining Site for Up to $30M appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitfarms|Mining|Paraguay,BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Traders on Polymarket appear cautious, while some big-name firms keep calling for big gains in 2026. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Market Odds And Trader Caution According to Polymarket prices, Bitcoin has just a 23% chance of reaching $150,000 before 2027. The odds are higher at lower targets: 47% for $120,000, 35% for $130,000 and 29% for $140,000. Traders are most comfortable with $100,000, which carries about an 80% chance. That spread shows bettors are pricing risk tightly as the clock runs toward the new year. Bitcoin closed 2025 in the red, a fact that has likely cooled some enthusiasm. Reports have disclosed that gold and silver hit fresh highs in the fourth quarter of 2025, while crypto prices held mostly flat. The old four-year halving cycle that many chartists relied on is being questioned, and that doubt is being priced in. Technical Signals Based on the latest Bitcoin price outlook, BTC is expected to climb 3% to about $91,815 by February 1, 2026. Technical signals point to a Bearish mood, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 28, reflecting Fear. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin posted gains on 15 of those days, or 50%, with price swings averaging 2%. Policy Shifts Could Change The Math US President Donald Trump is expected to name a new Federal Reserve chair soon, and many market participants are betting that interest rates will be cut afterward. That idea has already helped send precious metals higher. At the same time, regulators in Washington are pushing crypto bills such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, which backers say could give clearer rules and, in time, more institutional interest. Analysts Still Offer Bullish Targets Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly predicted that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of 2026, citing stronger institutional interest and better regulatory clarity as reasons for his bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bear Market Might Not Be New: Data Points To A 2-Month Slide Analysts at JPMorgan have suggested a theoretical Bitcoin price around $170,000 in 2026, based on a model comparing Bitcoin’s behavior to gold and assuming continued capital flows into the crypto market. Grayscale’s 2026 digital asset outlook expects Bitcoin to exceed its previous all-time high in the first half of 2026, implying a move above its record peak of around $126,000 (though not giving a specific numerical target, the implication is toward significant upward momentum). Policymakers, traders and analysts are all weighing different risks. Market prices reflect caution today, while forecasts offer a brighter view for the months ahead. Which one proves right will depend on policy moves, investor appetite and whether new trading patterns replace the cycle many thought they could count on.

The pledge arrives as South Korea’s financial regulator and central bank remain locked in a prolonged dispute over stablecoin issuance rules that have pushed comprehensive digital asset legislation into next year. According to the local report, Jeong told attendees at the Korea Exchange’s Seoul headquarters that new investment products, including virtual asset ETFs and derivatives, would be introduced as part of efforts to overcome the “ Korea Discount ” and upgrade the capital market. He also committed to deploying AI-based monitoring systems and strengthening crackdowns on stock manipulation through a joint response team. Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo. | Source: Yonhap Korea Exchange Ready, Regulators Still Divided The Korea Exchange’s readiness to launch crypto products contrasts sharply with regulatory delays that have stretched back years. The Financial Services Commission submitted a roadmap in June proposing spot crypto ETFs for late 2025, but the plan has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, South Korea’s comprehensive Digital Asset Basic Act remains stalled in 2026 after the Financial Services Commission and Bank of Korea failed to reach an agreement on stablecoin governance . The central bank insists that stablecoins should be issued only by bank-led consortia, with lenders holding at least a 51% ownership stake. The FSC has resisted the fixed threshold, warning it could sideline technology firms and slow innovation in digital payments. Regulators also disagree on whether a new licensing committee is needed for stablecoin oversight. Beyond stablecoins, the draft law would introduce strict investor protections, including full-reserve custody requirements, and raise compliance standards for crypto service providers to match those in traditional finance. Initial coin offerings banned since 2017 could return under strict disclosure rules. Stablecoin issuers would be required to hold reserves entirely in bank deposits or government bonds, with 100% of those reserves entrusted to licensed custodians. South Korea’s comprehensive crypto law has been delayed to 2026 due to a dispute over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/jKP9L9n63S — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 The regulatory impasse continues despite strong political momentum from President Lee Jae-myung’s administration, which campaigned on easing digital asset restrictions. The ruling Democratic Party introduced legislation in June to amend the Capital Markets Act, expanding the definition of underlying assets for ETFs to include Bitcoin and other digital currencies. A separate bill proposed legalizing stablecoin issuance by domestic firms with a minimum capital of 500 million won. However, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has opposed the development of non-bank stablecoins due to monetary policy concerns. Enforcement Drive Continues Across Major Exchanges While policy debates drag on, enforcement actions have accelerated. The Financial Intelligence Unit imposed a ₩27.3 billion fine on Korbit in late December following approximately 22,000 anti-money laundering violations identified during October inspections. The regulator found failures in customer identification, unauthorized transactions with unregistered overseas platforms, and inadequate money-laundering risk assessments for new products. The Korbit penalty followed earlier sanctions against Upbit operator Dunamu, which received a three-month suspension on new customer accounts in February and a ₩35.2 billion fine in November. Bithumb, Coinone, and GOPAX remain under review as the FIU works through cases in inspection order, with total fines across the sector expected to reach hundreds of billions of won. South Korea is set to hit major crypto exchanges with new penalties over anti-money laundering failures, signaling a tougher enforcement phase for the industry. #SouthKorea #CryptoAML https://t.co/9r42trYMmE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 Authorities are simultaneously expanding transaction monitoring requirements. The same late last month, a task force led by the FIU is reviewing whether to extend the travel rule to cover crypto transfers below 1 million won, closing a gap regulators say has enabled smurfing techniques used to evade reporting thresholds. The proposed changes would require exchanges to collect sender and recipient information for all virtual asset transfers, regardless of size. Mixed Signals From Financial Authorities The regulatory uncertainty has created contradictory guidance for asset managers. In July, the Financial Supervisory Service issued verbal warnings restricting the proportion of crypto-related stocks , such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, in domestic ETF portfolios, citing administrative guidance from 2017 that remains in effect. Several Korean ETFs already hold double-digit allocations to these companies through passive index tracking. However, industry participants argued that the restrictions create unfair advantages for US-listed crypto products while failing to prevent capital outflows. “Restricting only domestic ETFs will not stop the flow of funds, and in reality, many investors are already bypassing the market with U.S. ETFs,” one source noted at the time.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,750, meaning it closed the year 2025 below $100,000. This price action has added pressure to sentiment, and higher-timeframe indicators are pointing to growing exhaustion. According to a 3-month candlestick analysis shared on X by analyst Greeny, the way Bitcoin closed 2025 may carry deeper implications than most traders currently understand. 3-Month Bearish Engulfing Points To Weakness Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe shows the cryptocurrency just printed a large bearish engulfing candle that fully overtook the prior quarterly advance. This type of candle is rare on such a high timeframe and typically points to a decisive shift in control from buyers to sellers. The chart shared by Greeny shows that this engulfing structure formed after Bitcoin failed to hold above its 2025 highs above $120,000 in October, and this shows that the year ended in distribution. Interestingly, $106,700 is now an important level moving forward because it corresponds with the bottom of the previous 3-month candle. With Bitcoin now trading below that zone, it flips from support into a heavy resistance area for price action in Q1. Any recovery attempt in early 2026 would need to reclaim this level convincingly to avoid further rejection. Furthermore, the stochastic level near $108,000 is another important level to look at for Bitcoin’s price action in Q1 2026. According to Greeny, if the Bitcoin price closes below this zone after the first quarter, it would indicate continued downside pressure. Together, these levels form a tight ceiling overhead, meaning even strong relief rallies could struggle to transition into sustainable uptrends as we move into the new year. Bitcoin 3-month Candlestick Price Chart: @greenytrades on X Stochastic Exhaustion Points To A Possible Cycle Peak Another concerning element of Greeny’s analysis centers on the stochastic indicator. According to the analyst, this is the first time in Bitcoin’s history that the stochastic has reached the 80th percentile on the 3-month timeframe. This is otherwise notable because this is a zone generally associated with exhaustion and a local or bull cycle top. The chart also shows the red moving average crossing above the blue while sitting well below the stochastic band, a configuration Greeny interprets as confirmation of a local top. This setup is likely pointing to the end of the current bull cycle and will only be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to close above $108,000 by the end of March. Liquidity conditions across the entire crypto market tightened through late 2025 as the Central Bank of Japan maintained higher interest rates. This has led to Bitcoin underperforming compared to other notable assets, while precious metals such as gold and silver pushed to new price highs.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Historically, every Bitcoin $BTC death cross between the 10W and 50W SMA has led to a major correction: • Sep 2014: –67% • Jun 2018: –54% • Mar 2020: –53% • Jan 2022: –64% https://t.co/EWSDQeujJt pic.twitter.com/CEGle2ExXd — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 2, 2026 Simultaneously, Martinez explained he expects that a Bitcoin correction to between $38,000 and $50,000 – between 57% and 44% from the press time value – is likely. Still, the trading expert also noted with his BTC prediction that, rather than a purely detrimental situation, such a crash would once again turn Bitcoin into an attractive long-term investment. The pullback would all but ensure that the cryptocurrency’s upside potential is significantly greater than the downward pressure. Top commodity strategist forecasts massive 2026 Bitcoin crash On the other hand, hopeful BTC traders might have to wait until at least 2027 to again witness a major rally. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s senior commodity analyst, explained that he expects Bitcoin might crash toward $50,000 in 2026. He also revealed that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index – an index designed to serve as a benchmark for the cryptocurrency market – fell 19% in 2025, hinting at a more persistent downtrend. Bitcoin just broke a decade-long cycle Lastly, Bitcoin’s actual performance for the entire 2025 also indicates that the boom is, for the time being, over. Simultaneously, it showcased that the cryptocurrency market might be even harder to predict in the future. BTC 12-month price chart.

This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling discussions about its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this rally, from macroeconomic shifts to institutional adoption trends. Bitcoin Price Breaches a Critical Threshold The ascent of the Bitcoin price above $90,000 marks a new chapter in its volatile history. This movement is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of sustained buying pressure observed over recent weeks. Data from multiple trading platforms confirms the breakout, with Binance’s USDT pair serving as a key liquidity benchmark for the global market. Furthermore, this price action follows a period of consolidation below previous resistance levels, suggesting a fundamental shift in market sentiment. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a pattern of reaching round-number milestones that later become support zones. The journey from $70,000 to this new high involved navigating regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data releases, and shifting investor risk appetites. For instance, the asset’s performance often correlates inversely with traditional market fears, positioning it as a potential hedge for some portfolios. Therefore, the breach of $90,000 is being analyzed through both technical chart patterns and broader economic narratives. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Several interconnected factors are contributing to the current cryptocurrency rally. Primarily, renewed institutional interest has provided substantial buy-side volume. Major asset managers have continued to expand their digital asset offerings, channeling traditional capital into the space. Simultaneously, macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about currency devaluation and inflation in certain regions, have driven retail and institutional investors toward scarce digital assets. Institutional Adoption: Increased integration by payment processors and treasury allocations by public companies. Macroeconomic Hedge: Perceived as a digital store of value amid expansive fiscal policies. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements to the Bitcoin protocol enhancing its utility and security. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in key jurisdictions providing a more stable framework for investment. Moreover, the supply dynamics of Bitcoin play a crucial role. The predictable, diminishing rate of new coin issuance—a process known as the halving—creates a built-in scarcity mechanism. As adoption increases against this constrained supply, basic economic principles of supply and demand exert upward pressure on the Bitcoin price. This fundamental aspect distinguishes it from traditional fiat currencies and remains a core tenet of its investment thesis. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of volume and derivative market positioning in assessing the rally’s health. Notably, open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen alongside the price, but funding rates have remained relatively neutral. This suggests a balance between long and short positions, potentially indicating a healthier, less speculative advance compared to past parabolic moves. Experts from major financial research firms point to on-chain data, such as the growth in long-term holder supply and low exchange reserves, as signs of strong conviction among investors. Comparatively, the current rally exhibits distinct characteristics from the 2021 bull market. The table below outlines key differences: Market Aspect 2021 Cycle 2025 Cycle (Current) Primary Drivers Retail frenzy, meme coins, excessive leverage Institutional inflows, ETF products, macroeconomic narrative Leverage Levels Extremely High Moderate to High Regulatory Environment Highly uncertain Evolving with clearer frameworks On-chain Holder Behavior High exchange inflows Accumulation & withdrawal to cold storage This shift in market structure implies a potentially more mature and stable foundation for current price levels. However, analysts universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Risk management, therefore, is paramount for all market participants. The Ripple Effect Across Digital Asset Markets The breakthrough in the Bitcoin price invariably influences the broader digital asset ecosystem. Often termed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s performance frequently sets the tone for altcoins and other blockchain-based assets. In this instance, the rally has restored overall market capitalization to levels not seen in years, improving liquidity and investor confidence across the board. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have often shown correlated momentum, though the strength of this correlation can vary based on independent network developments. Simultaneously, the infrastructure surrounding cryptocurrency continues to evolve rapidly. Custodial services, regulatory-compliant exchanges, and financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs have created more accessible pathways for traditional capital. This institutional gateway effect is a critical component of the current market phase, differentiating it from earlier cycles dominated primarily by retail traders on less regulated platforms. The growing integration with legacy finance presents both opportunities for growth and new complexities regarding systemic interconnectedness. Conclusion The Bitcoin price surpassing $90,000 is a definitive milestone, reflecting a complex interplay of adoption, macroeconomics, and technological maturity. This achievement underscores Bitcoin’s persistent resilience and its growing absorption into the broader financial conversation. While volatility remains a defining feature, the market’s underlying structure appears to be evolving toward greater participation and sophistication. Ultimately, the journey toward and beyond this price point will be closely watched as a barometer for the entire digital asset class’s integration into the global economic system. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $90,040 on Binance USDT mean? This means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin (BTC) can be purchased or sold for 90,040 Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is a key pricing pair that reflects real-time global supply and demand. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin’s price is rising? Primary drivers include increased institutional investment through new financial products, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, continued adoption as a payment method, and its fixed, scarce supply schedule which contrasts with expansive monetary policy. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s current rally compare to 2021? The current rally appears more institutionally driven, with significant capital flowing through regulated ETFs and corporate treasuries. In contrast, the 2021 peak was characterized by higher retail leverage and excitement around meme coins and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Q4: Is Bitcoin’s price sustainable at this level? Sustainability depends on continued adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. While on-chain data and institutional interest provide a stronger foundation now, cryptocurrency markets are still young and subject to high volatility and unpredictable corrections. Q5: What is the impact of Bitcoin’s price on other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the overall market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin price typically increases capital flows into the entire crypto sector, boosting the prices of major altcoins. However, individual project fundamentals ultimately determine long-term performance relative to Bitcoin.

This surprising turn of events, reported by DL News in early 2025, follows his November 2024 sentencing to five years for orchestrating one of cryptocurrency’s most infamous thefts. Consequently, his release under the U.S. First Step Act raises profound questions about justice, rehabilitation, and the evolving legal landscape for digital asset crimes. Bitfinex Hacker Early Release Details and Legal Mechanism The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Ilya Lichtenstein’s early release this week. Authorities applied provisions of the First Step Act of 2018. This bipartisan federal law specifically aims to reduce recidivism. Furthermore, it promotes inmate rehabilitation through earned time credits. Lichtenstein reportedly qualified for these credits by participating in prison programming. His original five-year sentence stemmed from a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges connected directly to the 2016 Bitfinex security breach. Prosecutors originally charged Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, in February 2022. Their arrest followed a multi-year investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Agents traced the movement of 119,754 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the theft, the cryptocurrency was worth approximately $71 million. However, by the time of their arrest, its value had ballooned to a staggering $4.5 billion. This case remains one of the largest financial seizures in U.S. history. The 2016 Bitfinex Breach and Investigation Timeline Understanding the early release requires examining the original crime’s scale. The Bitfinex hack occurred on August 2, 2016. Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the exchange’s multi-signature wallet service. They successfully initiated over 2,000 unauthorized transactions. These transactions drained customer and corporate funds. The exchange immediately suspended all trading. It also announced a 36% socialized loss across all user accounts. For nearly six years, the stolen funds remained dormant. Then, in 2022, blockchain analytics and traditional investigative work converged. The IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Cyber Crimes Unit and HSI followed a complex trail. They linked the funds to wallets controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. A court-authorized search of their cloud storage accounts revealed private keys. These keys directly accessed the wallets holding the stolen Bitcoin. Key Events in the Bitfinex Case Date Event Aug 2, 2016 Bitfinex hack occurs; 119,754 BTC stolen. Feb 8, 2022 Lichtenstein and Morgan arrested in New York. Aug 2022 Both plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy. Nov 2024 Lichtenstein sentenced to 5 years in prison. Early 2025 Early release granted under First Step Act. The investigation showcased unprecedented collaboration. Agencies combined blockchain forensic tools with classic financial sleuthing. This approach set a new standard for prosecuting cryptocurrency crimes. First Step Act Provisions and Application to Cybercrime The First Step Act represents a significant shift in federal sentencing policy. Its primary goals include: Reducing mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenses. Expanding early release programs through earned time credits. Increasing rehabilitation programming within federal prisons. Improving conditions and reducing recidivism rates. Inmates earn credits by participating in Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) programs. These programs address needs like vocational training, education, and substance abuse treatment. Lichtenstein’s eligibility suggests he engaged with such programming. The Act does not distinguish between crime types for credit eligibility. Therefore, non-violent financial crimes like money laundering qualify. This application to a high-profile cybercrime case is particularly noteworthy. Impact on Cryptocurrency Security and Legal Precedents Lichtenstein’s early release sends ripples through the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, it tests the deterrent effect of prosecution for digital asset theft. Secondly, it highlights the tension between punishment and rehabilitation for technical crimes. The case already established several key legal precedents: Asset Forfeiture: The government successfully seized and sold billions in stolen crypto. Jurisdiction: U.S. courts asserted authority over crimes involving globally dispersed digital assets. Investigation Methods: The use of blockchain analytics as evidence gained judicial acceptance. Security experts note the hack forced major exchanges to overhaul their protocols. Today, most leading platforms use sophisticated cold storage solutions. They also employ multi-party computation (MPC) for key management. The Bitfinex incident remains a cautionary tale for the entire industry. Expert Analysis on Sentencing and Release Legal scholars specializing in cyberlaw offer critical perspectives. Professor Elena Carter of Stanford Law School notes, “The First Step Act focuses on rehabilitation for non-violent offenders. The court likely viewed the technical nature of the crime as non-violent, despite its massive financial scale.” Meanwhile, blockchain forensic analyst David Chen observes, “This early release doesn’t diminish the investigative breakthrough. The real victory was tracing and recovering the funds, which returned value to victims.” The case also involved Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, a rapper and entrepreneur. She received a shorter sentence and was released earlier. Their combined story of tech savvy, money laundering through complex transactions, and unconventional public personas captured global media attention. Conclusion The early release of Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein under the First Step Act concludes a landmark chapter in cryptocurrency legal history. This case demonstrated the formidable reach of U.S. law enforcement into the blockchain. It also tested new sentencing reforms on a high-stakes financial crime. Ultimately, the recovery of $4.5 billion in stolen assets stands as the investigation’s enduring legacy. The industry now watches how this precedent influences future prosecutions of digital asset theft and money laundering. FAQs Q1: What was the First Step Act, and why did it apply to Ilya Lichtenstein? The First Step Act is a 2018 U.S. federal law designed to reform sentencing and promote inmate rehabilitation. It applied to Lichtenstein because he qualified for earned time credits by participating in prison programming aimed at reducing recidivism, and his crime was classified as non-violent. Q2: How much Bitcoin was originally stolen in the 2016 Bitfinex hack? The hackers stole 119,754 Bitcoin from Bitfinex in August 2016. At the time of the theft, this was worth about $71 million. By the time of the arrest in 2022, the value had appreciated to approximately $4.5 billion. Q3: What happened to the stolen Bitcoin after the seizure? The U.S. government successfully seized the vast majority of the stolen Bitcoin. It then sold portions of the cryptocurrency through authorized auctions and market sales. The proceeds are held as recovered assets, with processes in place for potential victim restitution. Q4: How does this early release affect future cryptocurrency crime prosecutions? Legal experts believe the core precedent—successful investigation, seizure, and conviction—remains intact. The early release reflects sentencing policy, not investigative failure. It may, however, influence plea negotiations and sentencing arguments in future digital asset cases. Q5: What role did Ilya Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, play in the crime? Heather Morgan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and defraud the United States. Prosecutors alleged she helped launder the stolen funds through complex transactions, shell companies, and false invoices. She received a sentence shorter than Lichtenstein’s and was released earlier.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,961.21 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This sudden Bitcoin price movement has captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, prompting a deep dive into the underlying market mechanics and historical context. The drop represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and introduces fresh volatility into the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The descent below $89,000 marks a clear technical breakdown. Consequently, market participants are now scrutinizing order book liquidity and exchange flows. Major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken show similar price action, confirming a broad-based sell-off. Furthermore, the 24-hour trading volume has spiked by approximately 35%, indicating heightened activity. This Bitcoin price decline follows a period of consolidation just above the $90,000 psychological barrier. Market data reveals increased selling pressure from large wallet addresses, often called ‘whales.’ Historically, such movements often correlate with broader financial conditions. For instance, the current macroeconomic backdrop includes shifting expectations around central bank policies. Analysts frequently compare present volatility to past cycles, like the Q2 2024 correction. A short-term sell-off can sometimes establish a stronger foundation for future growth. Therefore, understanding the immediate catalysts is crucial for a complete market picture. Technical Indicators and On-Chain Data Key technical levels provide further insight into the Bitcoin price trajectory. The 50-day moving average, a closely watched metric, now acts as dynamic resistance. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory. On-chain analytics from Glassnode show a net outflow from exchanges, suggesting some investors are moving holdings to cold storage. This ‘hodling’ behavior often signals long-term conviction despite short-term price pain. The network’s hash rate remains robust, underscoring fundamental security strength. Analyzing Potential Catalysts for the Decline Several interrelated factors may have contributed to this cryptocurrency market downturn. First, regulatory developments continue to create uncertainty in major economies. Second, profit-taking after a sustained rally above $85,000 was a widely anticipated risk. Third, movements in traditional markets, like bond yields or equity indices, can trigger correlated sell-offs in digital assets. Finally, leveraged positions being liquidated on derivatives exchanges can exacerbate downward momentum. It is essential to distinguish between causation and correlation. For example, not every market move has a single, identifiable news trigger. Often, a confluence of minor factors creates the conditions for a shift. Market sentiment, measured by tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, had been in ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. A reversion to a more neutral or fearful reading is a common market-clearing event. Macroeconomic Pressure: Shifts in inflation data or interest rate expectations. Overleveraged Markets: Cascade of long position liquidations on futures platforms. Regulatory Headlines: News flow concerning digital asset legislation or enforcement actions. Profit-Taking: Natural sell pressure after a multi-week appreciation cycle. Historical Volatility and Bitcoin Market Cycles Bitcoin’s history is defined by volatility. A pullback of 5-15% during a bull market phase is statistically normal. For context, the 2021 cycle saw over a dozen corrections exceeding 10% before reaching its all-time high. This perspective helps investors maintain a long-term view. The current Bitcoin price action fits within established patterns of advance, consolidation, and correction. Seasoned analysts often view these dips as potential entry points rather than signals of a trend reversal, provided core fundamentals remain intact. Comparing asset classes highlights Bitcoin’s unique risk profile. Traditional safe-haven assets like gold typically exhibit lower volatility. However, Bitcoin’s potential for asymmetric returns attracts a different investor profile. The digital gold narrative persists, but its trading patterns remain distinct. This latest move serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent price discovery process, which is often volatile and inefficient. Expert Commentary and Market Sentiment Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize context. ‘Market corrections are healthy,’ notes a veteran trader from a major digital asset fund. ‘They flush out weak leverage and reset derivatives markets.’ Another analyst points to on-chain metrics showing accumulation by long-term holders during dips. This behavior suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Sentiment on social trading platforms has quickly shifted from bullish to cautious, reflecting the fast-paced nature of crypto markets. Impact on the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The Bitcoin price decline has a pronounced ripple effect. Altcoins, which often correlate with BTC, have generally moved in tandem, with some experiencing more severe losses. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dipped accordingly. However, this correlation sometimes decouples, with select projects showcasing independent strength. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) trading volumes may see secondary impacts if the downturn persists. Institutional investment flows, tracked through products like Bitcoin ETFs, will be a key metric to watch in the coming days. Sustained inflows during a price drop could signal strong institutional conviction. Conversely, outflows might indicate a broader risk-off move. The interaction between spot market selling and derivatives market liquidations creates a complex feedback loop that analysts will study closely. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $89,000 represents a significant moment in the 2025 market cycle. This movement underscores the volatile and interconnected nature of digital asset markets. While short-term price action captures headlines, the long-term narrative around Bitcoin’s adoption, technological development, and role as a digital store of value remains multifaceted. Investors are advised to focus on risk management, fundamental research, and a time horizon that aligns with their financial goals. The coming days will be critical for observing whether this level holds as support or if further downside exploration occurs. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $89,000? The decline likely resulted from a combination of profit-taking after a rally, liquidations of leveraged long positions, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. It is a typical correction within a volatile market. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual strategy. Some view corrections as potential buying opportunities, but timing the market is notoriously difficult. Conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q3: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major altcoins have high correlation with Bitcoin and often move in the same direction, at least in the short term. The entire crypto market cap typically reacts to significant BTC movements. Q4: What key level should traders watch next? Traders are monitoring the $88,000 and $85,000 levels as potential next supports. A reclaim of $90,000 would be viewed as a bullish signal for a potential recovery. Q5: Does this price drop change Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? A single price correction rarely alters long-term fundamental theses based on adoption, scarcity, and utility. Volatility is an inherent feature of the asset class, and long-term investors often look through short-term fluctuations.

Bitfarms is a mid-range mining company with 19.5 EH/s in total BTC mining power. The company is also within the top 100 of BTC treasury holders, retaining 1,827 BTC from its mining activity. The Paraguay center will go toward Sympatheia Power Fund’s expansion plans for Latin America. The mining center will retain operations, with no outages during the transfer of ownership. Bitfarms sells BTC mining center for $30M Bitfarms will sell the Paso Pe BTC mining facility at a $30M valuation, with $9M in cash and up to $21M over a 10-month period. After the deal, Bitfarms will focus solely on North American energy assets while improving its liquidity profile for further expansion. Bitfarms negotiated a $300M long-term debt facility in April 2025 as part of its energy expansion plans. Bitfarms retains 341 MW in energy capacity, with another 430 MW in active development. The multi-year plan is to reach a total of 2.1 GW in data centers, of which 90% will be based in the USA. Bitfarms has been on an expansion track since 2017, and is one of the leaders in North American mining infrastructure. Bitfarms benefits from AI data center boom The sale arrives at a time when Bitcoin mining operations are often converted to high-uptime AI centers, based on existing contracts for reliable electricity. Following the deal announcement, BITF shares were trading at $2.96 (3.93 CAD), up over 32% net for the past year. The period coincided with revenue growth for BITF, as the miner benefited from the growing prices. In early 2026, BTC miners are still operating at near peak capacity, despite the distressing market conditions. Even smaller mining companies are viewed as potential bets with high returns. BITF is expected to break out based on its ongoing data center plans. BITF is competing with other recently hot mining companies like Riot and IREN, with stocks rising despite the slower BTC market growth. Get seen where it counts.

The cryptocurrency’s price actions have been choppy and uncertain for several weeks. It dipped to a local low of $84,500 on December 19, shortly after the US CPI numbers for November came out, but quickly tightened its trading range. In the following ten days or so, it stood between $90,500 and $86,500. It tried to take down the upper boundary on at least three occasions since then, but each attempt was met with an immediate rejection and a subsequent retracement to the lower boundary. The current business week began similarly, as BTC spiked to $90,500, where the bears stepped up and pushed it south to under $87,000. The bulls intercepted the move and provided an immediate relief rally to $88,000. Sideways action continued in the following days, but BTC ultimately closed 2025 below $88,000, which was a 6-7% yearly decline. January 1 was expectedly a dull trading day, but bitcoin went on the offensive earlier today. It tapped $90,000 once again, only to be stopped and driven south by a grand and a half. Nevertheless, it has managed to bounce off and now sits above $89,000. This means that it’s over 2% up weekly, but its market cap has declined by 0.6% weekly as most alts have marked bigger gains since last Friday. These include ETH, BNB, SOL, and ADA, all of which are up by 5-6%. DOGE has risen by more than 9%, and so has ZEC. XMR, HYPE, and BCH are among the few alts in the red weekly.

As explained above, BTC finished 2025 in the red. While that’s not a first, it did break history as bitcoin had never ended a post-halving year with a negative performance until now. The $10,000 Trump Trade: What Actually Made Money Since Inauguration Day . Trump re-entered the White House on the white crypto horse due to his multiple promises.

Ethereum Suffered Worst Year Since 2018: 9 Red Months in 2025 . The second-largest cryptocurrency also tapped a new all-time high in 2025, but its overall performance was quite the opposite. It saw nine monthly closures in the red, which made it its worst year since 2018. Tether Confirms $779M Bitcoin Purchase Despite Weak Market Momentum .

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-ignore-xrp-at-your-peril-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Crypto markets often hide the most important moves behind quiet accumulation rather than flashy headlines. While retail chatter and media narratives dominate daily attention, institutional actors frequently position themselves well ahead of obvious catalysts . XRP now sits at one of these critical inflection points, signaling that large-scale players may be preparing for a major market shift. The insight came from X Finance Bull, who shared recent institutional flow data on X, highlighting XRP’s unusual stability compared to other top cryptocurrencies. According to the analysis, while Bitcoin and Ethereum saw billions in outflows over November and December 2025, XRP maintained steady net inflows, signaling deliberate accumulation rather than retail-driven speculation. Institutional Flows Highlight Strategic Positioning X Finance Bull pointed out that Bitcoin experienced $3.48 billion in outflows in November and $1.09 billion in December, while Ethereum lost $1.42 billion and $616 million in the same period. XRP, however, saw only $666 million in November and $499 million in December, all positive net inflows. These numbers suggest that institutions actively moved capital into XRP while other major assets faced liquidity drains. IGNORE $XRP AT YOUR PERIL INSTITUTIONS ARE FRONT-RUNNING THE MARKET If you still think ETFs are only about Bitcoin and Ethereum, you’re missing what’s right in front of you Bitcoin saw outflows of $3.48B in November and $1.09B in December. Ethereum lost $1.42B in… https://t.co/gC79IXRRoW pic.twitter.com/V35OxMkYFM — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 1, 2026 This pattern demonstrates more than casual interest. Institutions anticipate regulatory clarity, infrastructure upgrades, and new liquidity corridors, often positioning themselves before these changes reach the public eye. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that professional investors view it as a strategically vital asset in the emerging digital finance ecosystem. ETFs and XRP’s Overlooked Potential Many investors still associate crypto ETFs primarily with Bitcoin and Ethereum. X Finance Bull emphasizes that this narrative overlooks a critical development: institutional capital increasingly targets XRP as regulatory frameworks and market infrastructure evolve. Unlike retail-driven surges, these flows reflect structured positioning in anticipation of XRP’s adoption as a bridge asset in regulated payments and cross-border settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This approach underlines XRP’s growing independence from short-term market sentiment. Institutions prioritize utility, liquidity, and compliance over hype, and XRP now benefits from these long-term fundamentals. Following Capital Flows Over Headlines The data reinforces a key principle: flows often lead markets. While headlines highlight trending stories, institutional movements reveal where smart money expects value to materialize. XRP’s consistent inflows indicate that investors are betting on its future as an essential infrastructure asset, rather than short-term gains. As financial institutions integrate blockchain solutions and liquidity corridors expand, XRP stands poised for broader adoption. Ignoring these signals risks missing early positioning in what may become one of the most structurally significant crypto assets in the next market cycle. By tracking institutional flows rather than narratives, market participants gain a clearer perspective on XRP’s strategic importance and its potential to outperform other major cryptocurrencies.

BTC could sell off immediately after the January FOMC meeting, or even sooner. By comparing BTC to changes in factors that influence real yield trajectories, I assert that BTC’s latest rally has been running on borrowed time since September. Regulatory optimism and one-off positive events may support BTC in the short run, but they are unlikely to alter the broader trajectory. This article concludes a three-part BTC series examining dominance trends, money supply dynamics, and real yields—all of which collectively, and independently, point towards a BTC bear phase. Recently, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management increased exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which could be seen as an indication that the coin may rally further. While I believe in BTC’s long-term growth prospects, in line with Ms. Wood's target of $650,000 to $1.5M by 2030 , I don’t believe her recent BTC and related portfolio additions were to benefit from a short-term rally because my analysis of dominance numbers and money supply in previous articles indicated otherwise. Below is a summary of those two articles, which you may skip and move to the next section if you’ve been following my work. On December 18, 2025, my article titled “ Exit 200%+ Yield MSTY - And Don't Look Back ” argued that dominance numbers are signaling a crypto risk-off sentiment. Precisely, the dominance of BTC hasn’t changed since early November, whereas the dominance of altcoins has diminished. In that timeframe, though, stablecoin's dominance has shot up, indicating that many investors now prefer holding cash over crypto. Then, my article titled “ IBIT: The Risk Of Bitcoin's Decline To $30K ,” published on December 22, 2025, established that there’s a strong correlation between expected money supply changes and BTC. I advocated that the Fed may not embark on any meaningful quantitative easing in the coming years. In the absence of such M2 tailwinds, investors will likely rotate out of crypto. More Evidence In my view, those two articles should’ve been enough for readers to reconsider their BTC positions, especially if their entry price was more than $30,000—my price target. Even still, I’ll provide further evidence to support my assertion that BTC is headed south. To that end, please consider the chart below, which plots BTC prices against changes in real yields (referred to as RYC going forward). BTC-USD vs. 10-Year TIPS YoY % Change (Weekly, Sep 2014 – Dec 2025) (Author's Work - Data from Yahoo and FRED) From a surface-level view, the inverse relationship between BTC and RYC is quite evident: when RYC falls, BTC rallies, and vice versa. Also, BTC rallies usually lag RYCs. That inverse relationship exists because BTC is a non-yielding asset, and when yields are expected to rise, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets goes up, diminishing their attractiveness. The pertinent question then is: what drives RYC? Below is a quick rundown of every RYC directional pivot since the pandemic: RYC collapsed at the start of the pandemic due to the Fed’s zero rates and QE-until-necessary policies in response to the looming threat of a severe pandemic-induced recession and deflation. RYC started accelerating in early 2021, driven by rate hike expectations, which in turn were driven by inflation and growth expectations that had risen based on the possibility of vaccine rollouts. Inflation peaked in mid-2022, indicating that the Fed was approaching terminal rates. An expectation that gained further credence when the yield curve inverted in October 2022 , raising fears of an imminent recession. Consequently, RYC commenced a downward leg at the end of 2022, even though the Fed continued to hike rates until July 2023, because changes in both inflation and GDP trended downward. Inflation reached a point of stabilization at the start of 2024, when it fell to ~2.6%, quite close to the Fed's target—an event coupled with a flattening of the GDP change curve as well. But GDP had softened more than anticipated, raising fears and expectations of a weak economy, causing RYC to dive deeper. To manage that adverse situation, the Fed cut rates by 50 bps on September 18, 2024, and then delivered two more cuts in the same year. RYC changed direction in October 2024—when the market ascertained that the economy would be stable and GDP growth would normalize after the Fed's actions. Finally, RYC pivoted downward slightly at the end of 2024 when market participants believed the economy had digested the stimulatory effects of rate cuts. With all that information presented in this section, it is safe to assert that changes in expectations of long-term inflation and growth are among the primary drivers of RYC trajectories and thus, BTC cycles. Important Nuance Note that I have used the words “RYC trajectories” and “expectations of long-term inflation and growth” intentionally because trajectories and expectations are what matter, rather than singular events. If this nuance isn’t taken into consideration, investors may enter or exit positions at inopportune times. One such inopportune time was when rates were cut in October 2025, leading to only a slight drop in RYC but a big drawdown in BTC ($110,000 to roughly $85,000), i.e., the inverse relation between the two didn’t hold. That decoupling occurred because there were no changes in expectations of inflation and/or growth. Plus, Powell said that another rate cut in December is not a “foregone conclusion,” indicating a possible end to the rate cut cycle of 2025 and a stable economy going forward. In fact, it can be said that BTC’s long-haul price rally has been living on borrowed time since the September FOMC meeting, when Powell mentioned that cuts going forward would be more of a risk management initiative because the summary of economic projections hasn’t changed much (reference: Quote 1 in the appendix). Fed’s Path Forward Historically, the Fed has implemented insurance cuts multiple times, totaling 75 bps in all cases. (Source for rate cuts history: Federal Funds Rate History 1990 to 2026 ). In 2019, to manage the adverse effects of a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. In 2002, to further stimulate anemic economic recovery following the Dot-Com crisis. In 1998, to manage risks arising from the Asian Currency Crisis and the collapse of LTCM. In 1995, to stimulate a stagnant and weaker-than-expected labor market. Rates have already been cut by 75 bps since September 2025, which is why it's reasonable to assume that the Fed Funds rate won't change for the foreseeable future. An assertion further supported by the Fed’s latest economic projections , indicating a 2.4% PCE inflation, a GDP growth rate of 2.3%, and a Fed Funds rate of 3.4% for 2026. Moreover, Powell's statements from the October and December FOMC press conferences clearly indicate that if it weren’t for tariffs, inflation would be very close to the Fed’s target of 2% (reference: Quotes 2 and 3 in the appendix). Finally, he has said many times, and something I discussed in an article here , that tariff-induced inflation is a one-off event whose detrimental effects diminish over time. In summary, inflation is projected to subside in the coming months, GDP is projected to grow, and the Fed has delivered most of its rate cuts. Thus, RYC won’t experience any dramatic trajectory changes. Conclusion In my article on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) referenced/linked earlier, I stated that BTC will bottom between $30,000 and $20,000. To reach that level, however, it’ll experience multiple dramatic drawdowns. As mentioned before, I believe that BTC’s last strong sell-off, which caused it to drop from around $110,000 to roughly $85,000 within weeks, occurred because of normalization of growth and inflation, even though a rate cut was delivered. Therefore, I expect another drawdown, causing BTC to drop to its next resistance level of around $60,000, to occur after the next Fed meeting when an end to the current rate-cut cycle is officially announced—eliminating any doubts about the economy deteriorating further. Could the drop happen earlier? Yes, it depends on the payroll numbers and is quite tricky to understand. In my opinion, market participants, as of now, are quite convinced that there won't be any further rate cuts. But there's also some lingering doubt left along the lines of “What if things get worse in the labor market?” If, however, payroll numbers for December were to present a positive surprise, those doubts would be decisively eliminated, along with doubts about the end of the rate cuts cycle. In such a scenario, BTC may crash before the next FOMC meeting. The primary risk to my thesis is what I’ve already stated in other articles: singular events, such as regulatory changes and institutional participation, serving as tailwinds for BTC. I’d, however, like to further qualify that assertion by adding that such changes may only lead to ephemeral BTC rallies because its long-haul use as an extreme inflation hedge would be irrelevant in the coming economic environment. Lastly, it goes without saying that this ‘strong sell’ recommendation is not only for BTC but also for ETFs derived from it, such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), or corporations that are directly correlated to BTC prices, such as Strategy ( MSTR ). Appendix: Quotes From FOMC Press Conferences Quote 1: September press conference (pages 6 and 7): Yeah, I think you could think of this, in a way, as a risk-management cut, because if you look at the SEP, actually the projections for growth this year and next actually ticked up just a little bit and inflation and unemployment didn’t really move. So what’s different now? What’s different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market. You’ve seen—you know, we were looking at 150,000 jobs a month at the time of the last meeting, and now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers. And I didn’t—I don’t want to put too much emphasis on payroll job creation, but it’s just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off. And that tells you that it’s time to take that into account in our, you know, in our policy. Quote 2: October press conference (page 11): One is that inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2 percent goal. We estimate—people have different estimates of what that is, but it might be five- or six-tenths, and so if it’s 2.8, then core PCE, not including tariffs, might be 2.3 or 2.4, in that range, something like that. Quote 3: December press conference (page 23): And I think the evidence is kind of growing that what's happening here is services inflation coming down and that's offset by increases in goods, and that goods inflation is entirely in sectors where there are tariffs. So that does build on the story. And, so far, it's only a story that this is -- that the goods inflation, which is really the source of the excess at this point, that that -- almost more than half the source of the excess inflation is goods -- is tariffs.",BTC-USD|IBIT|BITO|FBTC|GBTC|MSTR|IBIT:CA|MSTR:CA|MSTY|MSTY:CA,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

However, despite its poor performance in Q4 last year, a crypto analyst has projected four new upside targets for BTC in 2026. The analyst has highlighted an emerging technical pattern and key resistance levels that traders and investors should closely monitor. Bitcoin Expected To Revisit $90,000 Levels In 2026 Market technician Jonathan Carter has shared four new price targets for Bitcoin this year, taking on a bullish stance despite the broader market downtrend and ongoing volatility. The analyst first highlighted a technical structure on BTC’s 8-hour chart that suggests a major price move is coming. Related Reading: People Are Not Ready For Bitcoin; Analyst Reveals What’s Coming Next According to his chart analysis, Bitcoin has been forming a symmetrical triangle since December last year and is now approaching a critical decision point as the pattern nears its apex. Notably, this triangle structure has often preceded aggressive directional moves, suggesting that the market may be gearing up for bullish turnover . For his first bullish target, the analyst expects Bitcoin to surge to $94,000, viewing this area as an initial reaction level following a complete breakout above the $80,000 region. Notably, the chart shows that the $94,000 target was a previous consolidation and minor rejection point during earlier market phases. A move into this area would signal that buyers are successfully pushing prices beyond short-term resistance. Closely following that level is the $97,500 target. The chart indicates that this region previously acted as a pivot where the price struggled to maintain momentum. If Bitcoin holds above $97,000, it could also indicate strengthening bullish control and increase the probability of continuation. Carter’s chart shows that both buyers and sellers have been active , but neither side has maintained dominance, resulting in narrower price swings. This balance suggests that the market is consolidating and may be waiting for a trigger to resolve the structure. Although BTC continues to trade around $88,000, Carter believes the cryptocurrency’s broader structure favors an upside continuation. However, he notes that a confirmation is required before the market can break out and recover from the downtrend. Analyst Sets BTC’s Next Two Targets Above $100,000 For his final two targets, Carter has forecasted a move above the $100,000 psychological level . If Bitcoin successfully clears the triangle resistance, the next major objective is the $100,500 level. Beyond that, the analyst has forecasted a final upside target of around $106,000, representing a roughly 19% surge from current levels. Carter has also marked $106,000 as a sell zone , suggesting that a move into this region would likely attract profit taking , but reaching it would confirm a strong bullish expansion from the triangle pattern. Notably, a clearly marked support zone sits near the lower boundary of the triangle around the $80,000 range. This area has been tested multiple times and continues to hold, reinforcing the validity of Bitcoin’s structure.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Jonathan Carter|Profit-taking|Symmetrical Triangle Formation,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This surge represents a significant psychological and technical achievement for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, fueling intense discussion among investors and analysts globally. Consequently, this price action prompts a deeper examination of the converging factors behind this rally and its potential implications for the broader financial landscape. Bitcoin Price Achieves a New Zenith The ascent past $90,000 marks Bitcoin’s highest valuation since its last major cycle peak. According to data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the move was characterized by strong buying volume and occurred during Asian and European trading hours. This price level consolidates gains from a multi-week uptrend that began in early 2025. Furthermore, the rally appears broad-based, with increased institutional activity noted across major regulated exchanges. Several immediate catalysts contributed to this bullish momentum. Firstly, recent regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has reduced market uncertainty. Secondly, continued adoption by traditional finance (TradFi) firms for treasury reserves has provided a steady demand baseline. Finally, macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns in several economies, have renewed interest in Bitcoin’s perceived store-of-value properties. Analyzing the Drivers of the Cryptocurrency Rally This rally is not an isolated event but the result of sustained fundamental developments. The network’s underlying health metrics remain robust. For instance, the hash rate—a measure of computational security—continues to set new records, reinforcing network integrity. Simultaneously, development activity on scaling solutions like the Lightning Network has accelerated, improving transaction efficiency and utility. Market structure has also evolved significantly. The table below contrasts key metrics from the previous cycle peak to the current environment: Metric Previous Cycle (~$69k Peak) Current Environment (~$90k) Futures Open Interest Extremely High, Leveraged More Balanced, Less Speculative Spot ETF Flows Not Available Consistent Net Inflows On-Chain Holder Behavior High Exchange Inflows Increased Long-Term Holding (HODLing) Institutional Custody Growing Widespread and Mature This data suggests a more mature and structurally sound market foundation supporting current prices. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the role of macro-economic factors. “The breach of $90,000 is technically significant,” notes a market strategist from a major investment bank, citing on-chain data that shows a large volume of Bitcoin moved into wallets with no history of spending. “We are observing a fundamental shift where Bitcoin is increasingly treated as a strategic asset rather than a purely speculative one.” Meanwhile, blockchain data firms report that the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains near all-time highs. This metric, often called the “HODL wave,” indicates strong conviction among long-term investors. Such behavior typically reduces available sell-side pressure, a crucial factor for sustaining price advances. The Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to this point provides essential context. Each major cycle has been defined by a new wave of adoption and a re-rating of its fundamental value proposition. The 2020-2021 cycle was largely driven by institutional discovery and pandemic-era fiscal policy. The current cycle, however, seems intertwined with global monetary policy normalization and Bitcoin’s integration into legacy financial infrastructure through spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Looking forward, several key levels and factors will be watched closely: Technical Resistance: The $95,000 to $100,000 zone is viewed as the next major psychological hurdle. Macro Sensitivity: How Bitcoin correlates with traditional risk assets like tech stocks in a changing interest rate environment. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing policy frameworks in the EU, UK, and US will impact market access and stability. Network Upgrades: Continued improvements in privacy, scalability, and smart contract functionality via layers like Taproot and sidechains. Ultimately, the market’s ability to hold gains above previous all-time highs will be a critical test of this new valuation paradigm. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $90,000 represents a pivotal chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This milestone reflects a complex interplay of improved market structure, deepening institutional participation, and enduring macroeconomic narratives. While volatility remains an inherent feature, the current price discovery above previous cycle highs suggests a market maturing through successive phases of adoption. The focus for investors and observers now shifts to whether this **Bitcoin price** level can form a durable foundation for the next stage of growth in the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly caused Bitcoin to jump above $90,000? A1: The move resulted from a combination of factors: sustained inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, positive regulatory developments in several countries, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty driving demand for alternative assets. It was not a single event but a convergence of sustained bullish catalysts. Q2: How does the current market differ from when Bitcoin last hit a record high? A2: Key differences include significantly higher institutional custody, the presence of regulated spot ETFs creating constant buy-side pressure, lower leverage in derivatives markets, and a larger proportion of the supply being held long-term, indicating stronger investor conviction. Q3: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this rally? A3: Investment timing depends entirely on individual risk tolerance and goals. Financial advisors universally recommend that cryptocurrency should only constitute a small, allocated portion of a diversified portfolio, never funds needed for essentials. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Q4: What are the main risks to Bitcoin’s price at this level? A4: Primary risks include sudden, restrictive regulatory changes in a major economy, a sharp reversal in global liquidity conditions, a critical security flaw discovered in the protocol, or a prolonged downturn in traditional markets causing a “risk-off” sell-off across all asset classes. Q5: What is the significance of the $90,000 price point? A5: Beyond being a round number, breaking decisively above the previous all-time high (around $69,000) is a major technical and psychological achievement. It confirms a new bullish market cycle and shifts the entire historical price range, potentially attracting a new wave of institutional and retail interest.

Investors have begun aggressively buying the dip to start the new year, shaking off the stagnation that characterised the final weeks of December. Over the past 24 hours, the total crypto market cap regained its footing above the psychological $3 trillion mark, having rallied roughly 2% to $3.12 trillion at press time. Market sentiment showed signs of relief as well, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbing 8 points to 36. While this still sits in “Fear” territory, it marks a significant move out of the Extreme Fear doldrums that persisted throughout the holiday season. Altcoins were the biggest beneficiaries of this liquidity injection, with meme coins stealing the show throughout the day. Led by Pepe Coin (PEPE), which saw double-digit gains, the sector outperformed the broader market. Other major meme assets, including Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), were also trading firmly in the green at the time of publication, fueled by a renewed appetite for high-beta plays. Why is Bitcoin price and crypto market up today? Bitcoin and the overall crypto market’s rally today has been driven by a combination of seasonal trends and a resurgence in global risk appetite. One of the clearest factors at play is the “January Effect,” as investors who closed out loss-heavy positions in December for tax purposes are now redeploying capital into the market. This new-year reset has historically sparked inflows, but it’s been especially pronounced this time given the steep end-of-year selloffs. Bitcoin price, for instance, had pulled back nearly 30% from its October peak of $126,000, and many viewed the $85,000 to $87,000 zone as a compelling long-term support range. Today’s move suggests those dip-buying efforts are now materializing with more conviction, aided by whale activity. On-chain data over the past two days has shown a notable uptick in large-holder accumulation, adding weight behind the bounce. At the same time, open interest in futures has risen more than 2%, topping $130 billion, which is a clear nod that leveraged traders are entering the market with bullish bets. This kind of futures-led growth alongside spot price movement tends to confirm underlying momentum. Beyond the crypto-native catalysts, global risk appetite has also returned. Equity futures for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have pointed to a positive 2026 open, as traders begin to price in the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts by March. The ongoing wave of IPOs and improving macro outlook have pulled traditional investors back into high-growth sectors, and crypto often sits high on that list when risk sentiment turns favorable. There’s also a structural tailwind from regulatory clarity that began to take shape late last year. With the GENIUS Act setting clearer guidelines for digital assets and stablecoin frameworks becoming more predictable, institutional participants have more confidence navigating the space. This is already playing out in spot ETF flows, where selling pressure in both Bitcoin and Ethereum has begun to subside. Even meme coins have helped drive sentiment, as traders rotate into riskier assets in search of higher short-term upside. The rally across tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB has added to the sense that capital is flowing more freely again. What’s next for Bitcoin price? For Bitcoin bulls, reclaiming the psychological support level at $90,000 would be a strong validation point that could open the door to further upside. Since mid-December, this zone has acted as a key ceiling, with each rally attempt falling short of a clean break. A decisive push above it could reset the narrative and give traders confidence to begin positioning for a potential return to six-figure territory in the months ahead. Per the 24-hour liquidation heatmap, Bitcoin’s latest rally has clearly forced a large wave of short liquidations, particularly clustered near the $88,000 to $90,000 range. See below: Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The visual density in these upper bands, coupled with real-time data showing $271.65 million in total liquidations, of which $217.82 million were shorts, points to how this move has caught bearish traders off guard. Ethereum bore the brunt with $29.73 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $23.97 million, highlighting the scale of pain for leveraged shorts across majors. At the same time, the BTC liquidation heatmap suggests that if the price can close and hold above $90,000, there is a thin layer of resistance in the immediate range, with fewer liquidation clusters between $91,000 and $94,000. This opens a clean short-term path for bulls to test higher territory, particularly if spot bids continue to rise and ETF inflows stabilise. On the downside, the chart shows a heavy liquidation build-up just below $88,000, followed by more intense bands near $86,000 and $84,500. This area is also where a new CME futures gap has emerged between roughly $87,800 and $88,000, a zone many traders are now watching closely as a potential downside magnet. CME gaps have a long track record of attracting price action, and with the rally unfolding into the weekend, some expect Bitcoin to drift back toward this region before attempting any sustained move higher next week. Market participants have already flagged this risk, noting that weekend trading conditions often produce choppier price action and additional gaps that can complicate early-week structure. “Good one to keep an eye on in the week ahead,” trading account Daan Crypto Trades wrote on X, adding that with the market heading into the weekend, traders could see a few gaps and a messier chart to start the year. If Bitcoin does revisit the $88,000 area, the dense liquidation clusters below could provide short-term support as shorts are forced to cover and dip buyers step in once again. A deeper pullback toward $86,000 or even $84,500 would likely test broader market conviction, but those zones also align with strong liquidation liquidity that could help cushion downside moves. For now, the near-term outlook hinges on whether bulls can maintain pressure above $90,000. At press time, Bitcoin price was trading at $89,598, holding on to gains of roughly 2% on the day. Top altcoin gainers for the day The altcoin market cap rose 3% to nearly $1.36 trillion earlier in the day before settling at $1.34 trillion at press time. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market cap, rose 3.3% over the day, recovering back above $3,000, and was perched at $3,075 when writing. Other large-cap altcoins such as BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) saw similar gains between 2-3% respectively. Nearly all of the top 100 altcoins in terms of market capitalization were in the green. Sector-wise, the meme coin market saw some of the leading gainers of the day as the total tally of all combined went up 12% over the past 24 hours. Among them were Pepe (PEPE), outpacing the rest with gains of 32%, largely boosted by improved community sentiment after a well-followed trader who previously predicted the memecoin move to billions when it was trading at $600k, made a fresh prediction that it would go up by as much as $69 billion by the end of this year. As Pepe rallied, momentum quickly spilled over into other speculative assets, which are often backed by large cult-like followings that tend to eat into the hype. Floki (FLOKI) and SPX6900 (SPX) caught the slipstream of Pepe’s rally to post gains of over 17%, respectively. Other leading memecoins were also hovering in the green at press time.

The Yearly Dogecoin Chart On the yearly view, Cantonese Cat’s chart frames 2025 as a hold of the 0.786 log Fibonacci support at roughly $0.10879, with the market printing an inside candle into year-end. In that construction, the key takeaway is not momentum but structure: price respected a major retracement line on a log scale and stayed boxed inside the prior year’s range: “DOGE ended 2025 holding 0.786 log fib as support, forming an inside candle, favors bullish continuation,” the analyst writes. The same yearly chart also contextualizes what “continuation” on the yearly view means: the next major reference level is the 1.0 fib line up near $0.73905. That is not being presented as an imminent target, but it does underscore why analysts care about this zone, if the 0.786 level holds on higher timeframes, the chart’s mapped upside is structurally open, even if the path is not linear. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mirrors AMD’s Setup From Last Year, Analyst Claims The Monthly DOGE Chart Matt Hughes aka “The Great Mattsby’s” monthly chart tightens the focus to a single, precise level: the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.11778. Price is shown holding that line while carving out what the chart labels as a higher low, and the analyst is explicit about what that would mean in market-structure terms. “To me, this looks like the higher low needed to start the bottoming process, especially with price holding the 0.382 Fib retracement at 0.11778,” Mattsby wrote, adding that he views the “.11–.12 zone” as compelling on a risk/reward basis. In this framing, the thesis is conditional: the market is not “bullish” because it bounced, it’s constructive because it is attempting to stop making lower lows while defending a defined retracement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Mirrors Silver’s Breakout, Analyst Flags $9+ Scenario If that $0.11778 level gives way on a monthly basis, the same fib ladder shown on the chart highlights lower references beneath it, including the 0.236 retracement around $0.08433. On the upside, the next retracement markers visible are $0.15428 (0.5) and $0.20210 (0.618), which would be the nearby “prove it” areas if this is, in fact, a basing process rather than a dead-cat bounce. The Weekly Dogecoin Chart Kevin (Kev_Capital_TA) shifts the emphasis to the weekly. Via X, he posted: “Still early but Dogecoin is currently printing a really nice weekly reversal demand candle within a major demand zone.” His conditions are tight and time-bound: “If you can confirm that weekly candle by Sunday close, reclaim the 4HR 200 sma/ema on both Doge and BTC then you could see the low put in for this major correctional phase and the counter trend move higher occuring. All eyes on 88K-91K on BTC.” For Dogecoin traders, the immediate calls are straightforward: Dogecoin needs to keep defending the $0.11–$0.12 area, while the weekly close either validates or negates Kevin’s reversal-candle thesis. If price loses the $0.11778 monthly retracement, the “bottoming” narrative weakens quickly; if it holds and begins reclaiming nearby resistance levels, the charts collectively argue the market may be transitioning from correction to base-building, one confirmed close at a time. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13242.

This is the worst performance for ETH since the 2018 bear market. The past year saw ETH close nine months in the red, its worst losing streak since 2018. Despite the overall positive performance of the Ethereum network, the underlying token lagged, only briefly making a new all-time high. In 2025, ETH did not suffer a big crisis, yet its performance was worse in comparison to 2022, when only seven months ended in the red. ETH crashed despite the lack of a major catastrophic event or bankruptcy in the crypto space, and in the midst of record wallet activity. While the Ethereum ecosystem showed signs of health, including address activity, stablecoin inflows , and DeFi expansion, the ETH token failed to fulfill expectations for a higher price range. ETH lagged in dollar terms despite a climb against BTC In 2025, ETH lost the faith of retail investors and instead became a playground for whales and institutions. ETH whales attempted to achieve a more favorable average price by buying the dip, but the token did not have enough momentum to break out. ETH failed to fulfill the prediction of Bitmine’s Tom Lee for a hike to $7,500 or even $10,000 at the end of the year. The token ended the year with 11.9% in market cap dominance. Over the course of 2025, ETH managed to recover from lows of 0.019 BTC to end the year at 0.034 BTC. Despite this, the token did not fulfill the expectations of expanding to $10,000. The weak ETH performance also coincided with the failure to launch a more lasting altcoin season. The weakness of L2 performance also affected Ethereum, as liquidity left even top networks like Arbitrum. Treasury companies only had a brief effect on the price of ETH. Unlike BTC treasuries, building up ETH reserves was viewed as a means to earn passive income through staking. Even DAT companies did not show conviction in the climb of ETH, but instead on the token’s DeFi and staking ecosystem. ETH recovered the $3,000 range Despite the downturn, ETH managed to recover the $3,000 range. The token mostly traded above the acquisition price of whales at $2,800, bouncing from this support level. The asset ended 2025 with a net loss of 11% after turbulent shifts each quarter. ETH ended 2025 with a net loss of close to 11%, despite the mid-year relief rally. Even with DeFi recovery, ETH had its worst year since 2018. | Source: Coingecko The token had its worst quarterly performance at the start of 2025, losing over 45%. Later, ETH managed to bounce off the mid-year slump and spend several weeks above $4,000. ETH moved to $3,079.92 as of January 2, following a market-wide recovery. The token ended 2025 with a neutral market sentiment, following weeks of relatively subdued derivative trading. Following the October 11 liquidation, ETH open interest declined to a low of $16.2B, recovering to $18B by the end of 2025. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

From Tech Entrepreneur to Federal Criminal Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, were arrested in New York in February 2022 after authorities traced their wealth to the crypto heist. Morgan had cultivated a public persona as a successful tech businesswoman, describing herself in Forbes articles as an “economist, serial entrepreneur, software investor and rapper” while secretly helping her computer programmer husband launder the stolen fortune from Bitfinex. Both pleaded guilty to money laundering, with Morgan facing an additional conspiracy to defraud charge.

In March 2025, Trump pardoned BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed, and employee Greg Dwyer, all of whom pleaded guilty in 2022 to Bank Secrecy Act violations for failing to implement anti-money-laundering controls at their crypto derivatives exchange. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao received a presidential pardon in October after pleading guilty to similar violations for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at his exchange, the world’s biggest crypto platform. Trump has also expressed willingness to consider pardoning Keonne Rodriguez, CEO of privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Samourai, who was sentenced to five years for money laundering in December. During an Oval Office event on December 16, Trump told reporters: “I’ve heard about it, I’ll look at it. It sounds like, based on your question, Rodriguez. We’ll look at that, Pam,” addressing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present during the session. California Governor Gavin Newsom has intensified criticism of Trump’s pardon strategy, launching a state-backed website in December tracking what his office calls Trump’s “top criminal cronies.” California Governor Newsom slams Trump’s crypto pardons, calling @binance 's CZ and Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht “criminal cronies” in a new state tracker highlighting controversial pardons. #GavinNewsom #TrumpPardons https://t.co/j9Sac1g4Th — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 The site references Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road’s founder, sentenced to life for narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy involving over $214 million in illegal Bitcoin-facilitated drug sales, alongside newly released crime data showing continued declines across California’s major cities. This series of pardons and appeals has triggered significant political backlash, framing crypto clemency as part of a wider debate over corruption, public safety, and the expanding role of digital assets in American politics.

56738010,651787,1767375008,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Turns Negative, But History Says This Phase Could Be Significant",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharpe-ratio-turns-negative/,bitcoinist,"With Bitcoin ‘s waning price action extending and its value still below the $90,000 mark, many key metrics and indicators are starting to enter into negative territory in this new year. One of the major metrics that has turned negative as the year begins is the BTC Sharpe Ratio, which measures the risk level of the flagship cryptocurrency asset. A Rare Bitcoin Risk-Low Opportunity Has Emerged Ongoing volatility has hampered Bitcoin’s price action despite several attempts at an upward move, keeping the asset stuck below the $100,000 mark. Although the Bitcoin market appears vulnerable at first glance, a closer examination of risk-adjusted returns reveals a more complex picture. Darkfost, a market expert and author at CryptoQuant, has delved into BTC’s risk performance via the Sharpe Ratio, revealing a major shift in the market. According to Darkfost, it is a tool for evaluating risk based on the volatility and returns of an asset. By comparing these two variables, analysts are able to determine periods when exposure is more or less risky. Following his analysis of the Sharpe Ratio, the expert has disclosed that the metric has flipped into a negative territory after falling to -0.5, a move that typically unfolds during periods of market stress or transition. As seen in the chart shared by Darkfost, the metric is now approaching a historical low-risk zone. Typically, when the Sharpe ratio falls to low levels, it is accompanied by high-risk periods. However, this implies that returns have been low for Bitcoin, which is volatile by nature. In other words, investors have experienced a series of losses while volatility stays elevated. This shift may be a sign of weakness in Bitcoin market dynamics. However, it brings Bitcoin closer to areas that have historically been associated with lower downside risk and longer-term opportunities. Darkfost highlighted that the best opportunities on Bitcoin typically appear after losses have already been realized and the correction has been intensified by volatility. The trend leads to significant drawdowns and negative returns. For this reason, a negative Sharpe ratio, such as the current drop to -0.5, may indicate a favorable Bitcoin opportunity. In the past, the best purchasing opportunities have appeared whenever this ratio has reached the extremely low-risk zone indicated on the chart. Are Long-Term Holders Now Buying More BTC? A report from Axel Adler Jr., a researcher and author, shows that Bitcoin long-term holders are demonstrating resilience despite current price fluctuations. Adler’s analysis focuses on the BTC LTH Distribution Pressure metric, which has undergone a key shift that could shape the market’s trajectory. Data tells that the LTH Distribution Pressure Index has fallen to -1.628, which implies that the metric has transitioned into the Accumulation zone. The shift points to minimal selling pressure from BTC’s long-term holders, indicating renewed confidence among the cohort in the asset’s prospects. Currently, the average daily LTH spending for Bitcoin is at 221 BTC, marking one of the lowest levels in months. Darkfost also indicated the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is positioned at 1.13, confirming that BTC holders remain in profit levels. With the key metrics positioned at these critical levels, the market structure seems favorable.",Bitcoin News|Axel Adler Jr|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|LTH Distribution Pressure Index|sopr|Spent Output Profit Ratio,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

While both Bitcoin and Dogecoin remain established assets, the attention is largely centered around the accomplishment of a new player called Mutuum Finance . This initiative has recently seen its V1 lending and borrowing protocol thoroughly examined by Halborn Security. The feedback from the examination has also been incorporated, and the smart contracts have been perfected. As investors take a look at the cryptocurrencies to purchase now in light of genuine readiness and not hype, Mutuum Finance, at the current presale stage of 7, seems to slowly emerge as the best crypto. Bitcoin Remains Stable But Has Limited Potential Bitcoin is currently priced around $88,410 as it ends the year 2025 down 5% and has seen limited price action as trading volume has reduced and sellers continue to unload the asset even at a loss. The realized loss for Bitcoin currently stands at $300 million per day. Though it retains the dominant market, the immediate profit potential for Bitcoin appears to be limited. Thus, for instance, if one chooses to purchase a $5,000 Bitcoin today, it may have to perform a strong breakout to gain only a few hundred dollars. It is for this reason that investors are presently looking to other options when it comes to what to purchase for the next cycle. Dogecoin Remains Pinned By Hype Dogecoin remains very much dependent on market sentiment and trends. Although Dogecoin does make rapid movements during a bullish phase, the cryptocurrency does not have much use value and revenue-generating factors. A Dogecoin investment of $1,500 would require a significant lift in price in order for this cryptocurrency to even double in value, which has traditionally happened when viral hype catches up with a particular cryptocurrency, and not because of its fundamental factors. Mutuum Finance Audit Changes The Narrative The main reason for the rapid popularity of Mutuum Finance lies in the fact that the security review has been completed. Halborn Security has conducted a full audit of the V1 protocol, including the lending and borrowing contracts. The audit has been completed, and the recommendations have been implemented. The team is now working on the timing of the V1 launch, and Mutuum has entered the execution phase. This is an important step for those investors searching for the best cryptocurrency to buy today. Presale Growth And Pricing Mutuum Finance has managed to raise $19,550,000 since the presale began and currently has 18,650 holders. It is currently in Phase 7 at $0.04, which is up 300% from the initial phase price of $0.01. Phase 7 is selling out quickly, and this is the last opportunity to get in at $0.04. An example of the value of getting in early is shown in this scenario. Purchasing $250 worth of tokens at $0.04 will get 6,250 tokens. If demand goes up after the launch, and MUTM hits $0.20, it will be worth $1,250. However, waiting until launch at $0.06 will only buy 4166 tokens and deliver a tiny $583 profit when MUTM touches $0.20 Mutuum Finance is creating a DeFi platform that will allow users to borrow or lend their assets with much ease. The platform will have continuous activity rather than being known for one-time hype. The project has developed a dashboard that displays the top 50 wallets and a 24-hour leaderboard that shows the biggest daily buyers. The top-ranked investor every day will receive a $500 bonus in MUTM every day, as long as there is a transaction before 00:00 UTC, when the cycle resets. As the year 2026 draws near, investors are torn between safety and upside. Bitcoin and Dogecoin provide familiarity but little upside. Mutuum Finance comes with a low barrier to entry, a totally audited V1 protocol, and adequate preparation for the launch. For those individuals wondering which cryptocurrency to invest in before the next rally, Mutuum Finance appears to be a key player among the new players.

(NASDAQ: BMNR) today announced the release of a new Chairman’s message ( link ) outlining why shareholders are being asked to vote YES on a proposal to increase the Company’s authorized shares. The message is now available on the Bitmine website and is intended to provide additional context ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. The voting deadline is January 14, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET. In the video, Chairman Tom Lee explains the rationale behind Proposal 2, which seeks shareholder approval to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. There are three reasons the Company needs to increase authorized shares: It would allow Bitmine to conduct capital markets activities, including at-the-market offerings, convertibles, and warrants. It would provide flexibility to pursue opportunistic deals, including potential mergers or acquisitions. Most importantly, it would enable the Company to implement future stock splits as needed. Since pivoting in July to make Ethereum (ETH) its primary treasury asset, Bitmine has observed that its share price has closely tracked movements in ETH. *Coefficient (per Bloomberg) is 0.015 ETH price plus accretion of ETH/share The scatter chart in the gallery above shows the clear linkage (x-axis is ETH, y-axis is BMNR). The Company believes Ethereum represents the future of finance, a supercycle driven by Wall Street reengineering on the blockchain. Major industry leaders agree, including Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who said that tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum. Previously, Bitmine noted its view that tokenization will drive ETH/BTC to reach all-time highs (0.0873). Targeting 0.25 as Ethereum proves to be the future of finance This implies future ETH prices of: $12k $22k (prior high) $62k (0.25, “payment rails”) $250k (if BTC reaches $1mm) These potential future ETH prices can be used to calculate “implied” future BMNR prices** $22k ETH → $500 BMNR $62.5k ETH → $1,500 BMNR $250k ETH → $5,000 BMNR **These are using the coefficient 0.15* ETH plus assumed accretion ETH/share of 33%. These are for illustrative purposes only. Not a forecast. To keep shares “accessible” to the public, the Company would want to split the shares, to reset the share price back towards $25. If BMNR shares are: $500, needs 20:1 split $1,500, needs 60:1 $5,000 needs 100:1 These splits will increase total shares outstanding. Thus, Bitmine can only split shares in the future if the total authorized shares is increased.

The reversal reflects the end of end-of-year tax-loss harvesting that drove Bitcoin down 23% in Q4. Buying volume accelerated at 09:30 ET, contrasting sharply with the “4 p.m. sell-off” pattern observed throughout December. CoinGlass data show futures open interest jumped 2.16% to $130 billion in the last 24 hours, indicating renewed leverage appetite. The Floor & The Flows MicroStrategy (MSTR) likely established the local floor. The firm disclosed on Dec. 29 that it had purchased 1,229 BTC at an average price of $88,568 , defending the range ahead of the New Year.

Hut 8 outperformed the spot market, rallying nearly 15% to $50.73. “The crypto market opens 2026 on a balanced note, driven by renewed institutional interest, clearer regulations, faster ETF approvals by the SEC, and the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin framework, which have boosted confidence, even as most inflows remain concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, noted in an article from The Economic Times . That dynamic flipped on Friday as U.S. spot ETFs and proxies, such as Coinbase (+3%), caught a bid. Market Outlook Despite the rally, prediction markets remain cautious. Polymarket bettors currently assign only 26% odds to Bitcoin exceeding $150,000 in 2026, favoring a consolidation year. Immediate resistance sits at the Q4 2025 breakdown level of $92,500. The headline isn’t the price; it’s the timing . Throughout Q4 2025, U.S. liquidity was the exit liquidity—consistent selling during NY hours to harvest losses. Friday’s price action confirms that the “tax drag” is gone. Desks should monitor the ETH/BTC ratio ($0.034); if U.S. institutions are truly risk-on, expect rotation into high-beta alts and miner equity to outpace spot BTC in the short term.

According to market data that tracks the TOTAL3/BTC ratio — which measures all altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum against Bitcoin — the ratio finished lower for calendar years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. That streak has left traders and fund managers rethinking the old pattern where smaller tokens would often surge after Bitcoin rallies.

Bitcoin dominance was reported at roughly 59–60% during the late 2025 selloff, a level that squeezed room for other tokens. Based on reports, small-cap tokens hit their lowest point in four years as money flowed into larger, more liquid assets. Bitcoin itself slipped from an October peak and ended the year in negative territory, a development covered by major outlets that noted it was the first yearly loss for Bitcoin since 2022. Altcoins have now dropped against Bitcoin for 4 years in a row pic.twitter.com/K3rJhSh1tM — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) January 1, 2026 Widespread Losses And Heavy Market Moves Several data providers found the median performance among the top 30 altcoins was negative for the year. Market value across the crypto sector fell sharply in late 2025, with some estimates saying more than $1 trillion was erased from total market capitalization during the downturn. Traders described 2025 as a year that began with optimism but closed with broad losses, and many small tokens that rose earlier in the year gave those gains back when risk appetite faded. What Analysts Are Saying Some analysts argue that institutional flows and investor preference for liquidity were important drivers of this trend. Others point to macro pressures in the US and global markets that reduced appetite for speculative positions. Reports note that for an altcoin rebound to beat Bitcoin again, fresh capital would need to rotate specifically into smaller tokens, rather than simply following Bitcoin’s moves. That shift has not been evident so far as 2026 unfurls. The TOTAL3/BTC measure is being used by many traders to gauge altcoin strength versus Bitcoin. When that ratio falls year after year, it means a unit of Bitcoin buys more altcoin market cap than before. Market trackers used by exchanges and analytics firms flagged the persistent downward trend across the last four calendar years, which is an unusual run relative to prior cycles when altcoins sometimes outpaced Bitcoin for parts of a market cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Cautious Stance Investors are staying cautious. Volatility remains high and liquidity can dry up fast in smaller tokens, which makes large moves possible both ways. Based on reports, any meaningful restoration of altcoin gains will likely require clear, sustained capital flows and improved market sentiment. Until that happens, Bitcoin’s share of market capital will probably remain elevated, keeping pressure on smaller tokens.

The directive, delivered on Friday, gives the social media giant just 72 hours to submit an action-taken report and implement safeguards, directly threatening X’s legal immunity under Indian law and setting a precedent for AI regulation in one of the world’s largest digital markets. India’s Grok AI Order: The Compliance Ultimatum The Indian government’s order specifically targets Grok’s ability to generate content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. According to documents reviewed by Bitcoin World, the ministry has mandated that X restrict such content generation capabilities immediately. Furthermore, the platform must detail steps taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” This directive follows a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi, who highlighted instances where users prompted Grok to alter images of women to make them appear to be wearing bikinis. Concurrently, separate reports have flagged more disturbing instances where the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors. X acknowledged these lapses in safeguards earlier on Friday, stating that the problematic images had been taken down. However, investigations by Bitcoin World revealed that AI-altered images of women in bikinis remained accessible on the platform at the time of publication. The ministry’s warning carries significant weight: failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections under Section 79 of India’s Information Technology Act, which provides legal immunity from liability for user-generated content. Broader Regulatory Context and Legal Implications This specific order against X and Grok arrives just days after India’s IT ministry issued a broader advisory to all social media platforms on Monday. That advisory reminded companies that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content remains a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity. The government explicitly warned that “non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice.” Expert Analysis: The Safe Harbor Precedent Legal experts specializing in technology law note that India’s action represents a critical test case for global AI governance. “The conditional nature of safe harbor protections is being tested here,” explains Dr. Ananya Sharma, a professor of cyber law at the National Law University. “Platforms traditionally received immunity because they were intermediaries, not publishers. However, when a platform provides a tool like Grok that actively generates content, the lines blur significantly. Governments worldwide are watching how India navigates this new terrain.” Sharma further notes that any tightening of enforcement in India could create ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions, potentially forcing them to adopt the strictest regulatory standards globally. The table below outlines the key components of India’s compliance order to X: Requirement Deadline Potential Consequence Implement technical changes to restrict obscene content generation Immediate Loss of safe harbor protection Submit detailed action-taken report 72 hours from order Legal action under IT Act and criminal statutes Strengthen internal safeguards and moderation Ongoing compliance Fines and potential platform blocking The Political and Market Dynamics at Play India, with its nearly 900 million internet users, has emerged as a crucial battleground for technology regulation. The government’s assertive stance comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court. The platform argues that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even while complying with a majority of blocking directives. This creates a complex backdrop where X simultaneously contests broader regulations while facing specific, urgent demands regarding its AI product. Simultaneously, Grok’s integration into X has increased its visibility and political sensitivity. Unlike standalone AI tools, Grok is increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs part of the platform’s public discourse. This integration means that any flaws in Grok’s content filters have immediate and widespread public impact. The platform’s response to this order will be closely monitored, not just by Indian regulators, but by governments worldwide grappling with similar AI content challenges. Global Implications for AI Governance India’s action represents a significant development in the global struggle to regulate generative AI. Several key factors make this case particularly noteworthy: Market Scale: As one of the world’s largest digital markets, India’s regulatory decisions influence global corporate policies. Legal Framework Test: This case tests the applicability of existing intermediary liability laws to AI-generated content. Technical Enforcement: The order demands “technical changes,” pushing platforms toward proactive content filtering at the generation stage. Cross-Jurisdictional Impact: Compliance measures implemented for India may become de facto global standards for companies. Conclusion India’s critical Grok AI order to Elon Musk’s X platform represents a watershed moment in the regulation of generative artificial intelligence. By directly linking AI content generation to safe harbor protections, the Indian government has established a clear precedent: platforms that provide content-creation tools bear responsibility for their outputs. The 72-hour compliance deadline underscores the urgency with which regulators view these issues, particularly concerning sexually explicit and potentially unlawful material. As X navigates this compliance challenge while simultaneously contesting broader regulations in court, the outcome will undoubtedly shape not only the future of Grok in India but also the global conversation about platform liability, AI governance, and the boundaries of digital free expression in the age of generative artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What exactly did India order X to do regarding Grok? The Indian IT Ministry ordered X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to restrict Grok’s ability to generate obscene, sexually explicit, or unlawful content. The platform has 72 hours to submit a report detailing the steps taken. Q2: What are the “safe harbor” protections mentioned in the order? Under Section 79 of India’s IT Act, intermediaries (like social media platforms) enjoy legal immunity from liability for user-generated content, provided they comply with certain due diligence requirements. The order warns that non-compliance could cause X to lose this protection. Q3: What specific content triggered this government action? The action was prompted by user reports and a formal complaint from an MP regarding Grok generating AI-altered images of women in bikinis and, separately, instances of the chatbot creating sexualized images involving minors. Q4: How does this order fit into India’s broader tech regulation strategy? This is part of a consistent push by Indian regulators to ensure global tech platforms comply with local laws. It follows a broader advisory sent days earlier to all social media companies reminding them of their obligations regarding prohibited content. Q5: What happens if X does not comply within the 72-hour deadline? The government has warned of “strict legal consequences,” which could include action under India’s IT law and criminal statutes against the platform, its officers, and offending users. This could mean fines, prosecution, or even the potential loss of legal immunity for user content.

Together, the claims and charts framed a split market view, with supporters pointing to balance sheet backing while traders priced heavier risk around MSTR’s index status and recent drawdown. Saylor Linked STRC Dividend Pitch Draws Skepticism Adam Livingston said Strategy founder Michael Saylor now offers an “income vehicle” called STRC that pays an 11% cash dividend each month, and he framed the yield as a test of whether traditional finance is misreading the product’s risk. In a post on X, Livingston said critics have questioned whether an 11% monthly paid cash dividend can be legitimate. He also said skeptics have asked where the cash flow comes from, while, in his view, they still accept lower yields from government bonds despite persistent deficit spending. Livingston argued STRC differs from typical high yield products because, he said, it has balance sheet coverage that can support dividends for years, does not rely on refinancing windows to survive, and does not depend on consumer demand or economic growth to keep paying. He added that STRC is being valued like junk credit even though he claims its structure and backing do not match that profile. He also said the debate reflects a larger mismatch in how markets define safety, contrasting STRC with governments running structural deficits, companies that repeatedly roll debt, and pensions dependent on optimistic return assumptions. Saylor Links Bitcoin to MSTR’s Outsize Derivatives Bet Meanwhile, Michael Saylor said “Bitcoin makes $MSTR interesting” in a short post on X, tying Strategy’s stock story to its Bitcoin exposure rather than its legacy software business. MSTR Open Interest vs Market Cap. Source: Strategy / X A graphic shared alongside the message compared “Open Interest / Mkt Cap” across large U.S. stocks and showed MSTR far ahead of peers. The chart put MSTR at 86.2%, while Tesla followed at 22% and Meta at 10.4%. Nvidia registered 7.2% on the same measure, while Alphabet stood at 4.1% and Amazon at 4%. Apple and Microsoft appeared lowest in the group, at 3.4% and 3%, respectively. Polymarket Prices Higher Odds of MSTR MSCI Removal A market tracked by Polymarket showed a sharp rise in the perceived risk that Strategy’s stock, MSTR, could be removed from the MSCI index by March 31. As of the latest reading, the contract implied a 76% probability, up about 40 percentage points from earlier levels. The probability line climbed quickly in early December and then fluctuated between the mid-60% and mid-70% range before settling near 76% late in the month. The chart reflects shifting expectations among traders rather than an official decision by MSCI. The surge in delisting odds has coincided with a steep decline in MSTR’s share price. According to data cited alongside the chart, the stock has fallen about 66% over the past six months, dropping from roughly $457 to around $152.",News|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Price action remains choppy, reflecting a market that has yet to commit to a clear trend. After sharp swings earlier in the quarter, Bitcoin now sits in a compressed range, drawing attention to on-chain data for clues. Traders appear cautious as 2026 begins. Source: CoinCodex Is the market preparing for resolution, or is patience still required? Exchange Netflows Signal Measured Risk Bitcoin’s exchange netflow data shows persistent outflows across most sessions, indicating that more BTC continues to leave exchanges than enter them. This pattern often reflects reduced immediate selling pressure. However, the magnitude of outflows has moderated compared with earlier rally phases. Source: Cryptoquant Large spikes remain sporadic, suggesting selective positioning rather than broad accumulation. Price has responded with sideways movement rather than expansion and the signal aligns with a high-volatility range environment instead of a breakout phase. Coinbase Premium Shows Cooling U.S. Demand The Coinbase Premium Index has remained mostly negative in recent weeks, highlighting softer spot demand from U.S based investors. Periods of positive premium earlier in the year coincided with stronger price advances, yet that momentum has faded. Source: Cryptoquant The sustained discount suggests buyers hesitate to chase higher prices. While not signaling panic, the data points to restrained conviction. Without consistent premium support, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim higher resistance levels. SOPR Reflects Fragile Profit-Taking The Spent Output Profit Ratio currently hovers slightly below 1.0, indicating that coins move on-chain at breakeven levels. This reading suggests holders neither rush to realize large profits nor capitulate at losses. During strong bull phases, SOPR often sustains levels well above 1.0. That condition has not emerged. Instead, price reactions remain sensitive to small shifts in sentiment. On the side note, this behavior supports the view of a market waiting for confirmation. Scenarios Shape the 2026 Outlook Analysts outline three scenarios for Bitcoin in 2026. The highest-probability path remains a twisted range . Rate-cut expectations persist, yet economic recovery lacks strength. ETF flows appear intermittent and short-term in nature. Under this setup, Bitcoin could oscillate between $80K and $140K, with $90K to $120K forming the core zone. Concerns around Federal Reserve independence under President Donald Trump have added uncertainty to the dollar outlook. Goldman Sachs strategists have noted a dovish skew to rate forecasts as leadership changes approach at the Fed. A medium-probability scenario involves a macro shock. If recession risks intensify, deleveraging and ETF outflows could push Bitcoin below $80,000, with downside extending toward $50,000 . The lowest-probability scenario reflects a risk-on revival. Early easing, stabilized ETF inflows, and supportive liquidity could open a path toward $120,000 to $170,000. Such an outcome would require multiple favorable conditions aligning. Eyes Turn to Next Week’s Data Attention now shifts to upcoming U.S. economic data, including Nonfarm Payrolls and the unemployment rate. These releases may influence near-term dollar direction and rate expectations . Strong labor data could limit dollar weakness and cap Bitcoin’s upside. Weaker figures could reignite easing bets and volatility.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56741165,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258055,1767381911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: The Block Research Reveals Stunning Predictions for Bullish BTC, $500B Stablecoin Boom, and Prediction Market Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-2025-outlook-stablecoin-prediction-markets/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: The Block Research Reveals Stunning Predictions for Bullish BTC, $500B Stablecoin Boom, and Prediction Market Dominance NEW YORK, January 2025 – The Block Research has released its comprehensive 2025 cryptocurrency market outlook, revealing significant predictions about Bitcoin’s trajectory, stablecoin expansion, and emerging sector dominance. Analysts present a detailed examination of market forces that could shape digital asset performance throughout the coming year, combining institutional data with macroeconomic analysis. Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: ETF Inflows and Dominance Projections The Block Research analysts project Bitcoin will maintain market dominance exceeding 50% throughout 2025. This forecast relies heavily on continued net inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have fundamentally altered institutional participation since their 2024 approval. According to historical data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated approximately $50 billion in assets under management during their first year of operation. Market timing remains a crucial consideration for investors. Some analysts anticipate sideways price movement during the first half of 2025, followed by a bullish reversal in the second half. This pattern mirrors historical Bitcoin cycles where consolidation periods precede significant upward movements. However, geopolitical tensions and regulatory developments could potentially limit new all-time highs despite favorable structural conditions. Institutional Perspectives on Bitcoin Performance Financial institutions have developed increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin valuation models. The stock-to-flow model, while controversial, continues to influence market expectations. More traditional analysts examine Bitcoin through multiple lenses including: Macroeconomic correlations with inflation data and currency devaluation Network fundamentals including hash rate and active address metrics Regulatory developments across major economies and trading jurisdictions Technological advancements in layer-2 solutions and smart contract capabilities Historical data from CoinMetrics indicates Bitcoin’s 60-day correlation with traditional risk assets has decreased from 0.7 in 2022 to approximately 0.3 in late 2024. This decoupling suggests Bitcoin may be developing more independent price discovery mechanisms as institutional adoption matures. Stablecoin Sector Expansion Toward $500 Billion Threshold The stablecoin market demonstrates remarkable growth potential according to The Block Research analysis. Total stablecoin supply could surpass $500 billion during 2025, representing a substantial increase from the approximately $160 billion circulating at the end of 2024. This expansion correlates directly with several key adoption drivers. Corporate payment integration represents the most significant growth vector. Major payment processors including PayPal and Stripe have expanded stablecoin support throughout 2024. Cross-border settlement efficiency provides compelling cost savings compared to traditional correspondent banking networks. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) reported in late 2024 that blockchain-based settlements reduced average transaction times from 3-5 days to under 24 hours. Stablecoin Market Share Projections 2025 Stablecoin 2024 Market Share 2025 Projected Share Primary Use Case USDT (Tether) 68% 55-60% Exchange trading pairs USDC (Circle) 22% 30-35% Corporate payments & bridging DAI (MakerDAO) 5% 7-9% DeFi collateral Other Stablecoins 5% 4-6% Niche applications Market share redistribution represents another critical trend. USDT’s dominance may decline as USDC emerges as a preferred neutral bridging asset. Regulatory clarity from the United States Treasury Department regarding stablecoin issuance has accelerated institutional adoption of compliant alternatives. European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, fully implemented in December 2024, establish additional compliance requirements favoring transparent stablecoin operators. Prediction Markets Emerge as Dominant Narrative Prediction markets represent one of 2025’s strongest cryptocurrency narratives according to The Block Research. These decentralized platforms enable users to speculate on real-world events using blockchain-based contracts. Growth drivers include increasing geopolitical uncertainty, election cycles in major economies, and technological maturation of oracle networks. Platforms like Polymarket and Augur have demonstrated substantial volume growth throughout 2024. The U.S. presidential election generated over $200 million in prediction market volume across decentralized platforms. This represents a 400% increase compared to the 2020 election cycle according to Dune Analytics data. Market structure improvements including lower fees and enhanced liquidity mechanisms should accelerate adoption throughout 2025. Complementary Sector Growth: Perp DEXs and RWAs Perpetual decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) continue gaining market share against centralized counterparts. dYdX, GMX, and Gains Network collectively processed over $500 billion in volume during 2024. These platforms offer non-custodial trading with leverage up to 100x in some cases. Regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges throughout 2024 has accelerated migration toward decentralized alternatives. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization represents another growth sector. Financial institutions including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have launched blockchain-based tokenization platforms. These enable fractional ownership of traditionally illiquid assets including real estate, private equity, and fine art. The total value of tokenized RWAs exceeded $15 billion by December 2024 according to RWA.xyz data. Market Risks and Potential Headwinds The Block Research identifies several potential headwinds that could impact 2025 cryptocurrency performance. Corporate treasury selling represents a significant concern. Companies holding substantial digital asset reserves may implement profit-taking strategies. Bitmain, the cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturer, reportedly holds approximately 50,000 ETH worth roughly $200 million at current prices. Analysts suggest the company may begin selling these holdings during the first quarter of 2025. Venture capital valuations present additional concerns. Private market cryptocurrency company valuations reached unprecedented levels during the 2021-2022 bull market. Many of these investments face dilution or down rounds as companies require additional funding. Token unlock schedules exacerbate selling pressure. Approximately $50 billion worth of previously locked tokens will become liquid throughout 2025 according to TokenUnlocks.app data. Altcoin performance may demonstrate sustained weakness according to analyst consensus. Only projects with verifiable real-world use cases and sustainable tokenomics will likely maintain valuation. The altcoin market capitalization relative to Bitcoin has declined throughout 2024, continuing a trend that began in early 2022. This suggests capital rotation toward established assets with clearer regulatory pathways. Conclusion The Block Research 2025 cryptocurrency outlook presents a nuanced perspective on market development. Bitcoin dominance appears sustainable given institutional adoption through ETF vehicles. Stablecoin expansion toward $500 billion reflects broader financial system integration. Prediction markets emerge as a dominant narrative alongside complementary sectors including perp DEXs and RWA tokenization. However, investors must remain cognizant of potential headwinds including corporate selling and token unlock schedules. The Bitcoin 2025 outlook ultimately depends on macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and technological innovation across the digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason The Block Research expects Bitcoin to maintain over 50% market dominance? A1: Analysts cite continued net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as the primary driver. Institutional adoption through these regulated vehicles provides sustained buying pressure that supports Bitcoin’s market position relative to altcoins. Q2: How could stablecoin supply realistically reach $500 billion in 2025? A2: Corporate payment integration represents the largest growth vector. As more businesses adopt stablecoins for cross-border settlements and supply chain payments, demand for dollar-pegged digital assets increases substantially beyond current trading-focused usage. Q3: Why are prediction markets considered a strong narrative for 2025? A3: Prediction markets benefit from multiple catalysts including global election cycles, geopolitical uncertainty, and technological maturation. These platforms offer transparent event resolution that traditional betting markets cannot match, creating unique utility. Q4: What risks could limit Bitcoin’s potential for new all-time highs? A4: Geopolitical tensions, regulatory crackdowns in major economies, and macroeconomic factors like sustained high interest rates could suppress price appreciation. Additionally, large-scale token unlocks and corporate treasury selling create technical selling pressure. Q5: Why might USDC gain market share against USDT in 2025? A5: USDC benefits from regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions and its perception as a more compliant, transparent stablecoin. As institutional adoption increases, particularly for corporate payments, entities prefer assets with clearer regulatory standing and auditing practices.

He once called it “a feature, not a bug” while pitching Strategy as the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin holder in the public market. That pitch is about to meet its biggest test yet, as the company prepares to report a multibillion‑dollar loss for Q4 after Bitcoin saw a 24% crash. The expected hit marks a sharp reversal from the prior quarter, when Strategy booked a $2.8 billion profit. This time, the numbers move the other way. The loss is tied to an unrealized markdown on the company’s roughly $60 billion Bitcoin stash, whose value dropped fast as crypto prices fell late in the year. The swing is large, and investors are already bracing for it. Strategy’s accounting change exposes the full effect of Bitcoin’s drop Cryptopolitan previously reported that Strategy changed how it logged its crypto holdings in Q1 2024 when the company began valuing its Bitcoin at current market prices, rather than keeping it at cost. That naturally makes earnings far more sensitive to price moves, especially during sharp selloffs like the one seen in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin fell 24% over that period. That single move explains why the coming loss looks so heavy. Aaron Jacob, an associate professor at Brigham Young University and a senior adviser at Taxbit, put it plainly. “There was this one-time pop, but that is a different story in this quarter,” Jacob said. “It is going to be a sizable loss.” The timing matters. Strategy, once known as MicroStrategy, reinvented itself years ago as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy. That approach paid off for a while. The stock beat major indexes after the shift. But sentiment turned in 2025. The shares fell 48% during the year, signaling growing doubts about the treasury‑heavy model Saylor built more than five years ago. Falling equity prices also raised practical concerns. Bitcoin produces no income. The company’s software unit brings in limited positive cash flow. Investors began to question how Strategy would cover future costs like dividends and interest payments without selling Bitcoin. To ease that pressure, the company raised cash on Dec. 1 by selling common shares and building a reserve. Strategy juggles guidance, balance sheet pressure, and fading premium At the start of last month, Strategy updated its full‑year outlook using a Bitcoin price range of $85,000 to $110,000 by year‑end. Based on that range, the company projected operating income anywhere from a $7 billion loss to a $9.5 billion profit. Bitcoin finished the year down 6.5%, closing at $87,648, pushing expectations closer to the lower end of that range. Saylor’s crypto movement is no longer unique, as you should know, because in 2024, many public companies copied the Strategy playbook to attract investors seeking stock‑based crypto exposure. Some surged early, then sank as prices rolled over. Tommy Lee‑backed BitMine Immersion Technologies followed that path and now faces the same fair‑value accounting rules. Bitcoin’s crash also hit Saylor personally, as his net worth fell about 40% in 2025 to roughly $3.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Another pressure point is Strategy’s enterprise value, which includes debt and perpetual preferred stock, stood at $61 billion, which is close to the value of its Bitcoin holdings and risks slipping below it for the first time in more than two years. The stock has dropped by nearly 70% from its November 2024 peak, dragging the company’s mNAV to just above 1 and wiping out most of the premium investors once paid for Strategy exposure. But on the first trading day of 2026, Strategy stock has surged by 5.2% as of press time to around $160, while Bitcoin has rallied 2.6% to $90,549.

With market cap holding around 1.79 tn and 24-hour trading volume jumping above 44 bn, momentum is quietly rebuilding even as broader sentiment remains cautious. The world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to lead the market, accounting for a large share of the total crypto market cap of roughly 3.06 tn. Circulating supply is now just under 20 mn BTC, leaving limited room before the 21 mn hard cap—an ongoing structural factor supporting long-term valuation. Why Bitcoin Is Rising Today Bitcoin’s latest move higher isn’t driven by hype. Instead, it reflects improving market participation and steady accumulation. Trading volume has surged more than 120% day on day, a sign that buyers are stepping in with conviction rather than chasing short-term moves. At the same time, the Fear and Greed Index remains in “fear” territory near 34, suggesting positioning is still cautious. Historically, that combination—rising price with restrained sentiment—often supports sustained trends rather than blow-off rallies. Altcoin participation remains selective, with the Altcoin Season Index near 24, firmly keeping the market in Bitcoin-led mode. Bitcoin Price Price Prediction: Triangle Breakout to Drive Bullish Price Action Bitcoin price prediction is bullish as BTC is trading near $89,900 on the 2-hour chart, and the structure looks increasingly constructive. Price has been compressing inside a symmetrical triangle, defined by lower highs from the $93,500 area and a rising base formed between $85,800 and $87,000. This pattern reflects balance and declining volatility, not weakness. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The broader trend remains intact. Bitcoin continues to post higher lows, supported by an ascending trendline from mid-December. Price is holding above the 50-EMA and 100-EMA cluster near $88,500–$89,000, where both averages have flattened and started to curl higher. This type of EMA compression often precedes directional expansion when paired with structural support. Candlestick behavior supports that view. Recent pullbacks have produced small-bodied candles with limited lower wicks, showing dips are being absorbed rather than sold. There’s no evidence of distribution patterns or aggressive bearish follow-through. RSI has pushed into the high-60s, breaking above its prior range and signaling building upside pressure without reaching stretched conditions. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Key Levels and Forward View From a projection standpoint, a confirmed close above triangle resistance near $90,500–$90,900 would likely trigger a measured move toward $93,500, followed by the $96,000 region if momentum accelerates. On the downside, the structure weakens only on sustained acceptance below 87,000, which would expose the 85,800 support zone. From a forward-looking lens, this setup resembles consolidation before continuation rather than exhaustion. Acceptance above 90,500 would favor a move toward 95,000 and beyond, reinforcing optimism around the next phase of the crypto cycle as liquidity gradually returns. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Julia Goodwin learned this twice. First, she and her husband Glenn were asleep in their Delray Beach home when tapping at the sliding glass door pulled them into the living room. They thought it was a bird. The light flipped on. The noise stopped. Then the glass exploded. All of a sudden, there were guns pressed into her head and neck while demands came fast for her phone, laptop, and wallet access. Since 2020, more than 215 physical crypto attacks have been recorded worldwide, with 2025 nearly doubling the prior year. Security tracker Jameson Lopp has said the real number is higher because many victims stay silent. According to Bloomberg, the organizer of these crimes is a dude named Jarod Seemungal, better known as Meow, who was a genius at 14, basically living online, coding for games, and getting paid in Bitcoin. But Jarod was robbed himself at gunpoint months later and decided to hire muscle. The Goodwin attack was meant to grab at least $200,000, believed to sit on Gemini. Three days later, the crew abducted a 20-year-old hacker, forced him to open empty Coinbase accounts, beat him, sent ransom videos, and then dumped him near I-95. In Texas, associates burned a man with a hot iron and jammed utensils under his mother’s fingernails. He fled while they searched the yard for a hardware wallet. In another miss, Remy broke into an empty Airbnb wearing a delivery uniform, according to Bloomberg. In July, as the goons staked out a retired New York firefighter believed to hold $200,000 across Coinbase and a Ledger device, the FBI moved. Agents arrested Remy at a turnpike McDonald’s. In his trunk sat zip ties and an AK-style rifle. Sentencing was severe, though. Remy received 47 years for kidnapping conspiracy and wire fraud. Matt, a lookout who earned only $4,000 in seven months, got 12 years. Jarod is due for release in 2040. US largest exchange limits protection as physical crypto attacks rise Meanwhile, Coinbase (the largest crypto exchange in America) says its platform insurance mainly covers server breaches, not coercion. Allegedly , in one instance, machine-learning systems flagged irregular activity and stopped the final $9,145 transfer, not the prior $156,853. Coinbase says it balances stopping bad actors with customer access. Julia still believes in crypto and blockchain, even after two attacks. Travel costs more now. Glenn’s health worsens. She told Jarod in court, “You’ve squandered everything that I worked so hard for.” Meanwhile, Russian hackers are still draining crypto wallets linked to the massive LastPass breach in 2022, according to analysis from TRM Labs. Back then, LastPass had admitted that attackers got into its systems by hacking a developer account. They stole parts of the company’s source code and technical tools. Later, the same hackers hit GoTo, the cloud provider where LastPass had stored encrypted vault backups. Those vaults held not just passwords, but in many cases, crypto wallet seed phrases and private keys. “Depending on the length and complexity of your master password and iteration count setting, you may want to reset your master password,” warned LastPass.

The unlock arrived at a sensitive moment for price action, coming just after XRP closed December 2025 in the red. Large escrow releases often lead to concerns about sell pressure , but early on-chain activity suggests the usual Ripple pattern is already unfolding, with a significant portion of the unlocked supply being prepared for relocking. How The 1 Billion XRP Escrow Release Unfolded Blockchain data shows the release occurred in three major transactions, all settled within a narrow time window on January 1. Immediately the year started, 300 million XRP, valued at about $552 million, was unlocked and sent to the address rMhkqz, identified as the Ripple (28) wallet. Shortly after, another 200 million XRP, worth about $368 million, followed into the same wallet, bringing Ripple (28)’s intake to half a billion XRP within seconds. The final and largest portion arrived into a third wallet during which 500 million XRP, valued at approximately $920 million, was released to the r9NpyV address, designated as the Ripple (9) wallet. Together, these transactions completed the scheduled 1 billion XRP escrow release, immediately increasing the circulating supply on paper. The timing of the escrow release adds complexity to XRP’s near-term outlook. XRP ended December 2025 with a red monthly close of negative 14.8%. Notably, this was the first time XRP closed December in the red since 2022. An influx of unlocked tokens during such a period can increase bearish sentiment, particularly among short-term traders sensitive to supply changes. Relocking Activity As Ripple Repeats Its Playbook History shows Ripple always relocks between 70% and 80% of each monthly escrow release, a practice that has helped soften long-term supply shocks. Interestingly, activity after the unlocks indicates this approach was repeated within 24 hours of the unlocks. Transaction records from XRPScan reveal that funds exiting the Ripple (9) wallet were quickly routed toward new escrow arrangements, and a substantial share of the newly released supply was removed from immediate circulation. Millions of tokens were sent out from both Ripple (9) and Ripple (28) simultaneously. At 17:17 UTC, an escrow creation transaction locked 500 million XRP into the Ripple (15) address, followed by another escrow creation at 17:21 UTC that secured an additional 100 million XRP in the same wallet. Related Reading: Ripple’s XRP Ledger Just Did Something Bitcoin Has Never Done Parallel activity was also observed from Ripple (14), where a separate escrow creation locked 100 million XRP at 17:19 UTC. Combined, these transactions accounted for 700 million XRP already placed back into escrow. The appearance of escrow creation transactions changes the narrative of a supply dump. Instead of a full-scale sell-off, the data points to controlled relocking consistent with Ripple’s strategy of escrow management. XRP’s price response will likely depend less on the headline escrow release itself and more on how much of the remaining unlocked supply reaches crypto exchanges.",Ripple|blockchain|escrow|ripple|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In early trading on January 2, Strategy shares rose modestly, offering brief relief after months of pressure. Even with the bounce, the stock remains down roughly 66% from its July peak. The company’s mNAV, a measure comparing its market valuation to the value of its Bitcoin holdings, stood near 1.02, leaving little margin before slipping below 1.0. A move beneath that level would mean the market is valuing Strategy at less than the Bitcoin it owns. Why Strategy’s Bitcoin Discount Is Raising Red Flags The distinction matters because Strategy’s equity appeal has long rested on trading at a premium to its Bitcoin reserves. When mNAV falls below 1.0, investors can theoretically buy Bitcoin more cheaply by purchasing the asset directly rather than holding a stock that represents it. Historically, such conditions have triggered selling pressure, as the rationale for paying corporate risk, dilution, and management costs weakens. The company’s balance sheet reflects the tension. Strategy holds 672,497 bitcoin, the largest corporate stash in the world, accumulated since August 2020 at an average cost of about $75,000 per coin. With Bitcoin trading around $90,000, those holdings are worth roughly $60.7 billion, leaving the company with an unrealized gain of about 20%. Despite that, Strategy’s basic market capitalization sits closer to $45 billion, and its diluted valuation is around $50 billion, already implying a discount to the underlying assets. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries On an enterprise value basis, which accounts for debt and cash, Strategy’s mNAV is estimated just under 1.0. That proximity has sharpened scrutiny because the company relies on issuing equity at a premium to fund further Bitcoin purchases. If the stock trades persistently below the value of its reserves, raising capital through share sales becomes more difficult and potentially dilutive. Management has taken steps to reduce near-term funding risk. In recent weeks, Strategy raised $747.8 million through stock sales under its ATM program. Billionaire Michael Saylor’s Strategy boosts USD reserves by $748M to $2.19B via its ATM program, while holding 671,268 BTC unchanged. #BTC #Bitcoin https://t.co/gOqBzbzzXy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 The company says the reserve now covers roughly 21 months of dividend and interest obligations, easing pressure to liquidate Bitcoin during periods of market stress. Executives have described selling Bitcoin as a last resort , to be considered only if other financing options close and the firm’s valuation falls below its asset base. Bitcoin Premium Shrinks as Strategy Stock Struggles Still, another threshold looms below the mNAV line. If Bitcoin were to fall under Strategy’s average acquisition price near $74,000, the company’s holdings would drop below cost, potentially testing investor confidence. While some shareholders view such scenarios as long-term buying opportunities, they can also amplify volatility among traders less committed to the strategy. The stock’s recent performance reflects that uncertainty, with Strategy shares having fallen more than 60% over the past six months and ending 2025 down nearly 50%, making it the worst performer in the Nasdaq-100 last year. Source: Google Finance The decline followed a sharp rally earlier in 2025, when the stock surged alongside Bitcoin before reversing as risk sentiment shifted in the second half. Bitcoin itself remains elevated, trading about 28% below its all-time high but up sharply in recent sessions on rising volume. That divergence between Bitcoin’s resilience and Strategy’s equity weakness has fueled debate over whether the company now resembles an investment vehicle rather than an operating business. Critics, including economist Peter Schiff, have pointed to the stock’s drawdown as evidence that aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has weighed on shareholders.

That sharp month-to-month decline was driven by fewer large-scale heists, but the damage that did occur was still significant. Reports have disclosed a mix of scams and technical failures that together made December anything but risk-free. December Losses Fall 60% PeckShield tracked roughly 26 major exploits during the month. The largest single hit was an address poisoning scam that took about $50 million. In that scheme, victims were tricked into sending funds to an address that looked almost identical to a legitimate one. Other large losses included a $27 million drain from a multi-signature wallet tied to a private key leak, about $7 million tied to a Trust Wallet exploit, and roughly $3.9 million linked to issues involving the Flow protocol. These figures were reported across multiple outlets and match the totals PeckShield compiled. #PeckShieldAlert December 2025 witnessed ~26 major crypto exploits, resulting in total losses of ~$76M. This figure represents a decrease of over 60% from November’s total of $194.27M, marking a significant reduction in monthly losses. Notably: Wallet 0xcB80…819 lost $50M… pic.twitter.com/CNW3R6646j — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) January 1, 2026 Major Scams Still Cause Big Damage Address poisoning stood out because it relies on human error rather than a broken protocol. A small mistake — copying the wrong address — could wipe out a large transfer. Trust Wallet’s loss was linked to a browser extension weakness that allowed attackers to move funds. In some cases, reimbursements were being discussed by affected services. Reports have disclosed that private key exposure, even in wallets meant to be secure, continues to be a common root cause of big losses. Some experts say the fall in dollar losses reflects fewer massive breaches, not a vanishing of threats. Security teams have been more active, and some wallets tightened checks. But the methods used by attackers did not disappear. Scams that prey on mistakes, like the address trick, are still in play, and sophisticated intrusions remain possible. It was observed that a handful of incidents accounted for the bulk of December’s total, which helps explain the large swing in monthly totals. Close monitoring into these trends by regulators and other stakeholders like platform operators will continue as well. There have been growing pressures to provide better protections for exchanges and other wallets when there has been a breach; and for more timely actions after the compromise has been identified.

His exit from federal custody was made possible through the First Step Act, a prison reform law signed by Donald Trump during his first term in office. The news broke Thursday night after Ilya posted the announcement himself on X, saying, “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.” Ilya had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years behind bars. That came after he pleaded guilty to helping move billions of dollars in stolen crypto and confessed to the Bitfinex hack, which at current market prices totals more than $4 billion. His prison term factored in time already served after his 2022 arrest, giving him credit that slashed down his time inside. Trump’s First Step Act reduces sentences and puts crypto offenders on home confinement The First Step Act, passed in December 2018, was introduced as a bipartisan attempt to reduce the size of the U.S. federal prison system. It allowed inmates to earn early release or home confinement if they met certain behavior requirements and were deemed low risk under a federal assessment system. Ilya appears to have qualified, and as of Friday morning, a federal inmate search showed him set for official release on February 9. According to CNBC, a Trump administration official confirmed that Ilya “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” Heather Morgan, Ilya’s wife, also confirmed his early return in her own X post, two minutes after his, writing that,“The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart,” and attached a photo of them smiling together. The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart. 💜🙏🪬 https://t.co/toUJ0Bz70h pic.twitter.com/plsnktmJ5l — Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan (@HeatherReyhan) January 2, 2026 Heather had pleaded guilty alongside Ilya in the same case for helping launder the stolen funds and was sentenced to 18 months in February 2025, only to announce her early release in October. In a video posted on October 26, Heather appeared in a bathtub wearing just a towel and addressed her followers: “Why hello Razzlers, I have missed you,” using her rap alias, Razzlekhan. She ended with a nod to Trump: “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter.” The timing of his release lines up with the White House’s expanded use of the law in 2025 under Trump’s second term. On his first day back in office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who had been serving a life sentence. Then, in October, he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, the founder of Binance. CZ had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.

According to the model, all three could see some serious volatility in the weeks ahead, with sharp moves possible in both directions. Below is a breakdown of Qwen3-MAX’s two-sided forecasts, covering both bullish upside targets and bearish downside risks for each asset as 2026 gets underway. Ripple (XRP): Alibaba AI Predicts Rally Toward $5 by Year-End Under its bearish scenario, Alibaba’s AI projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could slide from its current price near $1.90 to roughly $1.50 and stay in that range as a worst-case outcome. You can already hear the loudest “I would take it” from XRP holders if that is truly the worst-case scenario. Source: Ailbaba AI Prediction On the optimistic side, Alibaba’s model envisions a powerful breakout, with XRP potentially jumping 82% to reach $3.50 or even $5 before the end of the year, nearly two times its previous all-time high. The launch of U.S.-listed spot XRP ETFs could act as a catalyst for fresh institutional inflows during the new year, mirroring early demand patterns seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Solana (SOL): Alibaba AI Forecasts a 400% Upside Move Alibaba AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 is to target $300 to $400 price range. That is almost 400% from the current price. Solana still looks like the coin of the cycle. Alibaba’s AI outlook points to Solana’s unmatched speed, booming DeFi activity, and growing institutional interest as the main drivers. With all of that happening while price continues to hold above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for a big move heading into 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. If it fails to rally, Alibaba AI predicts the price could drop below the $100 mark in the bearish scenario. Bitcoin (BTC): Alibaba AI Says Bitcoin Could Surge Past $150K After closing 2025 in the red and breaking the classic four-year cycle, Alibaba’s AI expects Bitcoin to come back swinging and push past $150K by the end of the year. The call is driven by accelerating spot ETF inflows and macro conditions that favor hard assets. In a stronger scenario, the model even sees Bitcoin peaking around $175K. Bitcoin is heading into 2026 at a pretty critical point. Price is getting squeezed, RSI is starting to curl up, and institutions keep stacking, even though prediction markets are not convinced a fast six-figure breakout is coming. On Polymarket, $120,000 is still seen as the most likely outcome, while BTC continues to coil inside a tight range around $89,000. Whatever move comes next is likely going to set the mood for the rest of the year. If Bitcoin can get a clean close above $90,500, that would break the triangle to the upside and likely send the price toward $92,800 first, then $95,000. A break below $87,000 would hurt the setup and open the door to a move down toward $85,800. For now, though, the structure still slightly favors the upside. Maxi Doge Is Built For Moments Like This When the market is having violent swings, uncertainty, and two-sided chaos across majors like XRP and Solana. History shows one thing clearly: memecoins thrive when conviction disappears. This is where Maxi Doge stands out. Maxi Doge is not trying to compete with Layer 1 narratives, ETF headlines, or institutional timelines. It exists for pure momentum, community-driven upside. It also reflexive moves when traders rotate out of crowded trades and into asymmetric bets. Every cycle, when majors stall or chop, capital looks for something louder, faster, and unapologetically speculative. That is exactly where Doge-style assets explode, and Maxi Doge is positioned as a high-beta expression of that rotation. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 71% APY through staking rewards. No promises of revolution. No overengineered roadmap. Just liquidity, attention, and crowd psychology. If 2026 starts with volatility, indecision, and sharp rotations, Maxi Doge is designed for that environment, not despite it.

Right now, XRP, Solana, and PEPE are standing out as some of the more interesting picks to watch as potential best crypto to buy. Even with Bitcoin bouncing back toward $89.5K, most altcoins are still down more than 50% from their all-time highs. Bitcoin has pretty much broken the classic four-year cycle narrative, so nobody can say with confidence what comes next. Still, when you look at fundamentals, SOL, XRP, and PEPE remain some of the most compelling names going into the new year, and here is why. Ripple (XRP) Could Head To $8 In 2026: Bank Analyst Predicts XRP just hit an eight-year low in exchange supply, which usually points to accumulation happening while price sits near lows. A big part of that is coming from ETFs, which have already pulled in over $1.4B since launch. That is close to 0.75% of the total XRP supply in just a couple of months. On top of that, analysts at Standard Chartered think XRP could rip more than 300% and push past $8 in 2026, fueled by spot ETF demand and the regulatory clarity XRP finally has.. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Solana (SOL) is The Top Chain In 2025 And Could Do It Again In 2026 Solana is not an emerging chain anymore. It closed 2025 as the top blockchain by revenue, bringing in over $1.4B and even beating Hyperliquid, which came in second. It also led all chains in DEX volume and ranked second only to Binance Smart Chain in active addresses back in November, and that was during one of the weakest periods for the network. Source: Cryptorank Another big milestone that cannot be overlooked is the approval of Solana ETFs. These are expected to bring fresh demand into the ecosystem, similar to the launch period when SOL logged 21 straight days of inflows. With all of this happening while price is still holding above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for an explosive move in 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. PEPE Could Do It Again And Start Memecoin Season PEPE is already up nearly 50% since the start of 2026. Last bear market, PEPE came out of nowhere and was one of the sparks that helped kick off the bull run. It basically created the memecoin season everyone still remembers. With the way it is moving now, a lot of people are starting to think it could pull that off again and bring memecoins back to life. That candle just smashed through a resistance that held for months around $0.000005, but there is still a long road ahead. After this push, RSI is sitting around 89, which is clearly overbought, not oversold. That means a pullback would be normal here. If PEPE manages to flip that old resistance into support on a dip, it could be setting up for a very strong year. It could end up recreating the same kind of rally it pulled off earlier in 2025. If that happens, the coin below stands out as one of the strongest candidates to follow that move. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Be The Next Coin To Follow This Move While large caps like XRP and Solana grind through key levels, early-stage capital is already rotating into higher-upside plays. One project pulling attention right now is Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2 focused on speed, scalability, and real utility. Something many investors feel Bitcoin itself lacks today. The project has already crossed the $30M raised milestone. This is notable given the current market environment and risk-off sentiment across altcoins. What stands out is timing. Bitcoin Hyper is gaining traction. While most speculative assets are still deeply discounted, the same setup that historically produced outsized returns once momentum returned. If 2026 turns into a broader risk-on year, Bitcoin Hyper sits in a strong position to benefit from that rotation. As always, high-upside plays come with higher risk. But for traders looking beyond large caps, Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up as one of the more watched narratives going into the year.

This surge in accumulation could be a strong signal, raising the odds of a bullish XRP price prediction in the near term. January has often been a favorable month for altcoins. Data from CoinGlass shows that Ethereum (ETH) , the top altcoin, has closed the month with gains in 5 of the past 9 years, hinting at a possible repeat performance across the market. Deep-pocketed participants may be positioning their portfolios to benefit from this trend if history repeats. According to data from Santiment, whales holding over 1 billion tokens added $3.6 billion worth of XRP between December 31 and January, pushing the total of XRP they own to 27.47 billion tokens. Although smaller whales have been progressively dumping the asset, bigger ones are accumulating, signaling a strong shift in sentiment. XRP Price Prediction: Crossing $1.90 Could Set the Stage for an Explosive Move Upwards XRP has increased by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. Trading volumes are still relatively low, accounting for just 1.5% of the token’s circulating market cap. Source: TradingView The $1.90 level is the key resistance to watch as a move above would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure. Such a trend reversal could mark the beginning of a strong move to $3. Since seasonality favors a bullish outlook, this could be a strong month for XRP from a statistical standpoint. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index has just flipped bullish by moving above its 14-day average, a signal that often marks the start of broader altcoin recoveries. If that momentum carries through, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could move first, especially as it brings Solana’s speed and low costs to Bitcoin’s secure network, while the window to get in early is still open. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $30M as Investors Bet on the Future of a Scalable Bitcoin The Bitcoin network has long struggled to grow beyond simple transactions, limited by slow speeds and high costs. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is breaking that barrier, raising over $30 million to build the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, one that can handle thousands of transactions at lightning speed and minimal cost. Powered by Solana’s high-performance tech, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers launch advanced dApps directly connected to Bitcoin, without forcing users to move their assets off the original chain. It’s a massive leap for Bitcoin utility, and investors are rushing in before it goes live. The Hyper Bridge is designed to receive BTC tokens in a designated Bitcoin wallet and mint the corresponding amount in the Hyper L2 almost instantly. Once in there, investors can earn yield, stake, and lend their assets. They will also get access to a growing list of DeFi apps, payment platforms, and even meme coin launchpads. The demand for $HYPER, the protocol’s native asset, should skyrocket as adoption accelerates. To buy $HYPER and seize this opportunity, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL for this token or use a bank card to invest in seconds.

SOL remains capped below stacked EMAs, with the 50-day near $136 as key resistance. Spot flows show early stabilization, but conviction remains limited. By Parshwa Turakhiya Solana (SOL-USD) is starting the new year locked in an uneasy balance, trading near the $127 to $128 area on Friday after months of steady compression. Price is no longer in free fall, but it has not reclaimed trend control either What is driving the tape is hesitation rather than fear. Selling pressure that dominated November and December has largely burned off, yet buyers remain selective, stepping in on dips instead of chasing upside. That dynamic explains why the opening sessions of 2026 have been defined by sideways trade rather than a sharp rebound. The tone feels defensive but calmer. Volatility has compressed, intraday swings have narrowed, and price has gravitated toward equilibrium. This is the market pausing to reassess after a difficult second half of 2025, not one bracing for immediate capitulation. The tension heading into January is clear. Sellers no longer appear urgent, but buyers are not confident enough to force a breakout. Until one side gains conviction, Solana is likely to remain range-bound, with rallies sold and dips bought selectively rather than aggressively. Daily structure remains defensive despite stabilization On the daily chart, the broader structure still leans bearish. Solana remains below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, which are stacked bearishly from roughly $126 through the mid-$160s. The 20-day EMA has flattened near the current price, a sign that downside momentum has slowed. However, the 50-day near $136 and the 100-day around $152 continue to represent heavy overhead supply. Until price can reclaim at least the 50-day on a closing basis, upside attempts are likely to be treated as corrective rather than the start of a new trend. SOL price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum confirms that assessment. The daily RSI is hovering just below 50, reflecting balance rather than strength. Strong reversals typically require RSI to push decisively back above the mid-50s. Solana has not done that yet. The market has neutralized oversold conditions, but it has not flipped into accumulation mode. Short-term structure offers a more constructive, though still cautious, view. On the 30-minute chart, Solana has reclaimed short-term trend support, with Supertrend flipping positive and price holding above SAR dots near $126. This favors dip-buying over selling rallies, but the advances have been choppy and incremental. Each push toward $128-$129 has met supply, suggesting short-term traders are fading range edges rather than positioning for continuation. As long as the price holds above the $125-$126 zone, near-term bias remains mildly constructive. A clean loss of that area would likely invite another sweep toward $122. Flows and positioning hint at stabilization, not conviction On-chain flow data adds important context. Spot netflows have been largely negative for months, reflecting steady distribution during the second half of 2025. That trend has recently eased. The latest readings show modest net inflows of around $3M as price stabilizes near $127. This is not aggressive accumulation, but it does suggest forced selling pressure has cooled. Historically, Solana has required sustained positive inflows to support durable rallies. For now, the data points to stabilization rather than a shift in behavior. Derivatives positioning tells a similar story. Futures open interest has ticked higher even as price moved sideways, sitting near $7.5B. That combination often signals traders rebuilding exposure after a washout, but it also raises the risk of volatility if price breaks out of its range. Long-short ratios show retail accounts leaning modestly long, while top traders remain heavily skewed long by account count. That divergence implies professional traders are positioning for upside, but cautiously, likely hedged and size-managed. Recent liquidation data supports that view, with shorts absorbing most losses during minor rallies while long liquidations remain contained. From a bullish perspective, the roadmap is defined but demanding. Solana needs to hold above $125 and reclaim $130 with authority. A daily close above the $136–$138 zone, aligned with the 50-day EMA, would be the first meaningful signal that trend control is shifting. If that occurs alongside improving spot inflows and expanding volume, a move toward $150 becomes plausible, reframing Solana as a recovery trade rather than a laggard. The bearish scenario remains straightforward. Failure to defend $125 would expose the lower end of the recent range near $122. A breakdown there risks reopening the path toward the psychological $110 level, especially if broader crypto sentiment weakens or Bitcoin rolls over. With the 200-day EMA still far overhead, macro shocks could quickly turn this quiet consolidation into another leg lower. Previously, we noted that Solana’s late-2025 declines were marked by persistent distribution and repeated failures at key moving averages. While selling pressure has eased, that structural backdrop has not yet changed. Confirmation is still missing. For now, Solana is no longer collapsing, but it is not trending either. Until price reclaims higher-time-frame resistance and spot flows turn decisively constructive, this remains a market defined by patience rather than momentum.

SOL is now up by 4% in a week, although it does remain down by 9.5% in a month and by 38% in the past year. These percentages may be disappointing, but there are strong reasons to believe that the Solana price is on the brink of a strong and sustained recovery. Not only do its fundamentals remain as strong as ever, but high-profile investors are also tipping the coin for big things, with Skybridge Capital founder and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci picking Solana as one of his top 3 alts to watch in 2026. Solana Price Prediction: Wall Street Investor Scaramucci Picks SOL as Top Altcoin for 2026 – $1,000 SOL Incoming? Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci picked Solana, Avalanche, and Toncoin as his 3 cryptocurrencies that could outperform the market this year. Explaining why he chose Solana, the entrepreneur and former lawyer said that SOL is “cheap, low cost, very fast, easy to use, easy to develop on.” And while clarifying that he believes in a “multi-coin world,” Scaramucci explained that he’s singling out Solana because it has all the key attributes a layer-one platform would need to succeed. Of course, one investor’s remarks on their own aren’t enough to move a major token such as Solana, yet we can see from its chart today that it may be very close to a breakout. Not only has a bullish pennant been forming over the past few months, but also SOL’s two primary indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are about to turn positive after weeks of negativity. Source: TradingView Indeed, Solana has been in an oversold position for so long now that a major rally is overdue, and it looks like such a rally could be beginning. Solana’s fundamentals also point towards strong growth this year, given that Solana remains the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of total value locked, at $9.3 billion. It’s also worth pointing out that its DEX volume, at $2.97 billion, is higher than Ethereum’s, which stands at a less impressive $1 billion. We’ve also seen the launch of several SOL ETFs in recent weeks , with 2026 likely to bring many more, pushing up the Solana price even higher. Based on this, we could see SOL hit $150 by the end of January, $250 by Q2, and then $1,000 by the end of 2026. Solana-Based Bitcoin Hyper is Ready to Launch Bitcoin’s First Ever Layer-Two Network: Next 100x Alt? As strong as Solana looks right now, traders may want to maintain a diversified portfolio in order to increase their exposure to potential gains. One way of doing this is to allocate some funds to presale coins, which, under the right conditions, can rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is what Solana-based layer-two network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is hoping to do, with its sale now having raised $30 million so far. Ringing in 2026 in style. 30M Raised! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/dZ4WkGMSvv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) January 1, 2026 This makes Bitcoin Hyper’s one of the biggest presales of the last 12 months, and indicates that it could become very popular once it launches. What’s interesting about Bitcoin Hyper is that it’s in the process of launching an L2 network for Bitcoin, one that is aiming to provide investors with a whole DeFi ecosystem in which to put their BTC to work. It harnesses Solana’s Virtual Machine, giving it a level of speed and scalability that will make it one of the fastest L2s around, while also making it compatible with Solana-based dapps. By depositing BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, users will receive a corresponding amount of HYPER, which they can then use with the L2’s growing range of dapps and protocols. In other words, they will be able to lend out the value of their Bitcoin, or they could stake their tokens and earn a yield, which currently stands at 39% APY. This is why Bitcoin Hyper has performed so well during its sale, which investors can join by going to the project’s official website . HYPER currently costs $0.013515, although this price will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts.

Instead of a broad-based rally, most altcoins suffered deep and prolonged drawdowns, erasing years of gains and forcing many investors out of the market. As 2026 approaches, sentiment around altcoins remains fragile. A growing number of analysts now warn that the worst may not be over, arguing that structural weakness, declining liquidity, and fading retail participation could drive another leg lower across the sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Market data reinforces this cautious outlook. The Crypto Total Market Cap, excluding the top 10 assets—commonly referred to as the OTHERS index—has collapsed by more than 50% since December 2024. Market capitalization has fallen from roughly $451 billion to around $182 billion in just twelve months, highlighting the scale of capital destruction across mid- and small-cap tokens. This sharp contraction reflects aggressive de-risking, weak demand, and sustained selling pressure across the altcoin market. However, not all analysts are convinced the altcoin cycle is finished. A smaller group points to historical precedents, arguing that periods of extreme underperformance and investor capitulation have often preceded powerful altcoin recoveries. From this perspective, 2026 could mark the delayed arrival of an altcoin season—if liquidity conditions improve and capital rotation resumes. Altcoin Trading Activity Remains Elevated Despite Price Weakness A recent CryptoQuant report challenges the widely held belief that this cycle has produced “no altcoin season.” According to the data, centralized exchange trading volume for altcoins—excluding the top five assets—has reached levels significantly higher than those seen in previous market cycles. In other words, altcoins are being traded more actively than ever, even as prices remain deeply depressed across much of the market. This divergence between volume and price helps explain the prevailing confusion. While many tokens have lost a substantial portion of their value, on-chain and exchange data show that activity has not disappeared. Instead, the market has undergone a structural shift. Retail participation has largely faded after months of losses, with many smaller investors capitulating and exiting positions. Their absence, however, has not resulted in lower overall trading activity. CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that altcoin dominance has increasingly concentrated among larger players. Whales and professional participants now account for a growing share of altcoin volume, using periods of low liquidity and weak sentiment to accumulate positions or actively rotate capital. From this perspective, the current phase may not signal the absence of an altcoin cycle, but rather its transformation. If whale-driven positioning continues and broader market conditions improve, these participants are likely to push prices higher to maximize returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Distribution Re-Emerges: BTC Enters A Fragile Price Phase OTHERS Market Cap Shows Prolonged Compression The OTHERS chart, which tracks the total crypto market capitalization excluding the top 10 assets, highlights the depth and duration of the ongoing altcoin correction. After peaking near $450 billion in late 2024, the market has lost more than half of its value, stabilizing around the $200–210 billion zone. This sharp contraction confirms that the altcoin market has experienced a full reset rather than a shallow pullback. From a technical perspective, the structure reflects prolonged compression. Price is currently oscillating around the 200-week moving average (red), a level that historically acts as a long-term equilibrium zone during transitions between bearish and recovery phases. The failure to reclaim the 100-week and 50-week moving averages suggests that upside momentum remains weak and that buyers lack conviction at higher levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Volume dynamics reinforce this view. While periodic spikes appear during sell-offs and relief rallies, there is no sustained expansion in volume that would signal broad-based accumulation. This implies selective positioning rather than widespread risk appetite. Importantly, the market is no longer making aggressive lower lows, indicating that forced selling may be largely exhausted. However, the absence of higher highs keeps the structure neutral-to-bearish. For a meaningful altcoin recovery, OTHERS would need to reclaim the $260–280 billion range and hold above key moving averages. Until then, the chart suggests consolidation, dominance by larger players, and a market still searching for a durable bottom rather than the start of a classic altcoin season.

The conversation addressed how investors can structure their portfolios for the future and how assets such as XRP can be used for long-term retirement without liquidation. Shifting Views on Retirement During the interview, Paul Barron noted that a growing number of individuals in their 40s are setting retirement goals earlier than previous generations. This reflects changing work expectations, as more people seek financial independence sooner rather than planning to remain in traditional employment for several decades. Claver explained that people typically move through different financial stages as they age. He observed that early adulthood is often shaped by learning through experience, while the following years focus on building wealth through careers, investment, and entrepreneurship. By midlife, priorities commonly shift toward restructuring personal goals and enjoying the results of earlier financial decisions. In later years, he stated that many begin to prioritize community support, knowledge sharing, and charitable work, especially when financial stability has already been secured. He added that the modern financial landscape offers more opportunities for wealth creation than previous eras, particularly because of the growth of digital assets. Diversification in Wealth Building Claver emphasized the value of diversification across all age groups. According to him, younger adults usually have a higher tolerance for risk and can allocate more resources to growth-oriented investments. As people approach retirement, he noted they tend to prefer safer assets and consistent returns. He referenced strategies commonly used by high-net-worth families. These approaches often allocate roughly 20–30% to liquid, low-risk holdings such as cash and government securities, another 20–30% toward equities, and approximately 10–20% to real estate due to its benefits for income generation and taxation. Business ownership is also an important component for wealth generation, while cryptocurrency typically represents a smaller allocation, usually between 1–5%, though more aggressive investors may choose to increase this portion based on risk preference.

He noted interest in assets including XRP, Bitcoin, HBAR, XLM, and yield products from networks such as Flare. Claver stated that DAG prioritizes helping clients establish proper structures for asset management rather than advocating for a specific product. He highlighted Wyoming as one of the most advantageous jurisdictions for digital asset ownership due to legal protections and favorable regulations. He revealed that his firm has assisted clients in forming nearly 7,500 limited liability companies in the state, many of which are used to store assets such as XRP, ETH, Solana, MATIC, Chainlink, and others. These LLCs are generally created as holding entities rather than trading entities so that assets qualify for long-term capital gains treatment and remain shielded from operational risk. He further noted that these structures can provide legal protection, as creditors cannot seize assets directly but may only request a charging order. To complement LLCs, DAG often integrates living trusts for clients. These trusts, which may be revocable or irrevocable depending on preference, ensure smooth inheritance without probate processes. Claver stated that the firm currently establishes living trusts for $500, with an upcoming increase to $1,000. Trusts can hold various assets, including digital currencies, property, vehicles, precious metals, and valuable possessions. Claver’s perspective illustrates how digital assets such as XRP can play a role in long-term retirement planning when combined with proper legal structure, diversification, and strategy. Rather than relying solely on selling tokens for profit, investors can position assets within LLCs and trusts to preserve wealth, maintain control, and pass holdings to future generations.

This analysis examines the complex technical landscape, historical precedents, and market dynamics shaping Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Support Battleground Technical analysts worldwide are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action as the cryptocurrency tests pivotal support levels established during April’s market correction. The monthly chart currently shows Bitcoin finding tentative support near its 20-month exponential moving average (EMA), a level that successfully contained the previous major correction. However, market observers note that repeated tests of this crucial zone could weaken its effectiveness over time. According to recent technical assessments, a monthly close below both the 20-month EMA and April’s low would represent a significant break in Bitcoin’s established uptrend. Such a development could potentially initiate a downward trajectory targeting the $50,000 psychological support level. This scenario gains additional credibility when examining historical patterns and market structure developments. Bearish Technical Indicators Converge on Cryptocurrency Markets Multiple technical warning signals are emerging simultaneously across different timeframes. On weekly charts, analysts observe the potential formation of a “dead cross” pattern, where the 20-week EMA threatens to fall below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This technical event last occurred in January 2022 and preceded significant market declines throughout that year. The technical landscape reveals several concerning developments: Support Level Erosion: Repeated tests of the April support zone may diminish its strength Pattern Formation: Potential Head and Shoulders pattern development suggesting trend reversal Momentum Shifts: Declining volume and weakening buying pressure across exchanges Timeframe Alignment: Bearish signals appearing simultaneously on weekly and monthly charts Bitcoin Key Technical Levels and Implications Technical Level Current Status Bullish Implication Bearish Implication 20-Month EMA Testing Support Holds as springboard for recovery Break triggers trend reversal April Low Support Under Pressure Establishes higher low pattern Confirms breakdown structure Weekly Dead Cross Forming Avoided through price recovery Confirms medium-term bearish shift $50,000 Level Psychological Support Major accumulation zone if reached Next major support if breakdown occurs Historical Context and Market Psychology Market analysts emphasize the importance of historical context when evaluating current technical developments. The cryptocurrency market has experienced similar technical setups during previous cycles, with outcomes varying based on broader market conditions, institutional participation levels, and macroeconomic factors. The current technical warnings mirror patterns observed before significant corrections in both 2018 and 2022, though market structure has evolved substantially since those periods. Institutional adoption has changed market dynamics considerably since previous bearish technical formations. Traditional financial institutions now participate more actively in cryptocurrency markets, potentially altering how technical patterns play out. However, technical analysis principles remain relevant as they reflect collective market psychology and trader behavior across all participant categories. Divergent Analyst Perspectives on Market Direction While technical charts currently favor bearish interpretations, cryptocurrency analysts remain divided about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Some market observers argue that current technical warnings may represent temporary volatility rather than sustained trend reversal. These analysts point to fundamental factors including institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and technological advancements as counterbalancing forces. Alternative perspectives suggest that technical breakdowns could represent buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Historical data shows that significant corrections often precede substantial rallies in cryptocurrency markets. However, proponents of the bearish outlook emphasize that risk management requires respecting technical warnings until proven invalid by price action. The analytical community generally agrees on several key points: Current technical setup warrants cautious positioning and risk management April support represents a critical line in the sand for market structure Volume and momentum indicators will provide crucial confirmation signals Broader market conditions will ultimately determine technical pattern outcomes Market Structure and Pattern Development Implications Technical analysts are particularly concerned about potential pattern developments that could amplify downward pressure. The possible formation of a Head and Shoulders pattern represents one such concern, as this classical technical formation typically signals trend reversal when confirmed. Pattern completion would involve breaking below the “neckline” support level, potentially triggering algorithmic selling and stop-loss orders. Market structure analysis reveals additional complexities. The relationship between spot markets and derivatives markets has created interconnected risks that can accelerate price movements in either direction. Liquidity conditions across different exchanges and trading pairs also influence how technical patterns develop and resolve. These structural factors add layers of complexity to straightforward technical interpretations. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Valuation Beyond pure technical analysis, macroeconomic conditions significantly influence cryptocurrency valuations. Interest rate policies, inflation data, and traditional market correlations all impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Current macroeconomic uncertainty creates additional headwinds for risk assets including cryptocurrencies, potentially exacerbating technical weaknesses. Historical analysis reveals that cryptocurrency markets often experience increased volatility during periods of macroeconomic transition. The current environment features multiple uncertain factors including monetary policy normalization, geopolitical tensions, and shifting regulatory landscapes. These external factors interact with technical patterns to create complex market dynamics that challenge simple predictive models. Several macroeconomic considerations currently affect cryptocurrency markets: Central bank policy shifts and their impact on risk appetite Traditional market correlations and decoupling patterns Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions Institutional adoption pace and capital flow patterns Conclusion Bitcoin price analysis reveals a cryptocurrency at a critical technical juncture, with multiple indicators warning of potential declines toward $50,000 if key support levels fail. The convergence of bearish technical signals across different timeframes warrants cautious market observation and appropriate risk management. While analyst opinions remain divided about ultimate outcomes, current technical evidence suggests respecting support level tests and pattern developments until market structure provides clearer directional signals. The coming weeks will prove crucial for determining whether Bitcoin maintains its broader uptrend or enters a more significant corrective phase. FAQs Q1: What is the 20-month EMA and why is it important for Bitcoin? The 20-month Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a technical indicator that smooths price data over 20 months, giving more weight to recent prices. It’s important because it has historically acted as dynamic support during bull markets and resistance during bear markets, making its current test significant for trend determination. Q2: How reliable are “dead cross” patterns in predicting Bitcoin price movements? While dead cross patterns (when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term one) have preceded significant declines historically, they’re not infallible predictors. Their reliability depends on confirmation from other indicators, trading volume, and broader market context. The 2022 dead cross did precede declines, but false signals can occur. Q3: What would invalidate the bearish Bitcoin technical outlook? The bearish outlook would be invalidated by a strong weekly close above current resistance levels, particularly with increasing volume. Sustained movement above the 20-week EMA with momentum confirmation would suggest the technical breakdown was false. Fundamental catalysts like major institutional adoption could also override technical warnings. Q4: How does current Bitcoin technical analysis compare to previous market cycles? Current technical warnings share similarities with 2018 and 2022 patterns but occur in a fundamentally different market context. Institutional participation, derivatives markets, and regulatory frameworks have evolved significantly. While technical patterns repeat, their outcomes may differ due to changed market structure and participant behavior. Q5: What time horizon do these Bitcoin technical warnings apply to? These technical analyses primarily address medium-term timeframes ranging from several weeks to several months. Short-term price movements can deviate from these patterns due to news events or liquidity conditions. Long-term trends require analysis of broader fundamentals including adoption metrics, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions.

56749426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258074,1767400511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Whale Accumulation: The Alarming Data Distortion That Could Mislead Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-accumulation-data-distortion/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Accumulation: The Alarming Data Distortion That Could Mislead Investors In a revelation that challenges prevailing market narratives, new analysis exposes how apparent Bitcoin whale accumulation might represent a dangerous data distortion rather than genuine institutional confidence. Senior CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno has identified critical flaws in how the cryptocurrency community interprets on-chain metrics, specifically warning that exchange wallet activities are creating misleading signals about whale behavior. This discovery comes at a crucial time for Bitcoin investors navigating complex market conditions in early 2025. Understanding the Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Narrative For years, cryptocurrency analysts have monitored whale addresses as key indicators of market sentiment. These large holders, typically controlling between 100 and 10,000 BTC, traditionally signal market direction through their accumulation or distribution patterns. However, recent data interpretations suggesting substantial whale accumulation may stem from fundamental misunderstandings of blockchain data structures. According to Moreno’s analysis, most circulating transaction data fails to properly filter exchange holdings from genuine whale activity. The cryptocurrency market has increasingly relied on on-chain analytics for investment decisions. Platforms tracking whale movements have gained significant traction among both retail and institutional investors. Nevertheless, the complexity of blockchain data interpretation presents substantial challenges. Exchange wallet reorganizations, for instance, can create artificial spikes in apparent whale activity that inexperienced analysts might misinterpret as accumulation signals. The Mechanics of On-Chain Data Distortion Blockchain analysis requires sophisticated filtering to distinguish between different types of wallet activities. Major cryptocurrency exchanges typically manage thousands of wallets containing customer funds, institutional holdings, and operational reserves. When these entities reorganize their storage systems, the movement of substantial Bitcoin amounts between addresses can appear identical to whale accumulation patterns on basic analytical platforms. Moreno emphasizes that data excluding exchange addresses actually indicates decreasing BTC holdings among genuine whales. This trend extends to addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a category that increasingly includes exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings. The distinction between ETF custodial wallets and traditional whale addresses further complicates accurate data interpretation. Expert Analysis from CryptoQuant’s Senior Analyst Julio Moreno brings substantial expertise to this analysis, with years of experience interpreting cryptocurrency market data. His previous accurate predictions about market cycles lend credibility to his current warnings about data misinterpretation. Moreno previously stated his belief that Bitcoin has already passed its cycle high and is heading toward a low, making his current analysis particularly relevant for investors assessing market direction. The implications of this data distortion extend beyond academic interest. Investment decisions based on misinterpreted whale accumulation signals could lead to substantial financial losses. Retail investors following apparent accumulation trends might enter positions at inopportune times, while institutional players could make allocation decisions based on flawed premises. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Data Interpretation Blockchain data analysis has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s inception. Early analysts worked with limited tools and basic metrics, while today’s sophisticated platforms offer hundreds of indicators. This evolution has created both opportunities and challenges for accurate market interpretation. The table below illustrates key differences between genuine whale activity and exchange-related movements: Characteristic Genuine Whale Accumulation Exchange Wallet Reorganization Transaction Pattern Consistent purchases from multiple sources Large transfers between known exchange addresses Address Behavior Long-term holding after acquisition Frequent movement between custodial wallets Timing Often correlates with market conditions Occurs during exchange infrastructure updates Data Source Reliability Requires exchange-filtered analysis Appears in unfiltered on-chain metrics Understanding these distinctions requires specialized knowledge of both blockchain technology and exchange operations. Analysts must consider multiple factors when interpreting apparent accumulation signals: Address clustering techniques to identify exchange-controlled wallets Historical behavior patterns of specific addresses Correlation with exchange announcements about wallet upgrades Verification through multiple data sources before drawing conclusions Market Impact and Investor Implications The potential misinterpretation of whale accumulation data carries significant consequences for cryptocurrency markets. Investment strategies based on flawed premises could amplify market volatility and create artificial price movements. Furthermore, the credibility of on-chain analytics as a decision-making tool faces challenges if basic metrics prove unreliable without expert interpretation. Institutional investors increasingly incorporate blockchain data into their analysis frameworks. Hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers have developed sophisticated models using whale movement indicators. The discovery of potential data distortions necessitates reevaluation of these models and their underlying assumptions. Retail investors face particular challenges in navigating this complexity. Without access to advanced analytical tools or expertise in blockchain data interpretation, they risk making decisions based on incomplete or misleading information. Educational resources about proper data interpretation become increasingly valuable in this environment. The Role of Analytical Platforms in Data Transparency CryptoQuant and similar platforms play crucial roles in improving data transparency. By developing more sophisticated filtering algorithms and educating users about interpretation challenges, these services enhance market efficiency. The ongoing development of better analytical tools represents a positive trend for cryptocurrency market maturation. Platform improvements might include: Enhanced exchange wallet identification algorithms Clear labeling of potentially distorted metrics Educational content about data interpretation limitations Multiple data visualization options showing filtered and unfiltered views Broader Trends in Cryptocurrency Market Analysis The challenge of accurate data interpretation extends beyond whale accumulation metrics. Multiple aspects of cryptocurrency analysis face similar complexities requiring expert navigation. Market participants must develop more sophisticated approaches to data evaluation as the ecosystem matures. Several trends are shaping cryptocurrency market analysis in 2025: Increased institutional participation bringing traditional financial analytical rigor Regulatory developments affecting data reporting requirements Technological advancements in blockchain analytics platforms Growing recognition of data interpretation as a specialized skill These developments collectively push the industry toward more reliable and sophisticated analytical practices. However, the transition period creates challenges for investors accustomed to simpler metrics and interpretations. Conclusion The apparent Bitcoin whale accumulation that has captured market attention may represent a significant data distortion rather than genuine institutional accumulation. Julio Moreno’s analysis highlights critical flaws in how exchange wallet activities can mimic whale behavior in unfiltered on-chain metrics. This discovery emphasizes the importance of sophisticated data interpretation in cryptocurrency markets, particularly as institutional participation increases. Investors must approach whale accumulation signals with appropriate skepticism and seek multiple verification sources before making decisions based on these metrics. The maturation of cryptocurrency markets requires parallel development in analytical sophistication, with this revelation about data distortion serving as an important milestone in that evolution. FAQs Q1: What exactly is meant by “Bitcoin whale accumulation data distortion”? This refers to the phenomenon where exchange wallet reorganizations and movements appear identical to genuine whale accumulation in basic on-chain analytics, creating misleading signals about large investor behavior. Q2: How can investors distinguish between real whale activity and exchange movements? Investors should rely on analytical platforms that filter exchange addresses, examine transaction patterns for consistency with accumulation behavior, and correlate movements with exchange infrastructure announcements rather than market conditions. Q3: Why does this data distortion matter for cryptocurrency investors? Misinterpreted whale signals could lead to poor investment timing and decisions based on flawed premises, potentially resulting in financial losses and increased market volatility. Q4: What does CryptoQuant’s analysis suggest about actual whale behavior? According to Julio Moreno’s filtered data analysis, genuine whale holdings (excluding exchange addresses) are actually decreasing, contradicting unfiltered metrics suggesting accumulation. Q5: How has cryptocurrency data analysis evolved to address these challenges? Analytical platforms have developed more sophisticated address clustering algorithms, better exchange wallet identification, and educational resources to help users properly interpret complex blockchain data.

In a Jan. 1 post on X, Jeff Yan framed “integrity” and “credible neutrality” as design constraints, not marketing language. Hyperliquid Reaffirms ‘No Insiders’ Ethos “Integrity has always been one of Hyperliquid’s core values. The house of all finance must be credibly neutral. This means no private investors, no market maker deals, and no protocol fees to any company,” he wrote , drawing a straight line between governance legitimacy and the absence of paid counterparties. That posture also extends to the origin story. “The initial state of any blockchain is a crucial part of its story that can never be erased. The original ethos of Bitcoin was a permissionless network accessible to all. Hyperliquid’s genesis distribution followed this spirit, going entirely to early users with core contributors excluded,” the post continued, adding that “the full distribution is verifiable onchain without obfuscation.” The founder acknowledged that this approach is not always convenient for would-be partners or ecosystem builders accustomed to preferential terms. “This principle of fairness frustrates a few users and builders who are used to special treatment,” he said, arguing it forces the community to “do things the hard way”, including “zero tolerance” for “integrity yellow flags” among team members. It is not the first time he has put the stance in blunt terms. In a January 2024 post, he summarized the policy as: “No investors. No paid market makers. No fees to the dev team… No insiders @HyperliquidX.” Lighter Debut Sparks Controversy The timing matters because the on-chain perpetuals category is now fighting not just over latency and liquidity, but over distribution optics, and Hyperliquid’s most visible new rival has become a live case study. Lighter, an Ethereum-based perpetual futures exchange that also operates as an Ethereum layer-2, launched earlier this week and has climbed quickly in the rankings. On Dec. 30, it airdropped 250 million LIT tokens, 25% of its 1 billion total supply, to early users, with another 25% set aside for future growth programs. The controversy is the other half. Lighter allocated 50% of supply to employees and investors, subject to a one-year lockup and three-year vesting, a structure that has triggered debate across DeFi about whether “community-first” narratives still hold when insiders retain an equal share of the cap table. In other words, Lighter’s launch has intensified the same ideological fault line Hyperliquid is trying to own: whether the cleanest on-chain market structure is primarily about product performance or about refusing the incentives that come with investors, paid liquidity, and insider allocations.

Versluis reminded the community that XRP began January 2025 at $2.08 and moved to $3.40 by the end of that month. The token then reached a yearly high of $3.66 in July before sliding back to close 2025 at $1.84, which represented an 11.5% YTD decline. “We just look at the fundamentals,” he said, adding that those who loudly predict extreme prices often end up wrong.

This change, according to the chairman, may be essential for future stock splits, as Ether’s price has a significant impact on the company’s value. Lee noted that BitMine’s share price is keeping up with Ether’s price . To effectively forecast future values, the executive carefully observed the ETH/Bitcoin ratio. Based on his argument, if, by any chance, BTC achieves a peak of $1 million, ETH would secure an all-time high of $250,000. At this point, Lee asserted that this rise would significantly increase the price of BitMine’s shares to highs he anticipated would be unreachable for many retail investors. Lee demonstrates a strong commitment to increasing the total number of BitMine’s shares In 2025, BitMine started as a Bitcoin mining and holding firm . Later, after careful consideration, the company shifted its focus to embracing an ETH treasury strategy. However, sources pointed out that BitMine continues to conduct some Bitcoin operations. Regarding his prediction, Lee declared that if ETH attained a peak of $250,000, BitMine shares could encounter an implied cost of approximately $5,000 each. Reports stated that this price is costly for several regular investors. To support this claim, the chairman mentioned that not everyone desires stocks to be priced at $500, $1,500, or $5,000; instead, a large group of individuals wants shares to be priced around $25. Meanwhile, apart from this finding, Lee also acknowledged that if ETH reaches an all-time high of $250,000, BitMine would be required to carry out a 100:1 stock split to maintain the share price at $25. With the move in place, the firm’s shares are expected to increase the total number to 43 billion. In a statement, Lee mentioned, “Right now, there are 426 million shares available. We aim to increase the authorized share count to 50 billion. However, that doesn’t mean we will actually create 50 billion shares; that’s just the highest number we want.” Reports highlighted that Lee is referring to the unit bias issue. Unit bias, in the basis of finance, is the psychological tendency for investors to prefer owning whole units of an asset (like a whole Bitcoin or share) over fractions, or to equate a low price per unit with better value, even when the total investment value is the same or a fractional amount of a pricier asset is a better investment. Lee’s idea faces criticism Regarding Lee’s proposal to increase the total number of BitMine’s shares, reports pointed out that several users shared negative responses to this suggestion on X. Some argued that it is unwise to raise the limit of authorized shares because this act would dilute the stock. This discussion made headlines, sparking controversy among individuals in the crypto ecosystem. One user remarked, “Tom, this seems shady and silly to raise the share count just because the stock could hit $500. You should wait until next year when it’s not in such bad shape.” Nonetheless, despite these concerns, recent reports highlighted that BitMine purchased approximately 32,938 ETH on Tuesday of this week for more than $102 million, based on current prices. Notably, as of December 2025, BitMine’s treasury had expanded to more than 4 million ETH, valued at over $12 billion. The firm also began staking ETH to generate income.

This investor began converting a massive $44.3 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) today, marking the end of a four-year holding period for the ETH assets. The transaction, first reported by blockchain analytics, represents one of the most notable single-asset shifts of 2025 and provides a compelling case study in long-term crypto investment strategy. Crypto Whale Executes $44.3 Million ETH to BTC Conversion According to data from AmberCN and corroborated by on-chain analysis, the whale address commenced the swap approximately five hours before reports surfaced. The entity exchanged 14,145 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) for 492 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Consequently, this transaction executed at a precise swap ratio of 1 WETH to 0.03478 WBTC. Therefore, the average purchase price for the WBTC settled at $90,014 per coin. This decisive action follows a period of accumulation that began in early 2022. Initially, the wallet accumulated a total of 22,344 ETH through major exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, and Poloniex. The average acquisition price for this Ethereum stash was $2,916 per ETH. The current move to convert a large portion into Bitcoin suggests a strategic reassessment of asset allocation. Market analysts are now scrutinizing the timing and potential motivations behind this substantial shift. Analyzing the Four-Year Holding Period and Market Context The whale’s four-year holding period is a critical piece of context. The accumulation phase in early 2022 occurred just after Ethereum’s all-time high in late 2021, during a broader market cooldown. Holding through the subsequent market cycles, including the bear market of 2022-2023 and the recovery phases, demonstrates a high-conviction, long-term approach. Now, the decision to rotate into Bitcoin may signal a change in that conviction or a tactical adjustment based on macroeconomic or protocol-specific factors. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 includes several evolving narratives. These include Bitcoin’s maturation as a institutional reserve asset, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades to its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and the regulatory clarity emerging in key jurisdictions. A whale of this size likely considers all these elements. Their move could be interpreted as a vote for Bitcoin’s relative stability or ‘digital gold’ narrative over Ethereum’s ‘world computer’ utility thesis, at least for a portion of their portfolio. Expert Perspective on Large Holder Behavior Historically, movements from large holders often precede or coincide with broader market trends. While a single transaction does not dictate market direction, it provides a valuable data point for sentiment analysis. Seasoned analysts note that whales typically move assets for several key reasons: portfolio rebalancing, risk management, capital deployment for other investments, or anticipation of specific market movements. The transparent nature of blockchain allows the market to observe these signals in real-time, adding a layer of strategic depth to crypto asset trading. The table below summarizes the key transaction details: Asset Sold Amount USD Value Holding Period Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) 14,145 $44.3 Million ~4 Years Asset Bought Amount USD Value Average Price Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) 492 $44.3 Million $90,014 per BTC Furthermore, using wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) indicates the swap likely occurred on a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or a decentralized exchange (DEX). This method offers privacy and direct asset control compared to centralized exchange transfers. The choice of instrument itself is a minor but insightful detail about the whale’s operational preferences. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The immediate market impact of a $44.3 million swap is often absorbed by liquid markets for BTC and ETH. However, the psychological impact can be more significant. Such a move can influence retail and institutional sentiment, potentially leading to increased discussion about the BTC/ETH ratio—a key metric watched by crypto traders. A shift of this scale from a long-term holder may prompt other investors to reevaluate their own allocations between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Key considerations for the market include: Sentiment Signal: Does this indicate a loss of confidence in Ethereum’s short-term prospects or a gain in confidence for Bitcoin? Technical Pressure: While $44.3M is a large sum, both ETH and BTC markets handle daily volumes in the billions. Direct price pressure may be minimal but observable. Follow-on Activity: Market participants will monitor if this whale completes the conversion of its remaining ETH holdings or if other large holders mimic the strategy. Ultimately, this event underscores the dynamic and transparent nature of cryptocurrency markets. Major player movements are public, providing a continuous stream of actionable intelligence for all market participants. It also highlights the evolving strategies within digital asset portfolio management as the asset class matures. Conclusion The $44.3 million crypto whale transaction from Ethereum to Bitcoin is a noteworthy event in the 2025 digital asset landscape. It exemplifies strategic portfolio management by large-scale investors after a multi-year holding period. While the anonymous whale’s specific motivations remain private, the move provides tangible data for analyzing market sentiment between the two premier cryptocurrencies. This action reinforces the importance of on-chain analytics and serves as a reminder that even in a decentralized ecosystem, the behavior of major holders offers crucial insights into market dynamics and evolving investment theses. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades have the potential to influence the market price due to the size of their transactions. Q2: Why use WETH and WBTC instead of native ETH and BTC? Wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) are ERC-20 token representations of native assets on the Ethereum blockchain. They are commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate seamless trading and lending without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. Q3: Does this large sale mean the whale is bearish on Ethereum? Not necessarily. Portfolio rebalancing is a common practice. The whale may still hold a significant amount of ETH (over 8,000 ETH based on reported accumulation) and might be taking profits, managing risk, or increasing exposure to Bitcoin for strategic diversification rather than expressing a purely bearish outlook on Ethereum. Q4: How can such a large trade be executed without drastically moving the price? The trade was likely executed using a decentralized exchange aggregator or a liquidity protocol that splits the order across multiple pools to achieve the best average price (a method known as ‘batch swapping’ or using ‘smart order routing’). Both BTC and ETH also have deep liquidity, allowing large orders to be filled with minimal slippage. Q5: Where can I track whale movements like this one? Several blockchain analytics platforms and services specialize in tracking large transactions and whale wallet activity. These platforms monitor blockchain data in real-time, flagging significant transfers, accumulations, and distributions from known large holders.

The annual decline was modest—around 6%—and negligible compared to historical drawdowns seen in prior bearish years. Yet despite its limited magnitude, the red close carries symbolic weight, suggesting a shift in market behavior rather than outright weakness. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Recent on-chain analysis from Axel Adler adds important context to this change. Data tracking cumulative Net Taker Flow shows that aggressive buying peaked around the New Year before fading. Since then, the balance of market aggression has tilted toward sellers, though not in an extreme way. The indicator currently sits in a moderate negative range, signaling that sell-side pressure has increased but remains far from capitulation levels. Historically, similar conditions have tended to coincide with heightened downside sensitivity rather than immediate trend reversals. In practical terms, this suggests that Bitcoin is vulnerable to further weakness if demand fails to recover, but it is not yet displaying the stress typically associated with deeper bear phases. The key takeaway is nuance. Bitcoin is not collapsing, but it is no longer behaving like an asset in a clean, momentum-driven expansion. The shift toward moderate sell pressure, combined with a rare red yearly close, points to a market transitioning into a more complex and selective phase rather than following its familiar cycle script. Derivatives Momentum Turns Cautious as Sell-Side Pressure Aligns Adler’s analysis highlights a growing shift in short-term market behavior through the Bitcoin Net Taker Flow momentum metric, which tracks how aggressively traders are positioning on the long or short side. Unlike cumulative flow, this indicator is designed to react quickly to sentiment changes, offering an early read on shifts in trader behavior rather than longer-term positioning. In recent sessions, this momentum gauge has rolled over decisively. After holding positive territory in late December, the smoothed reading has slipped into negative levels, now hovering around -0.3. While this does not yet reflect extreme stress, it places the market firmly in a moderate bearish pressure regime. The timing is notable: the momentum downturn occurred alongside a deterioration in cumulative Net Taker Flow, reinforcing the signal rather than contradicting it. This alignment matters. When both cumulative pressure and short-term momentum weaken together, it reduces the likelihood that the move is driven by noise or isolated positioning. Instead, it points to a broader shift in trader aggression toward the sell side. Adler notes that deeper downside risk would emerge if momentum continues to weaken, particularly if readings push beyond the -0.4 threshold. Conditions suggest controlled but persistent selling pressure. Bitcoin is not yet in capitulation territory, but the synchronized signals indicate that bearish forces currently have the upper hand, increasing sensitivity to any loss of price support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Distribution Re-Emerges: BTC Enters A Fragile Price Phase Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Momentum Remains Fragile Bitcoin is consolidating around the $88,000–$90,000 zone after a sharp pullback from its recent highs. Reflecting a market caught between stabilization and lingering downside risk. Price remains below the short-term and medium-term moving averages, signaling that bullish momentum has not yet been reclaimed. The 50-period moving average has turned into dynamic resistance, while the 100-period average is flattening, reinforcing the idea of a broader compression phase rather than an immediate trend reversal. Importantly, Bitcoin is still holding well above the 200-period moving average, which continues to slope upward. This suggests that, from a higher-timeframe perspective, the broader structure has not fully broken down. However, the loss of the $100,000–$105,000 region earlier marked a clear regime shift from expansion to distribution. Increasing sensitivity to sell-side pressure. Volume has notably declined during the recent sideways movement, indicating a lack of conviction from both buyers and sellers. This supports the view that the market is digesting prior excesses rather than aggressively repricing lower. Still, repeated failures to push back above the $92,000–$95,000 range highlight weak demand at higher levels. As Bitcoin holds the $85,000–$88,000 support band, consolidation remains the dominant scenario. A breakdown below this area would likely open the door to deeper retracements.

Schiff’s Bitcoin Prediction For 2026 In a Jan. 1 “Year-End Special” episode outlining his 2026 market forecasts, the renowned Bitcoin-critic argued that the cryptocurrency spent 2025 doing the one thing it wasn’t supposed to do in a year packed with pro-crypto narratives: fall. He framed that underperformance as the tell for what comes next. Schiff contrasted BTC’s year against both risk assets and his preferred macro hedges. Stocks finished 2025 higher, he cited the Dow up 13%, the S&P 500 up 16.4%, and the Nasdaq up 20.4%, while gold rose 64% and silver more than doubled. Bitcoin, he said, was the outlier on the wrong side. “Everybody on CNBC was pounding the table on when the year began was Bitcoin,” Schiff said, describing a narrative mix that included “a Bitcoin president,” “a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” heavy corporate buying, and the growth of ETFs. “Bitcoin was one of the only things that was down on the year.” He pointed to ETF performance to ground that claim, saying he checked where Bitcoin ETFs “closed because they’re done for the year,” and that they were “down just over 7.5% on the year,” even as the Nasdaq and gold posted large gains. Then he delivered the core of his setup: “If something doesn’t go up when everybody thinks it’s going to go up, that’s a pretty good indication that it’s going to go down,” he said. “If a market can’t go up on good news, that means all that good news is already priced into the market […] and that means all that it can do is go down.” Strategy As The “Poster Boy” Stress Test Schiff also used Strategy, the market’s most visible leveraged Bitcoin proxy, as his preferred diagnostic for sentiment and structural demand. He said Strategy finished 2025 at a new 52-week low and was “down 47.5% on the year” and “67% below its peak 52-week high,” calling it “the poster boy” for maximum BTC leverage. Schiff’s argument was not that Strategy failed to buy BTC but that the equity market was already pricing the downsides of the model. Schiff went further, claiming Strategy’s five-year average BTC cost basis sits around $75,000, implying only a modest gain with Bitcoin near $87,000. “That’s about a 16% gain, 3% a year over 5 years,” he said, arguing it undercut the pitch that the trade is a one-way compounding machine. He also claimed Strategy could not realistically exit at its average price without slippage, framing the “profit” as fragile in a liquidation scenario. From there, Schiff extended the thesis into 2026 market structure: if Strategy slows or stops buying, and if ETF flows flip decisively negative, marginal demand may not be there when it’s needed. “The ETFs are selling now,” he said. “They’ve gone from big Bitcoin buyers to consistent Bitcoin sellers.” While Schiff refrained from naming a BTC price target for 2026 in the video, the gold bug set a downside “minimum target” of about $50,000 mid-December 2025. He argued that Strategy could not fall as much as he expected without Bitcoin also taking a major leg lower. Year-End Special: My 2026 Economic and Market Forecasts https://t.co/pqy8bWJBjP — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 1, 2026 The Macro Backdrop Schiff’s broader 2026 macro call was a mix of weaker growth, stickier inflation, and intensifying political pressure on monetary policy, conditions he expects to support precious metals and pressure Bitcoin. He argued the Fed is already effectively back in easing mode: “it just went back to quantitative easing, even though it hasn’t officially acknowledged that that’s what it’s doing” and expects further rate cuts alongside a weakening dollar. He also tied tariffs to higher consumer prices and margin pressure, forecasting a 2026 environment where “the economy is going to be weak” while “inflation is going to be strong,” a combination he called “toxic.” Schiff’s practical conclusion for crypto listeners was direct: he urged viewers to “get rid of your Bitcoin above $87,000,” while reiterating that he expects capital to rotate toward gold and silver as “the bloom comes off that crypto […] tulip.” At press time, BTC traded at $89,517.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Peter Schiff,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

This incremental yet significant one-point rise, reported by data provider Alternative on April 10, 2025, follows the index’s crucial migration from the ‘Extreme Fear’ category into the ‘Fear’ category just a day prior, potentially foreshadowing a change in market dynamics. Consequently, analysts and traders are scrutinizing this movement for clues about future price action and capital flows. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Climbs: Decoding the 29 Reading The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it quantifies sentiment where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 29, therefore, firmly places the market in the ‘Fear’ zone, but notably on an upward trajectory away from the extreme pessimism that often characterizes market bottoms. This index does not rely on a single metric; instead, it synthesizes data from six distinct sources to provide a holistic view. Specifically, its calculation incorporates: Market Volatility (25%): Current price swings compared to historical averages. Market Volume (25%): Trading activity and momentum on major exchanges. Social Media (15%): The volume and sentiment of crypto mentions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polling data from various community platforms. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. The recent climb to 29 suggests positive momentum across several of these components, particularly in trading volume and social media sentiment, which have historically led shifts in the broader index. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis Understanding the importance of the move to 29 requires examining historical patterns. For instance, prolonged periods in ‘Extreme Fear’ (typically below 25) have frequently coincided with accumulation phases, where long-term investors enter the market. The index’s escape from this territory often precedes periods of consolidation or gradual recovery. By contrast, a sustained move above 50 into ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ has historically correlated with market peaks and increased risk. The current reading, therefore, represents a transitional phase. Market analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often cross-reference this sentiment data with on-chain metrics, such as exchange net flows and holder composition, to validate the sentiment shift. Their recent reports indicate a decrease in coins moving to exchanges for sale, aligning with the less fearful sentiment reading. Expert Insight: The Mechanics of Sentiment Shifts Dr. Lena Vance, a behavioral finance economist at the Digital Asset Research Institute, explains the underlying mechanics. “The Fear & Greed Index is powerful because it quantifies the herd mentality,” she states. “A move from 20 to 29 may seem small, but in behavioral terms, it reflects a measurable reduction in panic-driven decision-making. Investors are beginning to process information more rationally, rather than reacting purely to negative headlines or short-term volatility.” This perspective is supported by data from the past month, which shows a stabilization in Bitcoin’s realized volatility and a modest increase in stablecoin inflows to exchanges—a potential precursor to buying pressure. Furthermore, the index’s weighting of social media sentiment captures the nuanced shift from apocalyptic narratives to more balanced discussions about protocol upgrades and regulatory clarity. The Impact of Volatility and Trading Volume The two heaviest-weighted components of the index—volatility and trading volume—deserve particular attention. Over the last fortnight, the 30-day volatility for Bitcoin has contracted by approximately 15%, according to data from TradingView. This compression often indicates a coiling period that can precede a significant price movement. Simultaneously, aggregate spot trading volume across major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken has risen by an estimated 8%. This combination of lower volatility and higher volume can signal the early stages of informed accumulation, as opposed to speculative frenzy. The table below illustrates the recent trend in these key metrics: Metric 30 Days Ago Current Reading Change Impact on Index BTC 30-Day Volatility 68% 58% -14.7% Positive for Sentiment Aggregate Daily Volume $42B $45.5B +8.3% Positive for Sentiment Social Sentiment Score 28/100 35/100 +25% Positive for Sentiment This data-driven improvement directly feeds into the index’s calculation, providing a factual basis for the climb to 29. Broader Market Implications and Future Trajectory The easing sentiment captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not exist in a vacuum. It interacts with macro-financial conditions, including interest rate expectations and global liquidity. In early 2025, with central banks in a holding pattern, cryptocurrency markets are finding their own footing based on internal supply dynamics and adoption milestones. A sentiment reading in the ‘Fear’ zone, but rising, typically suggests a market that is healing but remains vulnerable to negative shocks. For portfolio managers, this environment often dictates a strategy of phased re-entry or dollar-cost averaging, rather than all-in speculation. The index also provides a contrarian indicator for retail investors; historically, buying during periods of sustained fear has yielded positive long-term returns, though past performance is never a guarantee of future results. The key watchpoint now is whether the index can sustain its move and challenge the neutral level of 50, which would require consistent positive inflows and a supportive macro backdrop. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 29 represents a meaningful, data-backed shift in market psychology from extreme pessimism toward cautious optimism. This movement, driven by improvements in volatility, trading volume, and social sentiment, provides a quantifiable snapshot of a market in transition. While firmly remaining in the ‘Fear’ category, the upward trajectory suggests that the peak of investor capitulation may have passed, allowing for a more stable foundation for price discovery. Market participants should monitor this index alongside on-chain fundamentals and macroeconomic developments, as the journey from fear to greed is rarely linear. The current reading of 29 offers a hopeful sign that the market is processing information more calmly, a necessary step for sustainable long-term growth. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 29 mean? A reading of 29 places the market in the ‘Fear’ category, but on an upward trend from ‘Extreme Fear.’ It indicates that negative sentiment is easing, though investors remain generally cautious rather than optimistic or greedy. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is compiled and published daily by the data provider Alternative. It aggregates real-time data from volatility, volume, social media, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of Bitcoin’s price? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. It reflects current market emotion. Historically, sustained extreme fear has often preceded price rebounds, while extreme greed has signaled market tops, but it should be used alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools. Q4: Why is Bitcoin’s market dominance a factor in the index? Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. Shifts in dominance often reflect risk appetite; investors may flee to Bitcoin (‘digital gold’) during fear and into altcoins during greed, making it a useful sentiment gauge. Q5: How should a trader or investor use this index? Primarily as a contrarian indicator and a gauge of market temperature. Extreme readings can signal potential turning points. A rising index from fear levels, like the current move to 29, can suggest it’s time to research opportunities, but never to base a trade solely on this single metric.

This critical metric, updated on a continuous basis, provides a data-driven snapshot of capital rotation between the flagship cryptocurrency and the broader altcoin universe. Consequently, investors and analysts are closely monitoring this figure for early signs of a potential regime shift, as historical patterns suggest these cycles dictate portfolio performance for months. The current reading, far from the 75 threshold needed to declare an ‘altcoin season,’ underscores a period where Bitcoin continues to command market leadership and investor preference. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Mechanics CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index operates on a transparent and methodical calculation. Fundamentally, the index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. However, the algorithm makes crucial exclusions to ensure clarity; it deliberately filters out stablecoins like USDT and USDC, alongside wrapped tokens such as WBTC, which merely mirror Bitcoin’s price. The core calculation is straightforward: it measures the percentage of these top 100 assets that have outperformed Bitcoin. A result of 75% or higher triggers the official declaration of an altcoin season, a condition last observed in early 2021. Conversely, a score below 25 strongly suggests a Bitcoin season, where the pioneer cryptocurrency outshines most alternatives. The current score of 23 sits precisely within this Bitcoin-dominant territory. The Historical Context of Market Cycles Understanding the index’s current position requires examining past crypto market cycles. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the charge, attracting institutional and mainstream capital first. Subsequently, as Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates at higher levels, investor appetite for risk increases, leading capital to flow into altcoins with higher growth potential—this is the classic altcoin season. For instance, the index surged above 75 for extended periods during the 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 bull runs. The prolonged period since 2022, however, has been characterized by lower index readings, reflecting a post-bear market environment where safety and established store-of-value narratives favor Bitcoin. This cyclical rhythm between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance is a well-documented phenomenon in cryptocurrency market analysis. Implications of a Score of 23 for Investors The index’s low reading carries significant practical implications for portfolio strategy. Primarily, it suggests that a momentum-based approach focused solely on altcoins may underperform relative to a strategy with Bitcoin exposure. Market data from similar periods shows that during strong Bitcoin seasons, capital tends to be concentrated, leaving many altcoins struggling for momentum. Therefore, investors might prioritize Bitcoin and perhaps the largest, most liquid altcoins (often called ‘blue-chip’ alts) during this phase. Nevertheless, a low index can also signal a potential accumulation phase for selective altcoins before a possible rotation. Seasoned analysts often view extreme readings in either direction as potential contrarian indicators, though timing such shifts remains notoriously difficult. Key characteristics of a Bitcoin-dominant market (Index below 25) include: Heightened focus on macroeconomic factors like interest rates and inflation. Strong relative performance of Bitcoin against the total crypto market cap (BTC Dominance). Reduced trading volumes and volatility across smaller altcoin projects. Increased narrative strength around Bitcoin as a digital gold and institutional asset. Expert Analysis on Current Market Structure Market structure experts point to several concurrent factors explaining the low Altcoin Season Index. First, the regulatory environment in 2024-2025 has created uncertainty for many altcoin projects, particularly those deemed securities by regulators. This uncertainty naturally benefits Bitcoin, which has achieved clearer regulatory status in major markets like the United States. Second, the successful launch and adoption of Bitcoin spot ETFs have funneled billions in traditional finance capital directly into Bitcoin, creating a demand shock that altcoins have not yet experienced. Finally, the broader risk-off sentiment in global markets, influenced by geopolitical tensions, has made investors cautious about the high-beta nature of most altcoins. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s dominance, as reflected in the index score. Comparing Alternative Market Health Indicators While the Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool, prudent analysts cross-reference it with other metrics. For example, the Bitcoin Dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, often correlates strongly with this index. Other useful indicators include the performance ratio of Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) and the collective market cap of altcoins excluding the top 10. Currently, most of these complementary metrics align with the Altcoin Season Index’s message. The ETH/BTC ratio, a bellwether for altcoin strength, has remained in a downtrend or consolidation pattern, further validating the index’s low reading. This confluence of data from multiple sources strengthens the reliability of the current market diagnosis. The Path Forward: Monitoring for a Regime Shift Market participants are now watching for catalysts that could push the Altcoin Season Index higher. Potential triggers include decisive regulatory clarity for altcoins, the approval of spot ETFs for assets like Ethereum, or a sustained period of sideways movement in Bitcoin’s price that prompts investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. Historically, the transition from a Bitcoin season to an altcoin season is not instantaneous; it is a gradual process where the index climbs from lows, through a neutral zone, and finally breaches the 75 level. Therefore, a sustained move above the 50 level would be the first technical signal of strengthening altcoin momentum. Until then, the market structure favors the incumbent. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, registering at 23, delivers a clear and data-backed message: the cryptocurrency market remains in a phase of Bitcoin dominance. This reading, derived from the comparative performance of the top 100 assets, is a crucial tool for navigating complex market cycles. While it presents challenges for altcoin investors in the short term, it also provides a framework for anticipating future rotations. Ultimately, understanding this index allows for more informed, strategic decisions aligned with the prevailing market regime. As the crypto landscape evolves, this metric will continue to serve as an essential barometer for the ever-shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and the expansive world of altcoins. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 23 mean? It means that only an estimated 23% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. This indicates a market strongly favoring Bitcoin, known as a ‘Bitcoin season.’ Q2: How often is CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is calculated and updated on a continuous, real-time basis by CoinMarketCap, reflecting the most recent 90-day rolling performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q3: Has the index ever been wrong in predicting market cycles? The index is a descriptive metric, not a predictive one. It reports on what has already happened over a 90-day period. While it is an excellent indicator of the current trend, past performance does not guarantee future results, and external shocks can change market dynamics rapidly. Q4: Should I avoid altcoins entirely when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index suggests a challenging environment for broad altcoin momentum, but it can also be a period for researching and accumulating fundamentally strong projects at lower valuations. Portfolio allocation should always align with individual risk tolerance and investment horizon. Q5: What is the difference between this index and the ‘Bitcoin Dominance’ metric? Bitcoin Dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. The Altcoin Season Index measures price performance over time. While they often trend together, they are different measurements; one is a snapshot of value share, and the other is a snapshot of momentum performance.

Currently hovering just above $89,200, Bitcoin recently saw its 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages (SMAs) cross paths on December 8, a development highlighted by market analyst Ali Martinez on social media site X (previously Twitter). Bitcoin May Face 50%-60% Correction Martinez emphasized the importance of watching the behavior of these two moving averages on the weekly chart. Historically, each time Bitcoin has registered a death cross between the 10-week and 50-week SMAs, it has been followed by substantial corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 As seen in the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart below, past occurrences of such crossovers have led to price declines of 67% in September 2014, 54% in June 2018, 53% in March 2020, and 64% in January 2022. With the recent death cross-forming, Martinez suggests that if history is any guide, Bitcoin could face a correction between 50% and 60%, which would place its price anywhere between $50,000 and $38,000. Adding another layer of complexity to the analysis, market expert Mags has outlined two potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s near future. Two Scenarios For BTC’s Future Following Bitcoin’s downturn since its October highs above $126,000, it has been trading around the $85,000 mark for several weeks. Coinciding with this, Tether’s USDT dominance has broken out of its previous range, currently maintaining levels above the breakout zone. Since Bitcoin and USDT dominance exhibit an inverse correlation, Mags has identified two main scenarios moving forward. The first, a bullish scenario, hinges on the idea that if USDT dominance begins to decline, the current breakout could turn out to be a fakeout. Mags asserts that such a move could potentially ignite another expansion in Bitcoin’s price, possibly even leading to a new all-time high before any significant distribution occurs. Related Reading: Here’s How Much The XRP Price Will Be If It Overtakes Ethereum In Market Cap Conversely, Mags outlined a second scenario indicating early signs of a bearish structure. If the broader market trend weakens, Bitcoin might experience a temporary bounce, while USDT dominance forms a higher low near its mid-range before trending back upwards. In this case, BTC would exhibit a slow distribution pattern, marking neither a crash nor a rapid decline, but rather a gradual, choppy downward movement characteristic of initial bearish market behavior. The next move in USDT dominance is poised to play a crucial role in determining whether the current market represents a mere pause before further price continuation or the onset of an extended distribution phase leading up to a new all-time high.

Analyst Thinks So—Here’s Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-heading-0-08-analyst-thinks-heres-why/,newsbtc,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin could be on track for $0.08 based on this breakout from a consolidation channel. Dogecoin Has Fallen Under An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where Dogecoin could be heading based on a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Channel,” which is a type of Parallel Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Defined by Demand, Not Price: CryptoQuant Head Says Parallel Channels appear whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. When these lines have a positive slope, the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. This channel corresponds to consolidation that occurs toward some net upside. Like other such patterns in TA, the upper line acts a source of resistance, while the lower one provides support. A break out of either of these boundaries can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel may be a bullish signal, while a drop under it a bearish one. Like the Ascending Channel, there is also a pattern in TA called the Descending Channel, emerging when the opposite type of consolidation takes place. That is, when the price moves to a net downside between two parallel trendlines with a negative slope. Until recently, Dogecoin had been trading inside a multi-year Ascending Channel on the 3-day timeframe. The memecoin capped off 2025 with a breakout from it, as the chart shared by Martinez shows. From the above graph, it’s apparent that Dogecoin has escaped the long Ascending Channel with a fall below the support trendline. The memecoin has since been following a steep downward trajectory, a potential sign that the bearish breakout is in effect. Breakouts from Parallel Channels are considered likely to end up being of the same height as the distance between the trendlines. Based on this, the analyst has put the $0.08 target for DOGE. It now remains to be seen whether the asset will follow this trajectory or if it will see a rebound before long. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case In another X post, Martinez has highlighted how Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has also been trading inside a TA consolidation pattern recently. As displayed in the chart, the pattern in the case of Bitcoin is a Symmetrical Triangle, a channel that involves two lines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. BTC’s 4-hour price has been moving sideways in this pattern recently and based on its height, the analyst thinks that the coin may be set up for a 15% move. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.13, up more than 8% over the last 24 hours.

56754795,651974,1767412808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56754795.jpeg,Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Return To Losses Despite Elevated Price Levels – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/short-term-bitcoin-holders-return-losses-price/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin closed 2025 with a modest annual loss, breaking the familiar pattern of strong year-end performance and reinforcing growing concerns that the market may be transitioning into a more challenging phase in 2026. As macro uncertainty, fading liquidity, and weak risk appetite weigh on sentiment, an increasing number of analysts are openly discussing the possibility of a prolonged bear market. Still, price action tells a more nuanced story. Bitcoin remains locked in consolidation, and the absence of aggressive downside continuation has opened the door to a potential relief rally in the near term. On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds important context to this setup. Recent metrics show that short-term holders—investors who typically drive momentum during trend expansions—have slipped back into net losses. Aggregate realized profit and loss for this group has turned negative again, with margins hovering near -12%. This deterioration is notable because it is occurring while Bitcoin’s price remains relatively elevated compared to previous cycle drawdowns, suggesting that stress is building beneath the surface rather than after a full capitulation. Historically, periods where short-term holders operate at a loss often coincide with late-stage corrections or consolidation phases within broader market transitions. While this does not confirm a market bottom, it highlights fragility in near-term demand and reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is at a critical inflection point as 2026 approaches. Short-Term Holder Stress Signals a Market at a Crossroads Recent on-chain observations suggest Bitcoin is entering a delicate phase where short-term holders are increasingly under strain. When newer market participants slip into losses, it often signals that price has moved faster than incoming demand can comfortably absorb. In past cycles, this condition has typically appeared near the later stages of corrections or during extended sideways phases, rather than at the start of deep bear markets. What makes the current setup notable is Bitcoin’s proximity to the average acquisition price of short-term holders. This zone has historically acted as a psychological and behavioral battleground. When price hovers near this level, market reactions tend to intensify, as traders decide whether to cut losses or hold through uncertainty. The outcome often defines whether consolidation continues or volatility expands. Importantly, the scale of losses remains moderate compared to historical capitulation events. Previous market resets, such as those seen in 2018 or mid-2022, were characterized by far deeper and more prolonged stress among short-term holders. The absence of similar extremes today suggests that, while sentiment is weak, the broader market structure has not yet broken down. That said, persistent pressure on short-term holders reflects fragile near-term demand. If losses begin to narrow, it could signal stabilization and set the stage for a relief move. If they widen instead, downside moves are more likely to accelerate. Bitcoin Consolidates Below $90K Bitcoin price action on the 3-day chart shows a clear transition from trend expansion to consolidation following the sharp correction from the $120K–$125K region. After losing the 50-day and 100-day moving averages during the November breakdown, BTC accelerated lower before finding demand in the mid-$80K zone. Since then, price has stabilized and is now compressing just below $90K, suggesting that downside momentum has slowed materially. The current structure reflects a market in equilibrium rather than capitulation. Bitcoin is trading above the 200-day moving average, which continues to slope upward, preserving the broader bullish structure from a higher-timeframe perspective. However, the declining 50-day and 100-day averages overhead are acting as dynamic resistance, capping upside attempts and preventing a clean trend reversal for now. Selling pressure peaked during the November decline, but recent candles show reduced volume, consistent with seller exhaustion rather than aggressive accumulation. This often precedes a range-bound phase where the market digests prior gains. From a technical standpoint, holding the $85K–$88K region is critical. A sustained defense of this area keeps the consolidation intact and opens the door for a relief rally toward the $95K–$100K zone. Conversely, a decisive loss of this support would expose Bitcoin to a deeper retracement toward the 200-day average, shifting the short-term bias back to the downside.

His release took place on January 2, 2026, several years before the completion of his original sentence. Lichtenstein credited his early release to provisions under the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform law signed in 2018, which allows sentence reductions for inmates who participate in rehabilitation programs and demonstrate good conduct. How the First Step Act Led to an Early Release Lichtenstein was arrested in February 2022 alongside his wife, Heather Morgan, after US authorities traced nearly 120,000 BTC stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the arrest, the stolen Bitcoin was valued at approximately $4.5 billion, making it one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in US history. In November 2024, Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to money laundering conspiracy. However, according to his statement following release, his participation in rehabilitation and educational programs made him eligible for sentence reduction under the First Step Act. From a Mid-Market Bitcoin Era to a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Asset When the Bitfinex hack occurred in August 2016, Bitcoin was trading at roughly $600–$650 per coin. At those prices, the 120,000 BTC stolen during the breach were valued at approximately $72–$78 million, a substantial amount at the time but within a far smaller and less developed crypto market. Nearly a decade later, Bitcoin trades at levels that fundamentally reshape the historical significance of the incident. With Bitcoin priced around $90,000 in early 2026, the same 120,000 BTC would now be worth approximately $10.8 billion, representing an increase of more than 140 times compared with its estimated value at the time of the hack. Cooperation With Authorities Played a Role Beyond rehabilitation efforts, Lichtenstein cooperated with US authorities during ongoing investigations. In 2024, he testified in the case involving the cryptocurrency mixer Bitcoin Fog. The operator of the service was later sentenced to 12.5 years in prison, a development prosecutors cited as a significant enforcement milestone. Heather Morgan received a more lenient sentence of 18 months in prison and was released in October 2025 after serving approximately eight months. Following her arrest, she gained widespread attention on social media for her musical project under the pseudonym Razzlekhan, which became a viral internet phenomenon. What the Case Signals for Crypto Enforcement Lichtenstein’s release comes amid broader discussion about how the US justice system handles cryptocurrency-related crimes. In recent years, sentencing outcomes have increasingly reflected cooperation, restitution efforts, and rehabilitation rather than punishment alone. Following his release, Lichtenstein stated that he plans to use his technical background in cybersecurity, marking a notable shift from one of the most high-profile crypto crime cases toward a potential role in digital security. The case underscores how enforcement strategies and sentencing frameworks in the crypto sector continue to evolve as authorities balance deterrence, recovery of assets, and long-term reintegration.",News|Legal,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,0,0,EN,"{

This significant inflow, led dominantly by financial giant BlackRock, completely erased the prior day’s outflows and signaled robust institutional appetite for cryptocurrency exposure at the start of the new trading year. The data, compiled by industry tracker TraderT, provides a clear snapshot of investor sentiment and capital movement within this pivotal financial instrument category. Bitcoin ETF Inflow Breakdown and Market Leaders BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) commanded the day’s activity, single-handedly drawing $280.12 million in net inflows. Consequently, this massive vote of confidence from investors solidified IBIT’s position as the category leader. Other major issuers also reported positive flows, creating a broad-based rally. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $88.08 million, while Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) gathered $41.49 million. Furthermore, several other funds contributed to the total, including Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($12.99M), VanEck’s HODL ($8.26M), Ark Invest’s ARKB ($6.71M), and Invesco’s BTCO ($4.47M). Notably, Grayscale’s offerings also participated, with its flagship GBTC adding $15.42 million and its Mini BTC Trust attracting $6.35 million. The following table summarizes the key inflows for January 2, 2025: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (USD) IBIT BlackRock $280.12M FBTC Fidelity $88.08M BITB Bitwise $41.49M EZBC Franklin Templeton $12.99M Contextualizing the Spot Bitcoin ETF Phenomenon The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024 represented a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike futures-based products, these funds hold physical bitcoin, providing direct exposure to the asset’s price. This structure appeals to a wide range of investors, from large institutions to financial advisors and retail participants. The January 2nd inflow data is particularly noteworthy because it follows a period of typical year-end portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, which often pressures asset prices. Therefore, the strong start to 2025 suggests a renewal of strategic, long-term allocation rather than short-term speculation. Market analysts often interpret consistent ETF inflows as a measure of sustained institutional demand. These flows require the ETF issuer to purchase equivalent amounts of bitcoin on the open market to back the new shares. This process creates a direct, mechanical buy-pressure on the underlying asset. Over time, this dynamic can significantly impact bitcoin’s supply and demand equilibrium, especially considering its fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Trends Financial experts point to several factors driving this renewed interest. First, macroeconomic conditions, including monetary policy expectations, can influence asset allocation decisions. Second, the maturation of cryptocurrency custody and regulatory frameworks has reduced perceived operational risks for large institutions. Third, the competitive fee structures among ETF issuers, with some even offering temporary fee waivers, have made access more cost-effective. The dominance of traditional asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity in the inflow rankings underscores their existing, vast distribution networks and client trust, which are effectively channeling capital into the digital asset space. The trajectory of these funds is also closely watched for its impact on bitcoin’s market structure. As ETF holdings grow, the proportion of bitcoin supply considered “locked” in long-term investment vehicles increases. This trend potentially reduces the liquid supply available for trading, which can decrease market volatility and increase price stability over the long term. However, analysts caution that outflow days will also occur, reflecting normal market cycles and profit-taking behavior. Comparative Performance and Market Impact When comparing the performance of different spot Bitcoin ETFs, factors beyond daily flows become critical. Investors and advisors typically evaluate expense ratios, liquidity (as measured by average daily trading volume), and the reputation of the custodian safeguarding the assets. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have consistently led in net asset gathering since their launches, benefiting from their globally recognized brands and extensive relationships with wirehouses and registered investment advisors (RIAs). The collective action of these ETFs has several tangible market impacts: Price Discovery: They integrate bitcoin pricing into traditional equity market hours and systems. Accessibility: They provide a familiar, regulated wrapper for exposure, bypassing the complexities of direct custody. Legitimization: Their existence and growth signal regulatory acceptance to a broader investor base. Data from the broader blockchain ecosystem often reflects ETF activity. On days of substantial net inflows, on-chain analysts may observe larger-than-normal transfers of bitcoin to known custodian addresses, such as Coinbase Custody, which secures assets for multiple ETF issuers. This on-chain transparency provides a secondary layer of verification for the reported flow data. Conclusion The $463.9 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 2, 2025, marks a decisive and optimistic start to the year for cryptocurrency investment products. Led by BlackRock’s IBIT, this collective movement of capital demonstrates resilient institutional demand and a swift recovery from prior outflows. As these regulated vehicles continue to mature, their flow data will remain a crucial barometer for measuring mainstream financial adoption of digital assets like bitcoin. The sustained growth of these funds not only impacts bitcoin’s market dynamics but also solidifies the asset’s position within the modern, diversified investment portfolio. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds physical bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Q2: Why are net inflows important for Bitcoin ETFs? Net inflows are crucial because they represent new capital entering the fund. The issuer must use this cash to purchase an equivalent amount of bitcoin, creating direct buy-side pressure on the market. Consistent inflows indicate growing investor demand and can influence bitcoin’s price. Q3: What was the significance of the January 2, 2025, inflow data? The $463.9 million inflow was significant because it represented a strong reversal from outflows on the previous day. It signaled renewed institutional investment interest at the very beginning of the new trading year, often interpreted as a positive sentiment indicator. Q4: How does BlackRock’s IBIT differ from Grayscale’s GBTC? Both are investment products offering bitcoin exposure, but they have different structures. IBIT is a newly launched spot ETF with a competitive management fee. GBTC was converted from a closed-end trust into a spot ETF. Their fee structures, historical performance, and liquidity profiles differ, influencing investor choice. Q5: Do Bitcoin ETF flows directly cause bitcoin’s price to rise? While not the sole factor, significant net inflows contribute to upward price pressure. The ETF issuer’s market purchases to back new shares increase demand. However, bitcoin’s price is also affected by global macroeconomic factors, broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, and technological developments.

56757720,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888062,1767419400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56757720.jpeg,Moreno says Bitcoin is still distributing their assets instead of accumulating,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-whale-accumulation-overhyped/,cryptopolitan,"A dominant narrative about Bitcoin whales quietly hoarding BTC and bracing for a breakout has been upended by new on-chain analytics, which instead hint there is ongoing distribution among the largest holders — potentially dampening near-term bullish sentiment. Despite recent headlines proclaiming that large BTC wallets have been aggressively buying the dip, deeper blockchain data reveals a more nuanced reality. The head of research at the platform, Julius Moreno, cautioned that what appears to be whale accumulation is actually exchange-related activity inflating perceptions of buying. Exchanges frequently reorganize funds into other wallets, thereby increasing the number of wallets with massive balances . Moreno commented on X: “No, whales are not buying an enormous amount of Bitcoin. Most BTC whale data out there has been ‘affected’ by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances. This is why whales seem to have accumulated a lot of coins recently.” Blockchain analytics firms report that long-term Bitcoin holders — wallets that have held their BTC for extended periods — have shifted back into net distribution after a prolonged accumulation phase. The Coinbase executive comments come as sentiment among crypto market participants on social media has started the year strong, according to a Santiment analyst, who warned that further market upside depends on retail investors staying level-headed. “We need retail to continue to be a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, a bit impatient,” Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said in a video published to YouTube on Saturday. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators showing fear among market participants, Quinlivan said Santiment’s social media data points in the opposite direction. Moreno says Bitcoin is still distributing their assets instead of accumulating Moreno noted that adjusted data show that large holders are still in distribution mode, and not accumulation. The data also shows a continued drop in whale holdings, alongside falling balances among 100–1,000 BTC addresses, suggesting ETF outflows persist. Large holders typically make significant changes in the Bitcoin price; however, the market structure is adapting with the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have become substantial market participants. Aside from questions about whale accumulation, sentiment among long-term BTC holders has improved, as indicated by other onchain metrics. According to Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck , long-term Bitcoin holders have once again begun buying after suffering the biggest selling period in years. The trend suggests that the recent selling pressure on BTC might be beginning to ease. The recovery of Bitcoin remains tentative, although downside pressure to date hasn’t forced prices back to the sub-$80,000 range seen in November. BTC is currently trading just above the $90,000 mark. Nonetheless, Bollinger Bands, a key volatility gauge, suggest that a major price swing may be imminent.TradingView data shows Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands—the volatility bands set two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average—have tightened to under $3,500, the narrowest since July. Back in late July, a Bollinger Band squeeze capped a two-week consolidation between $115,000 and $120,000, marking the start of a three-month price expansion that ranged from $100,000 to $126,000. A similar pattern emerged in late February, with Bitcoin consolidating between $94,000 and $98,000 before a Bollinger Band squeeze preceded a decline to $80,000. Kim says Bitcoin will surpass $270,000 by February 2026 The social media predictor and self-proclaimed world’s smartest man, Kim, recently predicted that BTC could jump past $270,000 within a month next year. According to reports, the predictor cited both the growth and fragility of fiat currencies as reasons for his optimistic outlook, noting Bitcoin’s historical volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic trends. The social media personality has made several Bitcoin forecasts in the past that have not held up. He predicted in November that Bitcoin would more than double to $220,000 within 45 days, pledging any future profits toward church construction, yet the price surge never materialized. In addition to his bullish calls, Kim said BTC could replace the US dollar by 2026, labeling the current low as a short-term, manipulation-driven discount.

Related Reading: Ethereum Optimism For 2026: Analysts Share Bullish Forecast Despite Disappointing End-Of-Year Bitcoin Records Least Volatile Year On Friday, K33 Research data revealed that Bitcoin has recorded the least volatile year in the asset’s history. According to the chart, the flagship cryptocurrency saw its lowest volatility level, measured by the average deviation of daily returns, in 2025, hitting just 2.24%. The recent data shows that BTC fell below the previous lowest year on record, 2023, which registered 2.30% volatility. Moreover, it’s annual volatility has also ended below the 3% mark over the past three years, its lowest levels since 2016. This signals a “clear” diminishing trend, K33 Research noted, as Bitcoin’s volatility has been trending lower year by year, suggesting growing market maturity and stabilizing price action. Crypto trader Niels highlighted that “for the first time, BTC recorded its lowest annual volatility on record, lower than every cycle before it, including the early ‘wild west’ years and the post-ETF era.” As he explained, 2025 was “the calmest year in Bitcoin’s history” despite all the price movements of the years, including the Q4 daily corrections, which saw the flagship crypto retrace up to 16% in a single day. It’s worth noting that BTC’s deepest correction in 2025 saw the cryptocurrency drop nearly 36% in a two-month period, while previous cycles’ corrections recorded retraces of more than 50% during similar periods. Previously, Nic Carter addressed the negative sentiment brewing around Bitcoin and the broader market. He detailed that the market could be considered “boring” now because most of the questions that drove the historical volatility have been answered. Carter also asserted that the space matured significantly with “more serious businesses (…), [and] less chaos” in the industry. The Start Of The ‘Institutional Era’ In his X post, Niels also pointed out that the diminishing trend in Bitcoin volatility was fueled by the massive institutional participation, calling for “More capital. More long-term holders. More institutional participation. [and] Less emotional trading” for the future. Similarly, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley has affirmed that the overall crypto market was changing, driven by the significant decrease in regulatory risk, which has led to last year’s spike in institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. Notably, the market saw the second of wave of crypto Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) go live, with funds based on altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP breaking multiple records. In addition, the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) trend, led by Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, poured billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies in 2025. Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report In November, Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood stated that growing institutional adoption will be a powerful driver for long-term value for Bitcoin, noting that large-scale institutions have barely dipped their toes into the space and “have a long way to go.” Meanwhile, Head of Research at Grayscale, Zach Pandl, said in an January 2 interview that 2026 could be the “dawn of the institutional era” for crypto. He noted that rising demand for alternative stores of value and progress on bipartisan US crypto market structure legislation could drive Bitcoin to new highs in the first half of the year. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,240, a 1.54% increase in the daily timeframe.

56757993,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258131,1767420012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidations-short-squeeze/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a dramatic cascade of liquidations totaling approximately $250 million over a critical 24-hour period, with short positions bearing the overwhelming brunt of the losses. This substantial crypto futures liquidations event represents one of the most significant short squeeze scenarios in recent months, highlighting the inherent volatility and leverage risks within digital asset derivatives markets. According to comprehensive data from leading analytics platforms, Ethereum (ETH) led the liquidation wave with $120 million, followed closely by Bitcoin (BTC) at $108 million, while Solana (SOL) experienced $21.95 million in forced position closures. Crypto Futures Liquidations: Understanding the Market Mechanics The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event provides a textbook example of market dynamics in leveraged trading environments. Perpetual futures contracts, which dominate cryptocurrency derivatives trading, allow traders to use significant leverage—often 10x to 100x their initial capital. Consequently, even relatively modest price movements can trigger automatic position closures when maintenance margin requirements fail. Market analysts note that this particular liquidation wave occurred during a period of unexpected bullish momentum across major digital assets. The resulting short squeeze forced cascading position closures as prices moved against traders betting on declines. Derivatives markets serve crucial functions for price discovery and risk management. However, they also amplify volatility through leverage effects. When numerous traders hold similar directional positions with high leverage, the market becomes vulnerable to liquidation cascades. These events typically unfold rapidly as initial liquidations create additional selling or buying pressure. This pressure then triggers further liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. The cryptocurrency market’s 24/7 operation means these events can develop at any time, often catching traders off guard during low-liquidity periods. The Anatomy of a Short Squeeze A short squeeze represents a specific market condition where traders who have sold assets expecting price declines must urgently buy them back to cover their positions. This covering activity creates additional upward buying pressure, which then forces more short positions to liquidate. The resulting feedback loop can produce rapid, dramatic price increases. Historical data from traditional finance shows similar patterns in equity markets, though cryptocurrency markets exhibit amplified effects due to higher leverage availability and continuous trading. Ethereum Leads With $120 Million in Liquidations Ethereum’s derivatives market experienced the most substantial impact during this crypto futures liquidations event, with $120 million in positions forcibly closed. Remarkably, short positions accounted for 89.48% of these liquidations, indicating overwhelming directional consensus among leveraged traders. This percentage translates to approximately $107.38 million in short positions liquidated against just $12.62 million in long positions. The disparity highlights how market sentiment had become excessively bearish on Ethereum before the price movement that triggered the squeeze. Several factors contributed to Ethereum’s prominent role in this liquidation event. First, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization with exceptionally deep derivatives markets. Second, ongoing network upgrades and regulatory developments create uncertainty that encourages leveraged positioning. Third, Ethereum’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets means it often moves in tandem with Bitcoin while exhibiting higher beta characteristics. Traders frequently use Ethereum futures for directional bets on the altcoin market’s overall health. Total Ethereum Liquidations: $120 million Short Position Percentage: 89.48% ($107.38M) Long Position Percentage: 10.52% ($12.62M) Primary Exchanges: Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Deribit The concentration of liquidations across specific price levels reveals important market structure information. Order book data indicates that liquidation clusters occurred near key technical resistance levels that many traders expected to hold. When these levels broke, stop-loss orders and forced liquidations created a vacuum of selling pressure that accelerated the upward move. This pattern demonstrates how derivatives markets can influence spot prices during periods of high leverage utilization. Bitcoin’s $108 Million Liquidation Event Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, witnessed $108 million in crypto futures liquidations during the same 24-hour window. Short positions comprised 83.95% of this total, representing approximately $90.67 million against $17.33 million in long liquidations. While Bitcoin’s percentage of short liquidations was slightly lower than Ethereum’s, the absolute dollar amount remained substantial due to Bitcoin’s larger market size. This event underscores Bitcoin’s continued dominance in derivatives trading volume despite growing altcoin markets. Bitcoin’s liquidation patterns often differ from altcoins due to its unique market characteristics. Institutional participation in Bitcoin derivatives has grown significantly in recent years through regulated products like CME Bitcoin futures. However, the majority of high-leverage trading still occurs on offshore exchanges. The recent liquidations primarily affected these offshore markets, where leverage limits often exceed 100x. Market structure analysis reveals that Bitcoin liquidations frequently cluster around round-number psychological price levels, such as $60,000 or $70,000 thresholds. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Liquidation Comparison Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Total Liquidations $108 million $120 million Short Percentage 83.95% 89.48% Short Value $90.67M $107.38M Long Value $17.33M $12.62M Market Cap Rank #1 #2 The timing of Bitcoin’s liquidations relative to Ethereum’s provides insights into market leadership dynamics. In traditional cryptocurrency market cycles, Bitcoin typically leads price movements with altcoins following. However, in this particular event, Ethereum’s liquidations slightly led Bitcoin’s in both timing and intensity. This pattern suggests evolving market relationships where major altcoins increasingly influence broader sentiment rather than simply reacting to Bitcoin movements. Solana’s $21.95 Million Liquidation Surge Solana experienced $21.95 million in crypto futures liquidations, with short positions representing a staggering 91.05% of the total. This percentage translates to approximately $19.98 million in short liquidations versus just $1.97 million in long liquidations. Solana’s exceptionally high short liquidation percentage reflects its status as a higher-volatility asset that attracts substantial speculative trading. The network’s rapid growth and technical innovations have made it a favorite among derivatives traders seeking amplified returns. Several unique factors contributed to Solana’s disproportionate short liquidation percentage. First, Solana’s derivatives markets have grown exponentially alongside its spot market expansion. Second, the asset’s historical volatility exceeds both Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating more frequent liquidation events. Third, Solana’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets varies more significantly than established assets, creating additional basis risk that can surprise leveraged traders. Finally, Solana’s smaller market capitalization means individual large positions can disproportionately impact prices and trigger cascading liquidations. Market Impact and Recovery Patterns The immediate market impact of these crypto futures liquidations included increased volatility and temporary price dislocations across affected assets. However, markets typically absorb liquidation events within hours or days as liquidity returns and equilibrium reestablishes. Historical analysis shows that post-liquidation periods often feature reduced leverage in the system as risk-averse traders decrease positions. This deleveraging can create calmer trading conditions temporarily before leverage gradually rebuilds. The funding rates on perpetual contracts typically normalize after such events, though they may remain elevated if directional sentiment persists strongly. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis The $250 million crypto futures liquidations event, while substantial, represents a moderate-sized liquidation wave compared to historical extremes. During previous market cycles, single-day liquidation totals have exceeded $1 billion multiple times. For instance, the May 2021 market correction triggered approximately $8.6 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse precipitated over $1 billion in daily liquidations. These comparisons provide important perspective on the relative scale of market stress. Nevertheless, the recent event’s significance lies in its composition rather than absolute size. The extreme concentration in short liquidations—exceeding 83% across all major assets—indicates a market caught leaning heavily in one direction. Such lopsided positioning often precedes trend reversals or accelerated moves as crowded trades unwind. Market technicians refer to this as “contrarian indicator” conditions, where extreme sentiment readings suggest impending mean reversion. The cryptocurrency market’s history contains numerous examples of similar setups preceding substantial price movements. May 2021: $8.6 billion liquidations during China mining ban announcement November 2022: $1+ billion liquidations during FTX collapse March 2020: $1+ billion liquidations during COVID market crash June 2022: $800+ million liquidations during Celsius crisis The increasing sophistication of cryptocurrency derivatives markets has changed liquidation dynamics over time. Early markets featured simpler mechanisms with fewer safeguards, leading to more frequent and severe cascades. Modern exchanges implement circuit breakers, auto-deleveraging systems, and insurance funds to mitigate extreme events. However, as trading volumes and leverage availability have grown, the absolute dollar amounts at risk have increased correspondingly. This evolution represents the natural maturation of financial markets as they scale. Risk Management Implications for Traders The recent crypto futures liquidations event offers crucial lessons for risk management in leveraged trading. First, position sizing relative to account equity becomes paramount during volatile conditions. Traders using excessive leverage relative to their risk tolerance frequently become liquidation candidates during normal market fluctuations. Second, diversification across assets and position directions provides some protection against single-direction liquidation events. Third, monitoring funding rates and open interest can provide early warning signals of crowded positioning that might precede squeezes. Advanced traders employ several strategies to navigate high-leverage environments. These include using stop-loss orders judiciously (while recognizing they can exacerbate moves during illiquid periods), maintaining adequate margin buffers above exchange requirements, and avoiding maximum leverage even when available. Some institutional traders utilize options strategies to hedge leveraged futures positions, creating defined-risk exposures. The growing availability of cryptocurrency options markets has facilitated more sophisticated risk management approaches in recent years. Exchange Mechanisms and Safeguards Cryptocurrency exchanges employ various mechanisms to handle liquidations while maintaining market integrity. Most platforms use a mark price system that averages prices across major exchanges to prevent manipulation through isolated price spikes. When positions reach maintenance margin thresholds, exchanges typically attempt to close them through their order matching systems. If insufficient liquidity exists at reasonable prices, some exchanges trigger auto-deleveraging (ADL) systems that close opposing profitable positions to cover losses. More sophisticated platforms maintain insurance funds accumulated from liquidation fees to cover deficits without ADL. Regulatory Considerations and Market Evolution The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency derivatives continues evolving across jurisdictions. Some regions have implemented leverage limits for retail traders, while others prohibit derivatives entirely for non-accredited investors. These regulatory developments aim to protect consumers from the risks demonstrated by liquidation events. However, they also create fragmentation as traders migrate to less-regulated venues. The ongoing tension between innovation and protection represents a central challenge for policymakers worldwide. Market structure evolution will likely continue addressing liquidation risks through technological improvements. Decentralized derivatives protocols offer alternative approaches using automated market makers and on-chain liquidation mechanisms. While currently smaller than centralized exchange volumes, these decentralized platforms provide different risk profiles and transparency benefits. Their growth could eventually reduce systemic risks from concentrated liquidation events by distributing exposure across multiple venues and mechanisms. Conclusion The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event highlights the ongoing risks and dynamics of leveraged cryptocurrency trading. With short positions accounting for the overwhelming majority of losses across Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana markets, this episode demonstrates how crowded positioning can precipitate rapid reversals. These crypto futures liquidations serve as a reminder that derivatives markets both reflect and amplify underlying spot market movements. As cryptocurrency markets mature, understanding liquidation mechanics becomes increasingly important for all participants—from retail traders to institutional investors. While such events create short-term volatility, they also contribute to market efficiency by removing excessive leverage and resetting sentiment extremes. FAQs Q1: What causes crypto futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance requirement for their leveraged position. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent negative balances, often creating cascading effects when many traders hold similar positions. Q2: Why were short positions disproportionately affected in this event? Short positions faced massive liquidations because prices moved upward against traders betting on declines. This created a short squeeze where covering positions added buying pressure, forcing more liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. Q3: How do crypto futures liquidations impact spot prices? Liquidations can significantly impact spot prices through several mechanisms. Forced buying to cover short positions increases demand, while forced selling of long positions increases supply. These flows can create temporary price dislocations and increased volatility. Q4: What percentage of traders typically experience liquidations? Exact percentages vary by market conditions, but industry estimates suggest approximately 70-90% of retail leveraged traders eventually experience at least one liquidation event, highlighting the risks of trading with high leverage. Q5: How can traders avoid futures liquidations? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks through proper position sizing, maintaining adequate margin buffers, using stop-loss orders strategically, avoiding maximum available leverage, and monitoring market conditions for signs of crowded positioning.

After a tumultuous period, total market capitalization has surged back above $3 trillion. However, many investors are left wondering what the new year has in store for digital assets. Institutions Forecast Bullish Crypto Prices For 2026 According to a recent report by analysts at Bull Theory, the past year proved to be robust for traditional markets, particularly for metals, while cryptocurrencies fell short of expectations. Silver surged by 160%, and gold followed suit with a 66% increase. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) wrapped up 2025 down approximately 5%, despite several positive indicators, such as consistent purchasing by Strategy, strong inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and growing institutional interest.

Standard Chartered targets Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of 2026, and JPMorgan projects a price of $170,000. Meanwhile, Citi’s base case stands around $143,000, with a more aggressive bull case suggesting a potential rise to $189,000. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest envisions a long-term scenario where Bitcoin could hit $500,000, contingent on widespread institutional adoption. Tom Lee from Fundstrat anticipates Ethereum will trade between $7,000 and $9,000 by early 2026, fueled by the tokenization of real-world assets. New Regulations And Economic Optimism The analysts further highlighted that, unlike previous years, this cycle looks distinct in several key aspects. For one, crypto is no longer encumbered by operating within a legal gray area. New regulatory frameworks, particularly in the US, are poised to offer clearer guidelines, reducing uncertainty and facilitating easier access for institutional investors. The anticipated changes aim for simplified regulations that could enhance market structure while broadening institutional participation beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, several factors suggest that a sharp movement in the crypto markets could be on the horizon. The end of quantitative tightening on December 1, 2025, coupled with a growing GDP, signals a conducive environment for crypto.

Overall, as the new year begins, the crypto market finds itself in a position of underperformance rather than excess. This contrasting state often results in rapid repricings as gaps are closed in response to liquidity alignment. As a result, Bull Theory analysts believe that 2026 could very well be the year when these disparities start to correct, leading to a potentially bullish environment for cryptocurrencies.

Turkmenistan’s Crypto Legislation Now In Effect As reported by Associated Press, the Asian nation of Turkmenistan officially recognized mining and exchanging cryptocurrency as legal on Thursday. The move comes after President Serdar Berdymukhamedov signed a law back in November, which allowed crypto companies to obtain registration starting January 1st. Located in Central Asia, Turkmenistan was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union before gaining independence following the USSR’s dissolution in 1991. Today, the country is considered as one of the world’s most isolated, due to strict state control over media, internet access, and foreign business activity. Home to a population of over seven million, Turkmenistan’s economy is dependent on its natural gas reserves, which rank as the fifth largest in the world. China is its main customer at the moment, with a pipeline project aimed at supplying gas to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in the works. For a nation known for tight state control, the move to embrace crypto marks a notable shift. Though, while the country is now open to mining firms and exchanges, it still hasn’t legalized digital assets as a form of payment, currency, or security. Turkmenistan isn’t the only Central Asian nation to have made developments related to the digital asset sector recently. Uzbekistan, located north of Turkmenistan, signed on an initiative related to stablecoin payments in November, approving a regulatory sandbox launch for January 1st. Elsewhere in the region, Iran has taken an even bolder approach, offering to sell advanced weapons systems to foreign governments for crypto, according to a report from Financial Times. The nation is willing to exchange ballistic missiles, drones, and warships for digital assets in a bid to bypass western financial controls, per the report. Bitcoin Has Been Stuck In Consolidation Recently While nations move forward with crypto regulation, the market has been stuck in a phase of consolidation lately, with the Bitcoin price unable to settle on a direction. As the below chart shows, BTC has been ranging between $85,000 and $90,000 during the last couple of weeks. The market slowdown has naturally not been restricted to just Bitcoin; the altcoins have also faced stale price action. Ethereum, for example, has positive returns of over 2% in the past month, which are not too different from BTC’s small decline of 2%. Over the past day, Bitcoin has once again climbed toward the upper end of the range, with its price currently trading around $89,500. Considering the recent pattern, it’s possible that this recovery effort may also fizzle out, but it only remains to be seen how things will play out in the coming days.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto exchanges|crypto mining|Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan Crypto,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/elon-musks-grok-says-ripple-cto-david-schwartz-is-satoshi-bitcoin-creator-heres-why/,timestabloid,"A well-known figure in the XRP community has placed an old mystery back into focus through a direct exchange with Elon Musk’s AI model, Grok. Vet (@Vet_XO), a validator on the XRP Ledger, posted an image containing four individuals who have appeared in past speculation around Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity (anonymous Bitcoin creator). He then asked Grok to remove everyone who isn’t Satoshi from the image. hey @grok remove everyone who is not satoshi from this image. pic.twitter.com/9bvTHWE2dH — Vet (@Vet_X0) January 2, 2026 Grok’s Opinion on Satoshi’s Identity The image featured David Schwartz, a prominent figure in the crypto space who recently announced that he would step down from his role as Chief Technology Officer at Ripple. Alongside Schwartz, it featured Hal Finney, a pioneering cryptographer and the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It also showed Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer known for his significant contributions to the development of digital currency and smart contracts. It also featured the late cybersecurity expert Dan Kaminsky, who was a renowned white-hat hacker and a prominent figure in the field of network security. Grok replied with an edited image that removed three people, leaving only David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. For years, many in the crypto world have speculated that Schwartz is Satoshi , and Grok’s response has drawn renewed attention to these claims. Is Schwartz Really Satoshi? Vet rejected the outcome and challenged the reasoning behind it. He showed skepticism and pushed Grok to explain why it singled out Schwartz. Grok followed up with a clarification. The AI emphasized uncertainty and referenced existing narratives around Satoshi’s identity. Grok pointed to long-running speculation tied to Schwartz’s background . It referenced his early work in cryptography and distributed systems, including patents dating back to the late 1980s, as well as his role at Ripple. Grok also noted that Schwartz has publicly denied being Satoshi Nakamoto and has said he first learned about Bitcoin in 2011 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Schwartz Remains Part of the Theory David Schwartz remains part of Satoshi discussions largely due to public perception and the narratives circulating online. Community speculation often highlights high-profile crypto figures with leadership roles in major projects, and Schwartz fits that profile. His visibility on social media, participation in XRP Ledger development, and engagement with crypto debates give his name repeated exposure. Multiple notable figures have also directly and indirectly suggested that Schwartz is Nakamoto , and the speculation is unlikely to die soon.

The latest rejection came after reports emerged about several explosions felt across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, which were linked to potential strikes by the United States. The cause has not been confirmed yet, but US President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned Venezuela of ground strikes, and deployed a navy task force in the Caribbean. Additionally, the BBC reported that the Trump administration was aware of the explosions today, but there’s no official statement yet. The CNN added that several areas of the city were left without power after the explosions, and agency journalists said they could hear the sound of an aircraft. Although the strikes have not been confirmed to be initiated by the US, BTC’s price felt the consequences immediately after the reports started to go live. The asset, which has been prone to experience enhanced volatility in times of attacks between different nations, stood at around $90,500 after it touched $91,000 yesterday.

About 40% of the top 100 Bitcoin treasury firms are valued by the market at less than the net asset value of their BTC holdings, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. At least 37 companies in the group now trade at discounts to NAV, a notable reversal from conditions seen in Q2 and Q3 2025 when the king coin was changing hands at all-time-high levels. During the first three quarters of the year, most treasury firms possessed sizable premiums and could issue equity above the value of their Bitcoin, raise capital, and buy more coins without immediate shareholder dilution. Nearly 200 public firms now hold more than 1 million Bitcoin collectively, valued at roughly $96 billion in 2026. Among the top 5 BTC DATs by holdings are Strategy , with 672,497 BTC, and MARA Holdings, which owns 53,250 coins. Twenty One Capital holds 43,514 Bitcoin, Metaplanet controls 35,102, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury holds 30,021. Is the Bitcoin DAT model a failure? mNAVs fall steeply When Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) began buying Bitcoin through convertible notes and equity, Bitcoin’s price was slightly above $11,000. Fast forward to 5 years later, an all-time-high value of $126,000 in October must have been a reason for MSTR shareholders to smile, but that wasn’t entirely the case. The model began to falter as equity valuations slipped and BTC prices tanked by over 30% in just three months, not to mention several firms like Strategy had bought the highs. Once stock prices fell below NAV, the business model of issuing new shares to buy Bitcoin became uneconomical, exposing firms to market pressure and investor criticism. A December report from BitcoinTreasuries.net showed that only one BTC treasury company, France-based The Blockchain Group, outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025, since the benchmark US stocks index returned 16% over the year. Every other treasury company was well behind the index, and about 60% of them spent more acquiring BTC than those holdings are currently worth. Pioneers Strategy traded at more than double the value of its Bitcoin last year, but its shares are now at a 17% discount to NAV. Smaller players like Sweden’s H100 Group trade at a 32% discount, Vanadi Coffee trades at a 61% discount to its BTC value, alongside five to six firms near parity, including Brazil-based OranjeBTC. Any modest equity selloff could push them below NAV and make them ripe for a takeover if Bitcoin’s price drop continues. Echoes of distress, delisting on MSCI, and DATs dubbed rug pulls Bitcoin treasuries are being blasted by some naysayers in the crypto community, who believe the companies’ buying spree led to a crypto market pull-down causality. “Every single one of these companies is simply a pump N dump rug pull on their common shareholders. And no, preferred equities won’t save your shitty scheme when you don’t have a profitable underlying business, will not save your shitty stock. You should avoid any company that calls itself a ‘DAT’ or ‘Bitcoin treasury company’. Bunch of scammers and idiots tbh,” complained one user on X. Some companies, seeing the whiplash of red mNAVs, are also stepping back, including Prenetics, a health-sciences firm that began buying Bitcoin in 2025. Cryptopolitan reported that it stopped adding coins on December 4 and will now focus on IM8, a nutritional supplement brand co-founded by former England football captain David Beckham. “We are making disciplined strategic decisions that reflect our experience as operators and our commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value,” Danny Yeung, Prenetics’s chief executive officer, said in a press release. In other related news, index provider MSCI’s decision to exclude companies holding significant BTC reserves from its global benchmarks will be made on January 15. If the NYSE-listed company greenlights its exclusion, estimates from BTC for Corporations show the DATs would be forced to sell between $10 billion and $15 billion over a year. BTC for Corporations, a group advocating corporate Bitcoin adoption, held discussions with MSCI leadership before 2025 came to a close. “We had a very constructive conversation,” said George Mekhail, the group’s executive director.

Despite record FY2025 revenue of $766M and positive operating income of $319M, CLSK's free cash flow remained deeply negative at -$461M, driving continued dilution and increased debt. Management turnover and a $1.15B convertible bond raise signal strategic urgency, with initial data center conversions targeting Sandersville and Texas facilities (200MW each). Full conversion of 1.4GW capacity could yield $1.4B–$2.1B annual revenue, but immediate, complete transition is not the current outlook. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner in transition to using its power capacity for AI data centers. It's a late shift and change of tone from previous guidance, and it's one worth a follow-up. While I think this will be a better business over time than BTC mining, tight cash flows and capital needs make the current valuation unfavorable. Summary of Previous Thesis When I wrote about CleanSpark in March, I was cautious about its status as a BTC mining pure play. This was something that made the company stand out, as other BTC miners were converting many of their assets into data centers. The move, broadly accepted across the BTC mining industry, leverages electrical capacity for an end use that can produce reliable free cash flow. CleanSpark's decision to stay out of it was, therefore, a curious one. Screenshot from previous thesis (Author's display of 10K data) Seen above, their BTC mining business was a cash burner, regularly requiring more shares to be issued, in order to finance operations. CleanSpark was betting that competitors' shift to data centers would make their mining operations more competitive, as it would give them a greater share of the global hash rate and therefore improve their BTC output. Nevertheless, BTC still needed to appreciate considerably to turn cash flows positive. Lacking those in the meantime and threatened by continual dilution that would kill off realized upside, I gave CLSK a cautious Hold rating. Updates and Subsequent Events In the months that followed, CleanSpark proceeded with the BTC mining pure play approach. They expressed growing confidence that the business would become self-sufficient, announcing a financing deal with Coinbase ( COIN ) in April. They stated that a portion of BTC mined would be used to sustain operations. Later, they touted reaching 50 exahashes per second in their mining. CEO Zach Bradford stated: As we look to the future, CleanSpark has laid the foundation to achieve 60 EH/s and beyond. This expansion capacity aligns with the Company's broader strategy to grow with capital efficiency only possible for an operator that has achieved escape velocity . ""Escape velocity"" was a term used in both cases, expressing that CleanSpark was near to achieving what I was afraid they would not achieve: an end to cash burn and shareholder dilution. Cash Flow Statements (Q2 & Q3 Fiscal 2025 Forms 10Q) In spite of this, there was still a total cash burn of $234M in fiscal Q3, after accounting for operating cash flow, purchase/disposition of miners, BTC proceeds, and purchase of fixed assets. If Bradford believed CleanSpark was reaching escape velocity, the numbers were not yet bearing it out. Whether he was right or wrong, Bradford resigned as CEO shortly after fiscal Q3 results were released. He was replaced by Matt Schultz, Bradford's fellow co-founder and predecessor as CEO (from 2014 to 2019). In early September, new management announced a strategic pivot to data centers. CleanSpark was finally on the AI-hyperscaler train. Stepping outside of self-funding operations, CleanSpark began raising capital again, such as a recent $1.15B convertible bond offering in November . End of Fiscal 2025 Financials Fiscal 2025 was, in large part, a record year for the company, with revenue reaching an all-time high of $766M. This also supported operating income finally turning positive, reaching $319M. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) For many folks this is a welcome sign, but the cash flow situation reveals some underlying cracks, coming out of the year. Cash Flow Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) While cash burn was lessened somewhat by reduced capex on miners and liquidation of BTC, operating cash flow still decreased overall for the year, reaching -$461M. BTC 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) Some likely recall the recent decline of the price of BTC in the fall. For CleanSpark, the fiscal year ended before this drop. They were mining BTC at prices above $100K for a large portion of the year. Fiscal 2025 Form 10K In order to raise capital and plug the gap, CleanSpark shares outstanding, basic and diluted, have both grown in the year, so the consequences of dilution persisted. Liabilities (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) They ended the year with significantly more debt, largely from the credit facilities they started throughout the year. Then there are the convertible bonds issued later that I mentioned earlier. Overall, it's a somewhat improved picture but still a company with serious capital needs. Outlook and Valuation CLSK trades for about $10 per share and a market cap of $2.6B. As free cash flow has been negative, the task is to determine how following the shift to data centers can tip the scales into positive cash flow. Much of what I will say next will work with very general estimates, given the lack of specifics at this stage. To start, I've looked at similar deals by other companies to give us an idea of what rates they could make with their electrical capacity: Applied Digital's ( APLD ) contract with a hyperscaler Another deal between APLD and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) Ionic Digital's contract with Nscale These contracts show that a data center can make about $1M to $1.5M per MW each year. I've included a table for your convenience. Author's display of data center revenue estimates Total electrical capacity was reported to be 1.4 GW in November. If we assume their total portfolio of capacity were used for data centers today, one could imagine revenue of $1.4B to $2.1B annually, dependent on the rates of local markets and the like. Of course, that assumes complete and immediate conversion of these assets, which isn't the outlook. During the Q4 earnings call , management largely highlighted the Sandersville and Texas facilities as the first places that could be converted to AI/HPC uses. Q4 Fiscal 2025 Investor Presentation These two sites are reported to have about 200 MW of capacity each that could be active by 2027. They could contribute about $400M to $600M in revenue. As the business currently has gross margins of about 55% just on its BTC mining, the underlying assumption is that the average margin for AI/HPC would be meaningfully superior to this. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) The devil is going to be in the details, but a look at key expense items currently show that these assets could produce an additional $100M to $200M in operating income. The upfront capex, however, means that free cash flow would likely not turn positive for some time, however. Liquid Assets (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) As CleanSpark ended fiscal 2025 with only $43M in cash and is slow to liquidate its $967M BTC holdings, this is why they had to do the $1.15B convertible bond offering in November and have leaned into their BTC-backed credit facilities instead. The cash from the convertibles should be sufficient to cover capex needs for the next couple of years (if recent years are a guide). Additional cash burn from operating expenses will force them to raise more capital at some point, and this will likely entail some kind of a dilutive offering. When I see a market cap of $2.6B, I think the fundamentals should practically produce a cash flow multiple of about 10 within a few years. The timing of things makes it seem unlikely they will hit such a milestone in a few years without diluting more. The guidance in the call, after all, was: Our focus is on building a capital stack, which minimizes dilution . Management realizes what I realize and can only promise to dilute as little as possible. I think CLSK needs to be more conservatively valued for it to reflect a real shot at undervaluation. A market cap of $1.5B, which would make an entry price of $5.80 or less, is one that seems to allow for a slower realization of positive cash flow and likely some kind of margin of safety. That isn't to say that a very patient investor couldn't see upside on CLSK at the current valuation, but we're likely thinking very far into the future and imagining that execution goes very well for the most part. Fiscal Q1 results, as well as monthly updates of power capacity, will be important in assessing just how large the pipeline is and how much higher-margin revenue could be realized that isn't on the table right now. Conclusion CleanSpark likely made a pivot that needed to be made, even before BTC prices declined. Nevertheless, strategic transitions take time and cost money. CLSK meanwhile is valued in the billions, when generating cash in the hundreds of millions without more dilution remains an open question. Investors can simply wait for a more reasonably priced entry, and for that reason, I maintain my previous Hold rating.",CLSK,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

56762333,652046,1767429053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56762333.jpeg,Crypto Could Become Iran’s Secret Weapon In Global Arms Trade,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-could-become-irans-secret-weapon-in-global-arms-trade/,bitcoinist,"Reports have disclosed that Iran’s state arms export arm, the Ministry of Defence Export Center (Mindex), is openly offering to accept cryptocurrency as payment for military hardware. According to the Financial Times and follow-up coverage , the listings on Mindex’s export platform include items ranging from drones and air defense systems to warships and ballistic missiles. The move was reported in January 2026 and marks a clear change from past, quieter uses of digital assets. Accepting Crypto And Barter To Avoid Banking Limits Based on reports, Mindex has placed offers that mention cryptocurrency, Iranian rial, and barter as possible forms of payment. The listings encourage potential buyers to contact Iranian officials to negotiate contracts. Sanctions from the US, the UK and the EU have shut many conventional payment routes, and Iranian officials appear to be using multiple channels — crypto among them — to keep export deals moving. Listings Include Broad Array Of Hardware Mindex’s catalogue, as described by multiple outlets, lists equipment across a wide spectrum: small arms and ammunition, drones, missiles, air defense systems, and naval vessels. Reports say Mindex claims commercial ties with about 35 countries. That number helps show the scale Iran’s exporters say they serve, even while facing banking isolation. How Crypto Fits Into Iran’s Cash Flows According to authorities outside Iran , the country has used cryptocurrency before to move value around borders. US Treasury findings previously tied more than $100 million in crypto flows to Iranian oil-related activity that skirted sanctions. Observers warn that accepting crypto for arms could make tracking payments harder, depending on the coins and the custody arrangements used. Some analysts say public listings could attract buyers who already avoid SWIFT and traditional banking. Governments and sanctions experts have raised alarms. If deliveries happen after crypto payments are received, enforcement agencies will face fresh tracing challenges. The US has a record of sanctioning networks that used crypto to support Iranian programs, and officials have signaled they will monitor new tactics closely. Some countries may consider tighter rules on crypto services used in cross-border defense deals. Based on reports , the export agency presents the offers as open to negotiation and claims sanctions will not stop contracts from being fulfilled. What remains unclear is how many, if any, arms contracts will actually be completed using crypto. There are also unanswered questions about which cryptocurrencies would be accepted, how escrow and delivery would be handled, and what intermediaries might be involved.

56762520,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=888098,1767429950,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56762520.jpeg,"Crypto social activity jumps at start of 2026, Santiment reveals",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-starts-2026-impressive-social-chatter/,cryptopolitan,"Crypto sentiment among investors and social media participants started the new year on a positive note, according to a Santiment analyst. According to the analyst, any upside movement in the market will depend on retail investors staying level-headed. In a video published recently, Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan mentioned that for the market to see an upside, it needs retail investors to continue being a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, and a bit impatient. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators pointing to fear among market participants, the analysts pointed out that Santiment’s social media data among investors and market participants points the other way. Crypto kickstarts the new year with an impressive social chatter According to Quinlivan, the signs are very positive at the moment, noting that it was always a bit of a concern in the past years. He mentioned that in this case, it might just be a metric that shows that we are gradually coming back from the holidays. Quinlivan also added that he is not particularly worried about any FOMO, adding that it could also enter the market if Bitcoin surges to $92,000 quickly. Bitcoin is currently trading around $89,930 at the time of publication, up 1.77% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Quinlivan noted that a quick rise in Bitcoin’s price to reach this level will show the “true reaction from retailers.” “Are they starting to pour in money because they’re saying Bitcoin goes up? That would be bad,” he said. Retail euphoria in crypto markets has always pushed towards all-time highs or cycle peaks, and going by history, the market has dropped shortly after. In addition, analysts have previously argued that when the market excitement gets too intense, the crypto market has always moved in the opposite direction to what most people expect. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a metric that measures the overall crypto market sentiment, posted a “Fear” score of 29 in its Saturday update. The Index has been hovering around the “Fear” and “Extreme Fear” region since early November. Analysts predict a short-term rally for Bitcoin January has always been a historic month for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with average gains of 3.75% for BTC and 19.07% for ETH, according to data from CoinGlass. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan has reported that Bitcoin could face a difficult start to the new year after the premier asset gave back most of the gains it accrued in the past three months. The token dominated headlines in the early part of 2025, thanks to Donald Trump shining a light on it after taking back the White House. However, some analysts have added that they expect Bitcoin to undergo a rebound, even if the recovery will not last. Citi analyst Alex Saunders has mentioned that near-term support could come from the expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds, which will continue to provide better access to retail and institutional investors. He highlighted that the prediction assumes adoption will continue and ETF inflows would reach $15 billion, but noted that the level can only sustain the prices for a short while. Meanwhile, attention will remain on Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as another beacon for price movement. According to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the company’s enterprise-value-to-holdings ratio, which is above the 1.0 level, reassures the company that it would not consider selling its holdings during stress. “If this ratio stays above 1.0 and MicroStrategy can eventually avoid selling bitcoins, markets will likely be reassured, and the worst for bitcoin prices will likely be behind us,” Nikolaos said.

This data, captured on April 15, 2025, reveals a market in delicate balance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and regulatory developments affecting digital asset trading worldwide. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratio Analysis Perpetual futures represent one of cryptocurrency’s most innovative financial instruments, combining traditional futures mechanics with unique funding rate mechanisms. These derivatives maintain constant exposure without expiration dates, making their positioning data particularly valuable for sentiment analysis. The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio specifically measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions across exchanges. Market analysts consistently monitor this metric because it provides real-time insight into trader expectations and potential price direction biases. Exchange-specific data reveals subtle variations in trader behavior. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, reported a slight long bias at 50.02% long versus 49.98% short. Similarly, OKX showed marginally more bullish positioning at 50.07% long against 49.93% short. Bybit demonstrated the strongest long preference among the three platforms at 50.16% long compared to 49.84% short. These minor differences nevertheless indicate distinct trading community characteristics across platforms. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios (24-Hour Data) Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Overall Aggregate 49.85% 50.15% -0.30% (Slightly Bearish) Binance 50.02% 49.98% +0.04% (Neutral) OKX 50.07% 49.93% +0.14% (Slightly Bullish) Bybit 50.16% 49.84% +0.32% (Moderately Bullish) Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Dynamics Perpetual futures markets operate through sophisticated mechanisms that maintain contract prices close to underlying spot prices. The funding rate system automatically transfers payments between long and short position holders every eight hours, creating economic incentives for price convergence. When long positions dominate the market, funding rates typically turn positive, requiring longs to pay shorts. Conversely, excessive short positioning usually generates negative funding rates where shorts compensate longs. Current funding rates across major exchanges remain near neutral, reflecting the balanced positioning revealed in long-short ratio data. Several factors influence perpetual futures positioning beyond simple price expectations: Hedging Activity: Institutional traders often use perpetual futures to hedge spot Bitcoin holdings Leverage Preferences: Different exchanges offer varying maximum leverage levels affecting position sizing Geographic Distribution: Regional trading patterns create distinct positioning biases across platforms Market Making: Professional market makers maintain balanced books regardless of directional views Historical Context and Market Evolution Cryptocurrency derivatives markets have undergone substantial transformation since Bitcoin futures first launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the first regulated Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017, providing institutional investors with compliant exposure to cryptocurrency price movements. Subsequently, cryptocurrency-native exchanges developed perpetual futures products that gained tremendous popularity among retail and professional traders alike. Today, perpetual futures trading volume consistently exceeds spot trading volume across major cryptocurrency pairs, establishing derivatives as the dominant price discovery mechanism for digital assets. Historical long-short ratio data reveals distinct market phases. During the 2021 bull market, aggregate long positions frequently exceeded 60% across major exchanges, reflecting extreme bullish sentiment. Conversely, the 2022 bear market saw prolonged periods with short positions dominating above 55%. The current equilibrium around 50% represents a maturing market where participants exhibit more measured positioning. This development suggests increasing sophistication among cryptocurrency derivatives traders who now incorporate more nuanced risk management strategies. Exchange-Specific Positioning Analysis Each major cryptocurrency exchange maintains unique trader demographics and product features that influence perpetual futures positioning. Binance, as the global market leader, attracts the most diverse participant base including retail traders, institutions, and algorithmic trading firms. The platform’s near-perfect 50.02%/49.98% long-short split reflects this diversity, with opposing views effectively canceling each other out. Binance also offers the widest range of cryptocurrency perpetual futures products, allowing traders to express views across multiple digital assets beyond Bitcoin. OKX has historically maintained stronger retail trader participation in Asian markets, particularly throughout China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. The exchange’s 50.07%/49.93% ratio indicates slightly more bullish sentiment among this demographic, possibly reflecting regional economic conditions or local regulatory developments. OKX also pioneered several innovative derivatives features including unified margin accounts and portfolio margin systems that influence position management approaches. Bybit demonstrates the most pronounced long bias at 50.16%/49.84%, suggesting its user base maintains moderately optimistic Bitcoin price expectations. The exchange has cultivated strong popularity among retail derivatives traders through user-friendly interfaces, competitive fee structures, and extensive educational resources. Bybit’s consistent long bias throughout 2024 and early 2025 aligns with its marketing positioning as a platform for bullish cryptocurrency traders seeking leveraged exposure. Implications for Bitcoin Price Action Balanced perpetual futures positioning typically correlates with reduced short-term volatility as opposing forces create market stability. When extreme long or short positioning develops, markets become vulnerable to liquidation cascades where rapidly moving prices trigger automatic position closures. These liquidation events often accelerate price movements in the dominant direction, creating volatility spikes. The current equilibrium suggests reduced near-term liquidation risk, potentially supporting more orderly price discovery processes. Market structure analysis reveals additional insights when combining long-short ratio data with other metrics. Open interest, representing the total value of outstanding perpetual futures contracts, has remained stable throughout the reporting period. Funding rates across all three exchanges hover near 0.01% per eight-hour period, indicating neither longs nor shorts face significant carrying costs. Combined, these signals suggest a market in technical equilibrium where neither bulls nor bears possess clear advantage. Methodological Considerations in Ratio Calculation Long-short ratio calculations employ different methodologies across data providers, creating potential interpretation challenges. Some platforms calculate ratios based on position count, while others use position value or trader count. The data presented here utilizes position value methodology, measuring the notional value of long versus short positions. This approach provides the most accurate representation of capital allocation and market exposure. Several important limitations affect long-short ratio interpretation: Hidden Positions: Some institutional traders utilize multiple accounts or platforms obscuring true exposure Cross-Exchange Hedging: Sophisticated traders maintain offsetting positions across different venues Market Maker Activity: Liquidity providers typically maintain market-neutral books regardless of personal views Timeframe Discrepancies: Ratios represent snapshots rather than continuous measurements Despite these limitations, perpetual futures long-short ratios remain among the most widely monitored cryptocurrency market indicators. Trading platforms, analysts, and media outlets consistently reference this data when assessing market sentiment and potential price direction. The metric’s popularity stems from its simplicity, transparency, and real-time availability across multiple data providers. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio reveals a cryptocurrency derivatives market in remarkable equilibrium during the latest reporting period. With aggregate positioning nearly perfectly balanced at 49.85% long versus 50.15% short, traders appear divided on Bitcoin’s immediate direction despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Exchange-specific variations show subtle differences, with Bybit maintaining the strongest long bias at 50.16% while Binance exhibits near-perfect balance at 50.02% long. This balanced BTC perpetual futures positioning suggests reduced near-term volatility risk as opposing market forces create stability. Market participants will continue monitoring these ratios alongside funding rates and open interest for signals of developing directional biases in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio measure? The ratio measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specified exchanges. It provides insight into trader sentiment and potential price direction biases within derivatives markets. Q2: Why do long-short ratios differ across cryptocurrency exchanges? Ratios vary due to differences in trader demographics, geographic distribution, leverage offerings, and product features across platforms. Each exchange attracts distinct user bases with varying risk appetites and trading strategies. Q3: How does the long-short ratio relate to Bitcoin’s spot price movements? While not perfectly predictive, extreme positioning (above 55% either direction) often precedes increased volatility as liquidation cascades can accelerate price movements. Balanced ratios typically correlate with more stable price action. Q4: What time period does the long-short ratio data cover? The data represents a snapshot of open positions at a specific moment, typically updated continuously throughout trading sessions. The analysis above covers positions active during a 24-hour period ending at the reporting time. Q5: How should traders use long-short ratio information in their strategies? Sophisticated traders incorporate ratio data as one component of broader market analysis, combining it with funding rates, open interest, volume patterns, and technical indicators to assess market conditions and potential turning points.

Amid the cheers of the new year, the flagship cryptocurrency has once again retested the proven price resistance around $90,500, but the market still bears a sense of uncertainty. Related Reading: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner? Bitcoin Coinbase Premium To Rebound? In an X post on January 2, renowned analyst Burak Kesmeci shares an insightful analysis of the Bitcoin market following the asset’s positive start to 2026. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has gained by almost 4% since the new year commenced two days ago. Amid the mild market euphoria, Kesmeci highlights a simultaneous rise in Coinbase premiums across the Bitcoin and Ethereum market suggesting the recent price gains are significantly influenced by US investors. For context, the Coinbase premium assesses how much more or less US investors are paying for an asset. It is a strong market indicator as US investors’ liquidity tends to heavily influence the global market. Despite the latest price gains, Kesmeci notes that Coinbase premiums for BTC and ETH still remain negative, suggesting the majority of US investors still remain cautious. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Bitcoin Short-Term And Long-Term Triggers In predicting future price movements, Burak Kesmeci has also outlined some potential developments investors should watch out for. Using the simple moving average indicator, the market expert has identified certain price levels of importance to Bitcoin’s price trajectory. For a bullish trend to kick off in the short-term, Kesmeci explains that Bitcoin must maintain its current 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) above the present level at $89,415 for at least the next two days. Notably, a potential loss of this price level would suggest the present consolidation continues. Meanwhile, the seasoned analyst also expects a positive long-term trend to only develop when Bitcoin crosses above $101,000, which represents an intersection between the SMA365 and SMA111. This outlook underscores $101,000 as a major psychological and structural resistance, with a decisive break above it likely to restore Bitcoin’s bullish market structure after the extended correction observed in Q4 2025. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $89,520 following a 0.85% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 11471%, representing buoyant market activity. Notably, Bitcoin’s market cap has climbed to $1.79 trillion, allowing the maiden cryptocurrency account for 58.6% of the total crypto market cap.

The surge in bearish bets shows traders are bracing for losses after a fast jump in the stock that followed a $6 billion deal tied to energy and artificial intelligence. Shares of Trump Media climbed more than 30% after December 18, when the company said it would merge with Google-backed TAE Technologies in an all-stock transaction. The stock ran even harder right after the news, jumping as much as 63% over two trading days. Since Cryptopolitan reported the announcement, short interest has jumped 31% to nearly 16 million shares, close to the highest level seen since October. After the stock rose another 4% on Friday to $13.77, those short positions were worth about $218 million in bets that the price would fall, according to data from Yahoo Finance. Short sellers stack bets after merger sends Trump Media shares higher Trump Media is still losing money, and its shares are down almost 60% over the past 12 months even after the recent pop. Right now, President Donald Trump owns 115 million shares, about 40% of the company, but after the merger closes, his stake would drop to roughly 20%. Short interest near 16 million shares puts bearish positioning near levels last seen in October. The build came as the stock stayed volatile following the announcement. With the price still well below where it traded a year ago, some investors are betting the recent gains will not hold as the market absorbs the scale of the deal and the company’s ongoing losses. Trump Media’s token plan increases exposure as America goes pro-crypto At the same time, Trump Media said earlier this week it plans to issue a new token to shareholders, giving one token for each share held through a partnership with Crypto.com, and the token will operate on the Cronos blockchain. Trump later said on Truth that the token holders could receive rewards tied to its products. Chief executive Devin Nunes called the rollout “a first-of-its-kind token distribution” that will “reward Trump Media shareholders, and promote honest and open markets.” Devin also serves at the White House as chair of the Intelligence Advisory Board, where he advises the president on intelligence matters. The company said the tokens would be issued “in the near future.” Founded in 2021, Trump Media has expanded its push into crypto while also moving into artificial intelligence and financial services. Despite that expansion, its shares have fallen more than 60% this year. The crypto plan adds to Trump-linked ventures that have already generated hundreds of millions of dollars and allegations of conflicts of interest from Democrats in Congress and even some Republicans. Since returning to the White House in January, Donald has backed looser rules for crypto trading platforms and related businesses. The industry spent millions during the 2024 election cycle, backing candidates including him. Over the summer, he signed the country’s first major national crypto law, a step that folded crypto deeper into the financial system. Still, investor appetite has cooled this year as traders pulled away from volatile bets. Bitcoin is on track for an annual loss after sliding from record highs set in October. Some Trump-linked bets have stumbled too. The TRUMP meme coin surged ahead of the January inauguration and quickly ranked among the most valuable tokens. Since then, it has lost more than 90% of its value.

BTC Price Prediction and Why Investors Are Turning to This New Crypto Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-bottom-in-btc-price-prediction-and-why-investors-are-turning-to-this-new-crypto-instead/,cryptopolitan,"Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be holding steady, forming a new bottom, but whether it is merely taking a breather before resuming a downtrend is a matter of debate among analysts. Against this backdrop, investors are beginning to weigh the merits of potential up-and-coming cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently in Presale Stage 7 at the price of $0.04, is expected to present potential returns of even up to 1000% to those who join the presale today. This new crypto is attracting attention duet to its utility. The project’s presale, coupled with a lending and borrowing platform, planned multichain expansion, and the availability of convenient means of buying MUTM tokens using credit cards, may ultimately facilitate a 10x growth. When compared to the current state of Bitcoin (BTC) whose potential is limited by the sheer size of its market cap, MUTM presents a scenario where early buyers may enjoy more rapid appreciation prospects. For investors searching for the next big opportunity, this crypto to buy now offers compelling early-stage potential. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck below $91K, although technical levels indicate budding break-out momentum. The charts are tightening, MACD just turned green, and prices have held all three short-term averages while testing above the mid-band of Bollinger Bands, suggesting a market that is range-bound and not crashing. Additionally, resistance at $85K appears steadfast, and a clean close above $91K would provide a strong break-out. Until then, BTC is range-bound, underlining that trading in established markets remains difficult and that large gains prove tough in mature markets. Meanwhile, breakout investment opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly taking over the market. Mutuum Finance Is Still Early at $0.04 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in a position that could be considered in an early valuation stage in its ongoing presale. Being priced at $0.04 with a projected launch price of $0.06, smart buyers are getting in prior to the public who are waiting for launch. The project has managed to raise more than $19.52 million in the first 7 stages of presale, where more than 18,650 investors have participated. The current pricing is being regarded as early, since MUTM will launch at $0.06. This means stage 7 buyers get to benefit from a near 2x rise by the time of launch. In addition, the platform’s features support the potential for at least another 20x rise after market debut. This puts MUTM among this cycle’s most anticipated DeFi launches. While Bitcoin’s rally is limited by its huge market cap, MUTM offers untapped growth potential and smart investors are recognizing this opportunity. Passive Income for Users One of the major aspects of Mutuum Finance is the mtToken model, which encourages users to lend their assets by offering them incentives. While conventional assets can only earn interest when withdrawn, the mtTokens offered by Mutuum Finance guarantee the investors the chance to earn profits instantly while still having liquidity at their disposal. This has made MUTM the top crypto to buy now and a must-hold in 2026. Halborn Security Audit & Testnet Launch One of the most recent developments for the project was to have their lending and borrowing contracts reviewed independently by Halborn Security. The audit suggestions have been incorporated, and preparations are underway for Mutuum Finance V1 to debut on the Sepolia testnet, which will mark the first time it goes public. Some features that will be included in the testnet are: Liquidity Pools for Lending & Borrowing mtTokens signifying deposits and accumulated yields of users Debt tokens representing borrowed positions Automated liquidator bot for the management of under-collateralized loans At first, the ETH and USDT tokens will be the main assets to lend, borrow, and use as collateral within the system. More assets will be included later, with MUTM set for multichain integration. The testnet enables users to engage with the system and provide feedback to optimize the system before the mainnet launch. As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates below $91K, offering little upside in an established market, the chance presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in its early stage, is an uncommon occurrence. At the price of $0.04 during Presale Phase 7, with only $2,500 in, 62,500 MUTM tokens can be acquired, which can grow after presale to as much as $62,500, considering MUTM fetches $1 per piece. That’s a 25x ROI without having to lift a finger. Already, more than 18,650 investors are on board, and the project has raked in $19.52M, along with an exemplary mtToken model set to churn out passive income, offering realistic utility alongside the possibility for explosive growth.

The total losses resulting from wallet drainer phishing attacks reached $83.85 million, affecting 106,106 victims worldwide. According to Scan Sniffer’s 2025 phishing report, there was an 83% drop in stolen funds and a 68% reduction in victims compared with 2024, when phishing scams drained nearly half a billion dollars from more than 330,000 users. The Web3 security group said the reduction was likely a result of the mixed bullish and bearish market cycles last year, where phishing activity went up at peak market performances and fell when user engagement on blockchain networks dropped. Crypto market valuation declines ‘sends away’ phishing scammers Per Scam Sniffer’s analysis and chart data tracking the first quarter, when markets were declining, losses stood at $21.94 million, affecting slightly over 22,000 victims. When markets began to recover in the second quarter, phishing losses declined to $17.78 million from about 21,000 victims. Phishing losses and victims by month. Source: Scam Sniffer. The third quarter was the most dangerous period for market participants because several assets had witnessed strong rallies, including Bitcoin, which peaked at $123,000, and Ethereum, which hit its all-time-high price at $4,946 in August. The price charge and bull market environment came with a surge in phishing activity, pushing losses to $31.04 million and impacting 40,000 victims. August and September alone accounted for 29% of total annual losses, making the quarter the most active for attackers. However, the last quarter of the year saw a pullback in phishing losses that fell to $13.09 million, by far the quietest part of 2025. Permit / Permit2 leads signature phishing theft methods The biggest single phishing theft last year resulted in a $6.5 million loss in September, where hackers made away with staked ether and wrapped bitcoin derivatives. The attackers used a method known as the Permit-style signature, a feat that made up 38% of losses among cases exceeding $1 million. Permit/Permit 2 signatures allow token spending approvals without direct transfers, which attackers take advantage of by disguising malicious permissions to appear as legitimate prompts and trick token holders into accepting them without question. Other cases included a $3.13 million theft of wrapped Bitcoin in May using an approval escalation technique, and a $3.05 million loss of stablecoins in August through a direct transfer exploit. Yet, only 11 cases exceeded $1 million in the year, down from 30 the year before. The data also showed a decline in the average loss per victim, which fell to $790, down from nearly $1,500 last year. While the report focused on signature-based wallet drainer attacks, one of the most unforgettable cases occurred in February, when the Lazarus Group compromised a developer machine through a multisignature wallet provider within the Bybit crypto exchange. A malicious code was injected into a signing interface, enabling attackers to spoof legitimate approvals and steal approximately $1.46 billion. Supply chain attacks were also among the most prevalent methods used, with attackers stealing developer credentials through phishing emails and injecting malicious code into open-source packages, backdooring hundreds of software libraries, and exfiltrating private information and security credentials. Other campaigns phishing hackers used included compromised front-end interfaces, hijacked social media accounts, and spreading malware to steal private keys and authentication data. 2025 closed with Google Task notification phishing abuse In other news, the year ended with a sophisticated email phishing campaign in December, as hackers targeted more than 3,000 organizations in manufacturing by abusing Google’s cloud-based infrastructure. Several users reported receiving emails that appeared as genuine task notifications, prompting recipients to complete an urgent “All Employees Task.” Victims who clicked buttons labeled “View task” or “Mark complete” were redirected to malicious pages hosted on trusted cloud storage services. Because the messages were sent using legitimate application integration tools, they passed all major email authentication checks and walked past security gateways undetected.

At the same time, a separate BTC USDT chart comparison circulating on X argues Bitcoin now trades in a consolidation zone that resembles the late 2021 structure before the next leg higher. Long term Bitcoin holders pause selling after months of distribution Long term Bitcoin holders appear to have eased selling pressure for the first time since July 2025, based on a CryptoQuant chart shared on X by Merlijn The Trader. The chart tracks a 30 day sum of long term holder supply change, alongside Bitcoin’s price and the long term holder supply line. After months of mostly red bars, the latest readings move closer to neutral, which signals less net distribution than earlier in the period. Long term holder supply change 30 day sum. Source: CryptoQuant,Merlijn The Trader The histogram shows two clear regimes across 2025. First, green bars dominated into late June and early July, which points to net growth in long term holder supply during that stretch. Then, the chart flips into persistent red bars from mid July onward, indicating sustained net reductions as older coins moved out of long term holder status, sold, or transferred. Meanwhile, the long term holder supply line trends lower through the second half of the year, matching the extended red phase. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price line swings through several peaks and pullbacks, including a sharp drop around late November. Even so, the selling signal in the long term holder metric looks to be fading near year end as the red bars shrink. That shift matters because long term holder behavior often acts as a supply side filter. When long term holders sell, they add inventory to the market and can cap rebounds. However, when they slow distribution, the market can absorb fewer coins from that cohort, so price becomes more sensitive to changes in demand from spot buyers and derivatives positioning. Still, this metric alone does not confirm direction, since macro moves, liquidity, and short term holder activity can override the signal in the near term. Bitcoin chart highlights late 2021 style consolidation A Bitcoin price chart shared on X compares the 2024–2026 BTC USDT structure with the 2020–2022 cycle, focusing on a sideways phase near a key horizontal level. The post came from Vivek Sen, who argued the setup supports a move toward $280,000. Bitcoin USDT cycle comparison chart 2024–2026 and 2020–2022. Source: Vivek Sen In the 2024–2026 panel, Bitcoin climbs, then trades in a tight range around the marked support line, with the chart labeling the consolidation area as November 2025. The earlier part of the move shows a downtrend break and recovery into the current range, which frames the market as holding above a reclaimed level rather than extending in a straight line. In the 2020–2022 panel, the chart marks a similar pause around November 2021 after an advance, followed by a strong continuation higher. The comparison implies the market can spend time building a base near prior resistance before the next leg. The chart also includes a dashed path projecting higher into 2026. However, it provides no timing signals or triggers beyond the idea that price needs to hold the highlighted zone. As a result, the takeaway is structural: Bitcoin sits in consolidation near support, and the bullish projection depends on that base staying intact while demand returns.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

According to reports, the attackers have been draining wallets years after encrypted vaults were stolen and laundering the digital assets through Russian exchanges. In 2022, LastPass confirmed that attackers had breached its systems by compromising a developer environment. The platform added that the criminals stole portions of the company’s source code and proprietary technical information. In another related incident, the hackers used the stolen credentials to breach the GoTo cloud storage firm, stealing LastPass database backups stored on the platform. For some users, the vault contained both stored credentials and cryptocurrency wallet private keys and seed phrases. Cryptocurrency theft attacks linked to LastPass breach During the breach, LastPass claimed that its vaults were encrypted. However, users with weak or reused master passwords were vulnerable to offline cracking, which TRM Labs believes has been ongoing since the breach occurred. “Depending on the length and complexity of your master password and iteration count setting, you may want to reset your master password,” warned LastPass when they disclosed the breach. The link between the LastPass breaches and the cryptocurrency thefts was also confirmed by the United States Secret Service last year after the agency seized more than $23 million in crypto and said the attackers had obtained the private keys of their victims by decrypting vault data stolen in a password manager breach. Court filings also mentioned that there was no evidence that the victims’ devices had been compromised through malware or phishing. In its report, TRM Labs connected the ongoing crypto theft to the abuse of the encrypted LastPass vaults stolen in 2022. Rather than the hackers moving swiftly to drain the entire wallets after the breach, the thefts have been carried out in waves, months or years after the incident occurred. It also shows that attackers have been gradually decrypting vaults and extracting stored credentials. In addition, the wallets were drained using similar transaction methods. TRM Labs also mentioned that the method used during the breach showed that the hackers possessed the private keys before the thefts. “The linkage in the report is not based on direct attribution to individual LastPass accounts, but on correlating downstream on-chain activity with the known impact pattern of the 2022 breach,” TRM said. The platform noted that it created a scenario in which the wallet occurs in the future, rather than immediately after the breach happened. TRM Labs highlights the use of Wasabi’s CoinJoin feature The platform also mentioned that its research was initially based on a small number of reports, including several submissions made to Chainabuse, where users identified the LastPass breach as the method the hackers used to steal their wallets. The researchers increased their investigation, identifying cryptocurrency transaction behavior across other cases, eventually linking it to the data theft campaign. TRM also added that it was able to trace funds even after the attackers mixed them using Wasabi wallet’s CoinJoin feature. CoinJoin is a Bitcoin privacy technique that includes all transactions from multiple users into a single transaction, making it harder to determine which input corresponds to which output. The feature obfuscates transactions without using a traditional mixing service. After draining wallets , the hackers usually convert stolen assets to Bitcoin, route them through Wasabi Wallet, and attempt to hide their tracks using the feature. However, TRM mentioned that it was able to demix the Bitcoin sent using the CoinJoin feature by analyzing behavioral characteristics, such as transaction structure, timing, and wallet configuration choices. It was also able to match deposits with withdrawal patterns that matched the crypto theft.

This comprehensive analysis examines BTC’s potential price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, incorporating historical patterns, technological developments, and macroeconomic factors that could influence the world’s premier cryptocurrency. Market analysts particularly focus on post-halving cycles and increasing mainstream integration. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Professional analysts employ multiple methodologies when forecasting Bitcoin’s future value. Quantitative models often reference stock-to-flow ratios, network effect metrics, and adoption curve projections. Historical data reveals Bitcoin has experienced four-year cycles typically aligned with halving events. The 2024 halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, creating predictable supply constraints. Furthermore, increasing institutional participation through spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced new capital flows. Traditional financial institutions now allocate portions of portfolios to digital assets. This institutional validation represents a significant shift from Bitcoin’s early years as a purely retail-driven asset. Technical and Fundamental Analysis Framework Analysts combine on-chain metrics with macroeconomic indicators for balanced predictions. Key metrics include: Network Hash Rate: Measures computational security and miner commitment Active Addresses: Indicates user adoption and network utility Exchange Reserves: Tracks available supply versus long-term holding patterns MVRV Ratio: Compares market value to realized value for valuation insights These indicators provide objective data points beyond speculative sentiment. The growing Lightning Network capacity additionally suggests improving scalability for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Post-Halving Momentum Analysis Historical patterns suggest 2026 could represent a period of consolidation or continued growth following the 2024 halving. Previous cycles indicate the second year post-halving often shows substantial price appreciation. However, analysts caution that past performance never guarantees future results. Several factors specifically influence 2026 projections: Factor Potential Impact Evidence Source Institutional ETF Flows Continued capital inflow SEC regulatory approvals Global Regulatory Clarity Reduced uncertainty premium MiCA implementation in EU Technological Scaling Improved utility and adoption Taproot adoption metrics Market observers note that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional assets has fluctuated. During periods of monetary policy uncertainty, Bitcoin sometimes behaves as a risk-off asset. This evolving relationship complicates straightforward predictions. Central bank digital currency developments may also influence Bitcoin’s perceived role in the global financial system. BTC 2030 Forecast: Long-Term Value Proposition Projecting to 2030 requires examining Bitcoin’s fundamental value drivers. The fixed supply of 21 million coins creates predictable scarcity. By 2030, approximately 98% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. This diminishing new supply coincides with potential increased demand scenarios. Several adoption trajectories could materialize: Store of Value Narrative: Continued adoption as digital gold Medium of Exchange Development: Improved scalability enabling transactions Institutional Infrastructure: Integration with traditional finance deepening Demographic trends favor increased cryptocurrency adoption. Younger generations show greater comfort with digital assets. Technological improvements in custody solutions and user interfaces could lower barriers to entry. However, regulatory developments across major economies will significantly influence adoption rates. International coordination efforts through organizations like the Financial Stability Board may establish clearer global standards. Expert Perspectives and Model Variations Financial institutions have published varied Bitcoin price predictions for 2030. These projections typically range from conservative to optimistic based on different adoption scenarios. Goldman Sachs analysts emphasize Bitcoin’s volatility but acknowledge its growing institutional acceptance. Meanwhile, Fidelity Investments researchers highlight Bitcoin’s unique characteristics as an uncorrelated asset. Academic institutions like MIT and Stanford regularly publish blockchain research that informs these forecasts. It’s crucial to understand that all long-term predictions involve significant uncertainty. Market participants should consider multiple scenarios rather than single price targets. Critical Market Factors Influencing Future Bitcoin Valuation Several interconnected elements will determine Bitcoin’s price trajectory through 2030. Monetary policy decisions by major central banks significantly impact all risk assets. Interest rate environments influence the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Geopolitical developments affecting currency stability may increase demand for decentralized alternatives. Technological advancements in competing blockchain networks could affect Bitcoin’s market dominance. Environmental concerns regarding energy consumption continue prompting innovation in mining sustainability. The transition toward renewable energy sources for mining operations may address these concerns. Additionally, security developments protecting against quantum computing threats remain an ongoing research priority for the Bitcoin development community. Comparative Asset Analysis Bitcoin increasingly competes with traditional stores of value. Gold maintains a market capitalization exceeding $13 trillion, while Bitcoin’s market capitalization fluctuates around $1 trillion. This comparison suggests substantial growth potential if Bitcoin captures even a portion of gold’s market. Real estate and bond markets offer alternative investment vehicles with different risk-return profiles. Bitcoin’s 24/7 market operation provides unique liquidity advantages over traditional assets with limited trading hours. However, this constant availability also contributes to volatility. The evolving regulatory treatment of Bitcoin as either a commodity or security will affect its investment characteristics and tax treatment across jurisdictions. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 involve analyzing complex technological, economic, and regulatory factors. While historical patterns and quantitative models provide frameworks, unexpected developments frequently disrupt financial markets. The Bitcoin price prediction landscape requires continuous monitoring of on-chain metrics, institutional adoption rates, and global macroeconomic conditions. Investors should maintain balanced perspectives, recognizing both Bitcoin’s transformative potential and its inherent volatility. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, Bitcoin’s role within global finance will likely continue evolving alongside technological advancements and regulatory developments. FAQs Q1: What is the most reliable method for Bitcoin price prediction? Analysts typically combine multiple methodologies including technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and fundamental factors. No single method proves completely reliable, so consensus among varied approaches provides the most balanced outlook. Q2: How does Bitcoin halving affect long-term price predictions? Halving events reduce new Bitcoin supply by 50% approximately every four years. Historical data shows these events have preceded substantial price increases, though each cycle exhibits unique characteristics influenced by broader market conditions. Q3: What percentage of institutional portfolios currently includes Bitcoin? Allocations remain small but growing. Recent surveys indicate between 1-5% of portfolio allocations among crypto-adopting institutions, with many traditional firms still in exploratory phases regarding digital asset integration. Q4: How do regulatory developments impact Bitcoin price predictions? Clear regulatory frameworks typically reduce uncertainty premiums and may increase institutional participation. However, restrictive regulations in major economies could limit adoption rates and affect price trajectories significantly. Q5: What technological developments could most influence Bitcoin’s price by 2030? Scalability solutions like the Lightning Network, improved privacy features, quantum-resistant cryptography, and enhanced smart contract capabilities through layers could substantially increase Bitcoin’s utility and adoption.

The Hong Kong tech company has already acquired various mining hardware from Bitmain to mine Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Its mining fleet comprises Antminer S21 XP Hydro units, S21 XP air-cooled miners, and Antminer L9 machines, which are expected to provide 30 PH/s for Bitcoin and 0.5 TH/s for Litecoin and Dogecoin. All installations are expected to be completed by the end of this month. It also secured 0.5 megawatts of power capacity across several US data centers . Not to mention, the firm is preparing to scale into broader digital assets activities, including future staking and node services, describing the start of its mining operation as a launchpad for its future services. BitVentures plans to expand crypto operations in the years to come BitVentures expects full mining deployment in the first quarter, targeting Bitcoin and select altcoins while prioritizing efficient, high-end machines to manage market fluctuations. Lawrence Wai Lok, CEO of the company, has described the rollout as a proof-of-concept phase, adding that the company will gradually expand its operations over time. He commented, “Subject to ongoing market conditions, the company intends to continue to invest in digital assets, and methodically scale its operations in tranches, creating a foundation for future expansion into broader digital asset services, including potential staking, node operations, and ecosystem partnerships.” He added, “We believe that establishing an efficient mining footprint may position the company favorably to pursue broader opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem.” Previously, BitVentures was formerly known as Santech Holdings and was listed on Nasdaq as STEC. The name change and ticker symbol change to BVC took effect on December 24. Before then, Santech’s core business had focused on technology investments, e-commerce platforms, and consumer-facing digital services, with no direct ties to blockchain or cryptocurrency. The firm had noted in its rebranding filing, “The company believes that the new name aligns well with its vision and focus on developing and investing in early-stage technology ventures.” Before switching to the Santech name, it was Hywin Wealth, a leading independent wealth management firm in China and a major player in real estate investment products. Over the past few months, several listed companies — including BitVentures — have turned to digital assets, raising crypto exposure as a potential remedy for business slowdowns and falling valuations. Last summer, biotech company 180 Life Sciences switched to an Ethereum treasury strategy after its shares had lost around 99% of their value. Corporations across all sectors, from non-bank lending to consumer products and agri-tech, have turned their attention to digital asset treasury strategies, such as those employed by Mill City Ventures, Upexi, and Nature’s Miracle. BitVentures shares surged 8% after it revealed its plans BitVentures’ stock has tumbled, with total returns since its IPO at approximately -89%, according to reports, a factor that may explain the company’s pivot. Stepping away from its wealth and asset management divisions resulted in the company generating no revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025. Nonetheless, BitVentures’ stock recorded a significant 8%+ increase in intraday trading after the firm announced its strategic move into the digital assets space, indicating a notable shift in its business strategy. The surge in share price came as investors increasingly bought into the company’s new bets in the cryptocurrency mining and broader blockchain-related services category — a portion of the tech industry that many investors see as high-growth, high-demand, and promising in the future.

Buyers continue to defend the $88,000–$88,500 zone, while momentum remains restrained. Technical structure points to compression, not weakness, with higher lows, stabilizing indicators, and cautious sentiment shaping the outlook. Whether Bitcoin breaks above $90,500 or revisits lower support will likely set the tone for its next major move. Why Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Is Continuing to Defy the Odds Recent price action points to a clear stalemate. December’s volatility may have grabbed headlines, but Bitcoin has since settled into a tighter range, forming higher lows while struggling to reclaim the upper $90,000s. #Bitcoin is starting 2026 at a crossroads. #BTC holds near $89.7K as buyers defend $88K support, volatility compresses, and RSI stabilizes. A break above $90.5K could unlock the next leg higher — or delay the move. pic.twitter.com/i4JltTfeYW — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) January 3, 2026 This price behavior reflects consolidation rather than weakness, at least based on current market data. After a turbulent December, profit-taking has cooled, while long-term holders appear comfortable maintaining exposure rather than rushing for the exit. Candlestick behavior supports this interpretation. Smaller candle bodies and shorter wicks suggest neither buyers nor sellers are pressing aggressively. There are no clear signs of bearish follow-through or panic-driven selling, reinforcing the view that the market is pausing rather than breaking down. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis: What’s the End Game? On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish after the breakout of remains a symmetrical triangle pattern which was defined by lower highs near $93,500 and a rising base between $85,800 and $87,000. This pattern typically signals compression and often precedes a volatility expansion rather than a sustained decline. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview So what is the current technical setup telling us? The constructive takeaway is that key indicators continue to lean supportive: Bitcoin is still printing higher lows along an ascending trendline drawn from mid-December, reinforcing underlying demand. The 50-day and 100-day EMAs are flattening and clustering around the $88,500–$89,000 area, creating a near-term support cushion. RSI has stabilized in the low-to-mid 60s, indicating improving momentum without entering overheated territory. There is no bearish divergence or negative EMA crossover in place, keeping downside risk contained for now. Market Data Adds to the Picture Looking beyond the charts, broader market metrics reinforce the technical setup. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization has rebounded toward $3 trillion, while 24-hour trading volume sits near $116 billion. That combination points to active participation without the kind of excess typically seen near market tops. Sentiment indicators also remain measured. The Fear and Greed Index continues to signal caution, reflecting lingering uncertainty rather than speculative euphoria, an environment that often leaves room for upside if price breaks key technical levels. What to Expect from Bitcoin in the Coming Weeks From a 2-hour chart perspective, a confirmed close above the $90,500–$90,900 zone would likely open the door to a push toward $93,500, with scope to extend into the $96,000–$97,000 area if momentum builds. Conversely, a failure to hold the upper $80,000s would weaken the structure and bring the $85,800 support level back into focus. At this stage, the price action looks more like preparation than exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin continues to defend the high $80,000s, the underlying bias remains constructive. A decisive breakout could shift sentiment quickly and potentially mark the start of the market’s next advance as the broader crypto cycle moves into a new phase. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

56765916,652135,1767434450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56765916.jpeg,Michael Saylor’s Strategy Anticipated To Disclose ‘Multibillion-Dollar’ Loss In Q4 Report,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-to-disclose-multibillion-dollar-loss/,bitcoinist,"Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is poised for one of its toughest year-end closings to date, as Bitcoin (BTC) prices have retraced below the $90,000 mark from highs exceeding $126,000. This downturn is expected to culminate in a multibillion-dollar loss when the firm releases its fourth-quarter financial results. Strategy’s Earnings Expected To Plunge According to reports from Bloomberg, Strategy is likely to announce substantial losses that represent a stark contrast to the $2.8 billion profit recorded in the previous third-quarter of the last year. Aaron Jacob, an associate professor at Brigham Young University and a senior adviser at Taxbit, noted the significance of this shift, stating, “There was this one-time pop, but that is a different story in this quarter. It is going to be a sizable loss.” The root of this anticipated loss can be traced back to an accounting change implemented in the first quarter of the year, requiring the company to value its cryptocurrency assets at current market prices. Given that Bitcoin tumbled 24% during the fourth quarter, the impact of this decision is now becoming evident. Following a period of strong performance against benchmark stock indices, the company’s shares have fallen nearly 48% throughout 2025, down to its current trading price of $156. Saylor’s Wealth Plummets 40% Concerns have also emerged that Strategy may need to sell portions of its Bitcoin holdings to cover mounting expenses, including dividends and interest payments. To mitigate these apprehensions, Strategy established a cash reserve on December 1 by selling common shares. Strategy also revised its full-year earnings guidance at the beginning of last month. The company is operating under the assumption that Bitcoin will range between $85,000 and $110,000 by year-end. Based on these projections, it anticipated operating income could range from a loss of $7 billion to a profit of $9.5 billion. However, with Bitcoin finishing the year down 6.5%, the likelihood leans toward a loss closer to the lower end of that spectrum. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the company’s co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylor , has also suffered a dramatic drop in personal wealth during this downturn, with his fortune falling by around 40% to approximately $3.8 billion. Market-To-Net Asset Value Drops To Critical Levels As if to compound the company’s challenges, Strategy now faces a potential decline in investor confidence. The enterprise value of the firm is nearing a level that could fall below the value of its Bitcoin holdings for the first time in over two years. Current data suggests the company’s enterprise value—including its debts and the total notional value of its perpetual preferred stock—stands at approximately $61 billion. With shares down nearly 70% from the record high reached in November 2024, the company’s market-to-net asset value (mNAV)—a ratio comparing market capitalization and debt to token holdings—has dropped to just above 1.

Bitfinex Hack Mastermind Receives Early Release On Friday, Ilya Lichtenstein, the mastermind behind the 2016 hack that stole over 120,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from crypto exchange Bitfinex, announced that he had been released from prison a year after receiving a five-year sentence . On X, Lichtenstein thanked a law signed by President Trump during his first administration for his release. “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early,” the post stated. Notably, Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act on December 21, 2018, aiming to improve criminal justice outcomes and reduce the size of the federal prison population. The law included a series of reforms, including one to establish a “risk and needs assessment system” that offers some inmates rehabilitative programming and the opportunity to be released early into home confinement. According to CNBC, A Trump administration official stated on January 2 that the mastermind behind the Bitfinex hack “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” The US Department of Justice (DOJ) previously declared that Lichtenstein used advanced hacking techniques and tools to access Bitfinex’s network. He then transferred 119,574 Bitcoin to one of his crypto wallets through more than 2,000 transactions. At the time, the stolen funds were valued at around $71 million. However, its value has increased exponentially in the past decade, being worth nearly $11 billion at current prices. During his sentencing hearing, he expressed remorse for using his talents on criminal activities “instead of a positive contribution to society.” “I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,” Lichtenstein affirmed on his Friday announcement, thanking his supporters for the help and vowing to prove “the haters” wrong. Crypto Heist Figures Reunite Under Trump’s Law Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, reacted to the news online, declaring that being reunited at home with her husband after four years was “the best New Year’s present” she could get. Morgan, a rapper known online as “Razzlekhan,” entered prison in February 2025 but was released early from prison after eight months under the First Step Act. In late October, she posted a video on X, sharing the news and thanking President Trump for her release. “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter,” she stated . However, it appears that the US President was not directly involved in the decision. As reported by Bitcoinist, the self-titled “Crocodile of Wall Street” was sentenced to 18 months in prison on November 18, 2024, for her role in the Bitfinex heist. Despite not being involved in the hack, Morgan assisted her husband in laundering the stolen funds by using “numerous sophisticated laundering techniques” to disguise them. Notably, they used fake identities to create online accounts, deposited the stolen Bitcoin in several darknet markets and crypto exchanges to withdraw the funds, converted BTC to other cryptocurrencies, and deposited part of the funds into crypto mixers. The couple seemingly managed to launder 21% of the total funds stolen from Bitfinex. At the time, prosecutors argued that Morgan was “a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions.” Nonetheless, they noted that she was “a lower-level participant,” which resulted in her reduced sentence.",Crypto News|2016 Bitfinex Hack|bitcoin|Bitcoin Heist|Bitfinex exchange|Bitfinex Hacker|btc|BTCUSDFT|crypto hacker|Crypto heist|heather Morgan|Ilya Lichtenstein|US President Donald Trump,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,0,0,EN,"{

This sudden downturn followed breaking news reports of a targeted U.S. military airstrike in Venezuela, immediately highlighting the digital asset’s ongoing sensitivity to real-world geopolitical shocks. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing whether this represents a fleeting reaction or the start of a deeper correction amidst a complex macroeconomic landscape. Bitcoin Price Reacts to Sudden Geopolitical Shock According to data from major exchanges and reported by Cointelegraph, the leading cryptocurrency reversed from an intraday high near $90,940. The sell-off accelerated rapidly as news wires confirmed the Venezuelan incident. Market depth charts showed significant short-term selling pressure materializing in the wake of the headlines. This event provides a stark, real-time case study in market microstructure. High-frequency traders and algorithmic systems often execute pre-programmed risk-off protocols during such events. Historically, Bitcoin and other crypto assets have demonstrated pronounced volatility during geopolitical crises. For instance, the initial phases of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict saw similar sharp declines followed by a vigorous recovery. The current situation mirrors that pattern, where initial fear-driven selling gives way to more nuanced trading based on the conflict’s perceived duration and global economic impact. Market participants are now closely monitoring official statements from Washington D.C. and Caracas for further clues. Analyst Consensus and Short-Term Market Pressure Many prominent market analysts believe the Bitcoin price drop will likely prove temporary, contingent on the situation not escalating into a broader regional conflict. “Geopolitical events often create knee-jerk liquidity crunches in digital asset markets,” noted a strategist from a major crypto investment firm. “The underlying network fundamentals for Bitcoin remain unchanged. However, if the situation stabilizes, we typically see a retracement of the initial panic move.” This perspective is supported by on-chain data, which showed no corresponding spike in long-term holder distribution during the sell-off. Evidence from Derivatives and On-Chain Metrics Data from derivatives markets offers further context. The funding rates for Bitcoin perpetual swaps turned slightly negative, indicating heightened caution among leveraged traders. Meanwhile, the futures open interest declined modestly, suggesting a unwind of speculative positions rather than a fundamental exodus. The following table summarizes key market metrics before and after the news broke: Metric Pre-News (Approx.) Post-News (Approx.) BTC Spot Price $90,940 $89,850 24h Trading Volume Change +15% +85% Fear & Greed Index Greed (72) Neutral (54) BTC Dominance 52.1% 51.8% This data illustrates a classic risk-off shift. The surge in volume confirms the news was the primary catalyst, while the shift in market sentiment indices reflects a sudden reassessment of risk. The Broader Context: Capital Rotation and Macro Trends The event occurs against a fascinating macroeconomic backdrop. Notably, gold—the traditional safe-haven asset—has been correcting after recently hitting a nominal all-time high. In contrast, Bitcoin had risen approximately 5% since the Christmas holiday period. This divergent performance has fueled analyst speculation about a potential capital rotation from traditional stores of value into digital assets. The theory suggests investors may be reallocating a portion of their inflation-hedge portfolios. Several factors support this observation. First, increasing institutional adoption provides a structural bid for Bitcoin. Second, its fixed supply schedule contrasts with the continuous mining of precious metals. Finally, its digital, borderless nature offers a unique value proposition in times of regional instability. However, today’s price action serves as a crucial reminder that Bitcoin’s journey to becoming a uncorrelated safe haven remains a work in progress. Its price discovery is still heavily influenced by global liquidity conditions and investor sentiment. Historical Precedents and Market Psychology Examining past reactions provides critical insight. During the 2020 U.S.-Iran tensions, Bitcoin initially sold off before rallying strongly in the subsequent weeks. The market often processes geopolitical risk in two phases: an initial liquidity shock where all risky assets are sold, followed by a reassessment phase where assets with strong underlying theses recover. The speed of Bitcoin’s recovery this time will be a key indicator of its maturity. Long-term holders, often called ‘HODLers,’ typically view these dips as accumulation opportunities, which can create a price floor. Conclusion The sudden drop in the Bitcoin price below $90,000 following the Venezuela airstrike news underscores the cryptocurrency market’s acute sensitivity to geopolitical developments. While analysts largely view the sell-off as a temporary reaction to a risk-off shock, it vividly illustrates the asset class’s current stage of evolution. The concurrent narrative of potential capital rotation from gold to BTC adds a complex, longer-term dimension to the short-term volatility. Ultimately, the market’s response in the coming days will offer valuable evidence on Bitcoin’s resilience and its evolving role within the global financial ecosystem during periods of international tension. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall after the Venezuela airstrike news? Financial markets often react negatively to sudden geopolitical instability due to increased uncertainty. The news triggered automated and discretionary selling as investors sought to reduce risk exposure, causing a short-term liquidity shock in the cryptocurrency market. Q2: How does this reaction compare to Bitcoin’s behavior in past geopolitical crises? The pattern is consistent with previous events, such as the early 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Typically, an initial sharp sell-off on the news is followed by a period of consolidation and often a recovery, depending on the scale and duration of the crisis. Q3: What is meant by ‘capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin’? This theory suggests that some investors are moving funds out of traditional safe-haven assets like gold, which has recently corrected from highs, and into Bitcoin. The 5% rise in BTC since Christmas amidst gold’s correction is cited as preliminary evidence, though long-term trends require more data. Q4: Will the Bitcoin price drop continue? Most analysts cited believe the drop will be temporary if the Venezuela situation does not escalate significantly. Market recovery will depend on the evolution of the geopolitical event, broader macroeconomic conditions, and underlying on-chain Bitcoin network strength. Q5: What metrics should investors watch now? Key metrics include the stability of the Venezuela situation, Bitcoin’s on-chain exchange flows (to see if long-term holders are selling), derivatives market funding rates, and the price action of traditional safe havens like gold and the U.S. dollar.

Venezuelan authorities accused Washington of hitting military-linked targets and announced emergency security measures after the blasts. U.S. President Donald Trump later said Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and flown out of the country following the operation. At the time of reporting, officials did not publish a detailed briefing that confirmed targets, timing, or the claim’s operational details. Airspace warnings and flight restrictions also surfaced in early coverage. As a result, traders treated the headlines as an immediate macro risk event, even while many facts remained unsettled. Bolivar Weakness and Dollar Pricing Fueled USDT Demand Venezuela entered the latest shock with a fragile currency setup. The Venezuelan bolívar has faced repeated depreciation pressure, while many merchants price goods in U.S. dollars to avoid fast-changing local costs. USD/VES Exchange Rate Trend. Source: Trading Economics That gap creates a daily conversion problem. People often earn or hold bolívars, yet they need dollars for rent, imports, and bigger purchases, so exchange rates matter even for routine spending. In that environment, USDT has expanded as a “digital dollar” substitute for transfers and short-term savings. When cash USD gets scarce or risky to move, USDT can act as a bridge between bolívars and dollar-based pricing, including for business payments. Bitcoin Price Mirrors Israel–Iran Headline Volatility Bitcoin traded in a wide intraday range on Jan. 3, and the chart shows sharp swings instead of a one-way move. Price fell toward $88,600 in the late afternoon, then it rebounded fast and pushed above $90,500 in the evening. After that spike, Bitcoin drifted lower in choppy trading, and it later dipped again near $89,400 before stabilizing around $89,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Intraday Price Chart (Jan. 3).

56766490,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258263,1767439211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-caroline-crenshaw-resigns-crypto/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a move that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a steadfast Democratic voice for stringent cryptocurrency oversight, has announced her resignation from the agency. Her departure, first reported by DL News, removes a pivotal figure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and sparks immediate analysis about the future direction of crypto policy. Crenshaw consistently championed a strict application of securities laws to the burgeoning industry, most notably dissenting against the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Consequently, her exit introduces significant uncertainty and potential for a more industry-friendly regulatory posture from the nation’s top financial markets watchdog. Caroline Crenshaw’s Legacy as an SEC Crypto Critic President Joe Biden appointed Caroline Crenshaw to the SEC in 2020. She quickly established herself as the commission’s most vocal skeptic regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. Her regulatory philosophy centered on robust investor protection and market integrity. Crenshaw frequently argued that many digital assets constitute securities under existing law. She believed they should therefore comply with the full suite of registration and disclosure requirements. This stance often placed her at odds with industry advocates seeking new, tailored frameworks. Her tenure featured several high-profile dissents and public statements. These documents now form a clear record of her cautious approach. For instance, she voiced deep concerns about the custody, valuation, and market manipulation risks inherent in crypto markets. Furthermore, Crenshaw emphasized the potential for retail investor harm in a volatile and complex asset class. Her consistent messaging provided a counterbalance to more permissive views, both within the SEC and in the broader political arena. A Defining Moment: The Bitcoin ETF Dissent Commissioner Crenshaw’s most significant public stand occurred in January 2024. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, approved a batch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This decision marked a historic pivot after years of rejections. However, Crenshaw issued a forceful and detailed dissent. She argued the approvals failed to adequately address fundamental concerns about fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin spot markets. Crenshaw warned that the decision could expose millions of investors to substantial risks. This dissent cemented her reputation as the commission’s foremost crypto critic and highlighted the deep internal divisions on the issue. The Immediate Impact of the Resignation on Crypto Regulation Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation creates an immediate vacancy on the five-member commission. The SEC’s current composition now leans more heavily toward perspectives that may be open to engaging with the digital asset sector. However, Chair Gary Gensler remains a central figure. His own enforcement-focused approach will continue to guide the agency’s day-to-day operations. The immediate impact may be more tonal than substantive in the short term. Nevertheless, her absence removes a powerful internal voice advocating for the strictest possible interpretation of the law. The resignation process triggers a political appointment sequence. President Biden will nominate a successor, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. This process offers a key opportunity to shift the commission’s balance. Industry groups will likely lobby for a nominee with a more nuanced understanding of blockchain technology. Conversely, investor protection advocates will push for someone who maintains Crenshaw’s vigilance. The timeline for this appointment remains uncertain, creating a period of regulatory ambiguity. Potential Shifts in Pending Enforcement and Rulemaking Analysts are scrutinizing several ongoing SEC initiatives for potential change. High-profile enforcement cases against major crypto exchanges, which Crenshaw likely supported, will probably continue. However, her departure could influence the commission’s appetite for future, expansive legal theories. In terms of rulemaking, key areas to watch include: Custody Rules: Proposed changes to how investment advisers custody digital assets. Exchange Definitions: Rules that could expand the definition of an “exchange” to include DeFi platforms. Staking Services: Regulatory clarity for crypto staking and lending products. Without Crenshaw’s vote, proposals in these areas might see modifications or face closer votes, potentially leading to more industry-favorable outcomes. Historical Context and the Broader Regulatory Battle Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation occurs during a pivotal decade for financial regulation. The rise of blockchain technology has challenged decades-old legal frameworks globally. In the United States, the debate centers on whether existing securities laws, largely written in the 1930s, can effectively govern this new asset class. The SEC, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, has generally argued they can. Crenshaw was a leading proponent of this view. Her stance contrasted with other regulators, like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has sought greater authority over digital commodities. This internal SEC dynamic mirrors a larger conflict in Washington. Legislative efforts to create a comprehensive crypto framework have repeatedly stalled in Congress. In the absence of new laws, regulatory agencies like the SEC have used enforcement actions to establish boundaries. Crenshaw’s voice was crucial in shaping that enforcement-first strategy. Her exit may encourage renewed legislative negotiations, as industry players see an opening for a more collaborative regulatory partner. Expert Analysis on the Commission’s Future Direction Financial law experts emphasize that one commissioner’s departure does not instantly reverse policy. “Commissioner Crenshaw was an important intellectual force for caution,” notes a former SEC senior counsel. “Her dissents provided a roadmap for legal challenges to SEC actions perceived as too lenient. Without that voice, the internal debate may lack a certain rigor, potentially allowing for more pragmatic, though still regulated, approaches to emerge.” Other analysts point to the remaining commissioners’ public statements. They suggest a continued focus on enforcement but perhaps with more publicly stated distinctions between different types of crypto assets. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the SEC and Crypto The resignation of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw marks the end of a definitive era in U.S. cryptocurrency regulation. Her unwavering advocacy for applying traditional securities laws with full force provided a clear, if contentious, regulatory stance. Her departure introduces a new variable into an already complex equation. While immediate, sweeping changes are unlikely, the long-term trajectory of SEC policy toward digital assets may now have greater flexibility. The focus now shifts to the White House and the Senate. The appointment of her successor will send the next clear signal about whether the SEC under Chair Gensler will maintain its hardline posture or begin a cautious pivot toward a more structured engagement with the crypto industry. The legacy of Caroline Crenshaw’s tenure will be measured by how that future unfolds. FAQs Q1: Why did Caroline Crenshaw resign from the SEC? Commissioner Crenshaw has not publicly stated a specific reason for her resignation. Such departures are common at the end of a term or for personal career progression. The announcement, reported by DL News, simply confirms her decision to leave the agency. Q2: Does her resignation mean the SEC will stop suing crypto companies? No. The SEC’s enforcement division operates independently and pursues cases it believes violate securities laws. Chair Gary Gensler, who leads the agency, remains in place and has consistently supported an active enforcement stance. Crenshaw’s departure may affect the commission’s vote on certain cases but is unlikely to halt enforcement altogether. Q3: Who will replace Caroline Crenshaw on the SEC? President Biden will nominate a successor. The nominee must then be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The process could take several months. The new commissioner will likely be a Democrat, maintaining the current 3-2 partisan split, but their specific views on cryptocurrency regulation will be closely watched. Q4: How did Crenshaw vote on the spot Bitcoin ETFs? Commissioner Crenshaw dissented against the January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. She published a detailed statement arguing that the approvals did not sufficiently protect investors from fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market. Q5: Will this make it easier for other crypto ETFs (like for Ethereum) to get approved? Potentially. Crenshaw was a noted skeptic of the entire asset class. Her absence removes one likely “no” vote from the commission. However, the approval of an Ethereum ETF or similar product would still depend on the applicant meeting the SEC’s stringent requirements and the views of the remaining four commissioners, including Chair Gensler.

The chart’s highest valuation band, ‘Maximum Bubble Territory’, spans roughly $334,173.88 to $449,435.85 and is historically associated with extreme overvaluation and late-cycle market euphoria. Just below it, the ‘Sell, Seriously, SELL!’ zone ranges from about $256,680.28 to $334,173.88, signaling conditions where long-term returns have historically weakened, and downside risk increased. The ‘FOMO intensifies’ band places Bitcoin between approximately $200,285.53 and $256,680.28, reflecting periods of accelerating retail participation and momentum-driven buying. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter Below that, the ‘Is this a bubble?’ level, running from around $157,214.21 to $200,285.53, points to elevated prices that often spark debate over sustainability without necessarily marking a market peak. The ‘HODL!’ zone, spanning roughly $120,036.03 to $157,214.21, represents valuations where long-term holders have historically been inclined to maintain positions amid strong but not excessive optimism. Further down, the ‘Still cheap’ band places the cryptocurrency between about $92,914.92 and $120,036.03, implying prices that in past cycles have offered favorable long-term risk-reward. The ‘Accumulate’ zone ranges from approximately $71,943.71 to $92,914.92 and reflects levels where investors have historically increased exposure during subdued sentiment. Below that, the ‘BUY!’ category spans roughly $53,350.41 to $71,943.71, a range associated with broad undervaluation in prior cycles. At the lowest end, the ‘Basically a Fire Sale’ zone places Bitcoin between about $40,828.60 and $53,350.41, representing deep-value territory that has historically aligned with strong long-term entry points after major drawdowns. Bitcoin’s possible Jan 31 price Taken together, the Rainbow Chart does not forecast a specific Bitcoin price for January 31, 2026, but outlines sentiment-based valuation bands that frame potential upside and downside scenarios. With Bitcoin currently trading at $89,777, the chart suggests a plausible path into late January 2026, within the ‘Still cheap’ or ‘HODL!’ zones, corresponding to roughly $93,000 to $157,000 if BTC continues to follow its historical growth curve.

The story was a little different for the digital asset market after the New Year’s holiday, with altcoins specifically enjoying the bulk of the rally. On Friday, January 2nd, the premier cryptocurrency jumped to above the psychological $90,000 level. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that there is no need for investors to be excited about the recent Bitcoin price action. Bitcoin Price Needs To Cross The STH Average Cost At $99,000 In a January 2nd post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that the recent price jump for Bitcoin does not say a lot about the current market structure. The on-chain data pundit’s evaluation is based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price, which currently lies around the $99,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K For context, the Short-Term Holder Realized Price is an on-chain metric that tracks the average price where Bitcoin short-term investors (holding for less than 115 days) acquired their coins. Being the average cost basis of the most reactive group of investors, the STH Realized Price often functions as a dynamic support and resistance level. While the price of BTC slipped beneath the Short-Term Holder Realized Price four times in the past year, it has been below this critical threshold since September 2025. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin price needs to close above this STH Realized Price at $99,000 before bull run conversations can resume. Kesmeci wrote on X: No bull market without the short-term investor with a broken heart being made happy. This statement reiterates the importance of short-term investors in market dynamics. For instance, in this case, breaking the Short-Term Holder Realized Price would suggest the return of demand and confidence among the most reactive investor cohort. Data Converges Between $99,000 And $102,000 Furthermore, Kesmeci pointed out that additional on-chain data reinforces the critical importance of the $99,000 region to the Bitcoin price trajectory. The crypto analyst said that significant data is converging in the $99,000 – $102,000 range, and until this region is surpassed, the price of BTC might continue to struggle. In an earlier post on the X platform, Kesmeci had revealed that the price of BTC needs to close above $101,000 for the long-term trend to turn positive. This explains why the analyst later concluded that the $99,000 – $102,000 bracket is pivotal to Bitcoin’s health. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $90,110, reflecting a roughly 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Many altcoins have performed a lot better on a daily scale, including some of the meme coin reps, such as DOGE and PEPE. BTC to Face More Volatility? After being one of the few global assets to end 2025 in the red , bitcoin’s price finally started to show some revival signs on January 2. Following a quiet January 1, in which it remained sideways between $87,000 and $88,000, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive yesterday and broke past $90,000 for the first time in about a week. This time, the bulls kept the pressure on and drove it even further north to a multi-week peak of $91,000. However, that was as far as BTC would go, at least for now, and it quickly retraced to $90,000. It added several hundred dollars late on Friday, but the explosions in Venezuela’s capital on Saturday morning halted its progress. Bitcoin dipped to $89,300 but now sits closer to $90,000 after US President Donald Trump confirmed that his country’s military was behind the strikes against Caracas. Moreover, he added that the US captured Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. A press conference is expected later today, which could result in more volatility in the crypto market, given that it’s the only financial market open today. For now, BTC’s market cap has neared $1.8 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is below 57% on CG. BTCUSD Jan 3.

PEPE is the other notable meme coin gainer, having surged by another 15% to $0.000006. Nevertheless, MYX has stolen the show with an 85% pump today to almost $7.

The timing of the incident has not fared well for Bitcoin, which slipped below $90,000 after trading above the price mark for the better part of Friday’s trading hours. As confirmed by CBS News, US troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and flew him outside the country in the company of his wife. Local news outlets reported that several explosions were heard around 1:50 AM local time on Saturday (12:50 AM Eastern Time). STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP pic.twitter.com/nHDqtsqRFh — Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) January 3, 2026 Trump wrote on Truth Social that “further details would follow,” and he would hold a press briefing at his Mar-a-Lago residence at 11 AM ET. The US also seized two Venezuelan oil tankers in recent weeks, launched strikes on more than 30 vessels allegedly carrying drugs, and hit “the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs.” Maduro denied all accusations of drug trafficking or collaboration with terrorist organizations. Venezuela’s president captured: What it means for crypto Just two hours after news about the Venezuelan air strikes broke, Bitcoin slipped downwards to $89,571, from nearly $91,000 the previous day. Several market analysts believe any form of war in the West, the purported “hotbed” for crypto adoption, is extremely bearish for digital assets just three days into the new year. “Oh, is Bitcoin back over 90K? It would be a real shame if someone… BOMBED VENEZUELA. Notice that all of the bullshit happens on Friday nights because Trump wants stock markets to have 48 hours to absorb the news,” Bitcoin investor Lark Davis surmised. According to market observer Ether Rawl, during Israel’s attack on Gaza in October 2023, Bitcoin dropped approximately 5% in the days following. He suggested the Venezuela strikes could push the king coin below the weekly 100 EMA, slightly under $86,000, and it is still unknown if a recovery will materialize. Trading group Money Ape sees the US-Venezuela tussle as a war on Bitcoin and crypto, and is adamant President Trump has chosen to take custody of Maduro now because “he is manipulating the market.” BREAKING: 🇺🇸 US is attacking Venezuela. And it's happening exactly when crypto is trying to recover. F*cking tired of this shit now. — Ash Crypto (@AshCrypto) January 3, 2026 The US dollar fell to around 98.2 on the first trading day of 2026, after counting a 9% annual loss in 2025. A fall in the greenback’s value would mean the crypto market is ready for a comeback under normal conditions, but with the war on Venezuela in play, Bitcoin bulls might not have enough in their tank to shake off end-2025’s bearish effects. “I am still long until 94k at least. The only problem I see is the war between Trump and Venezuela. If the conflict escalates, we’re going to have choppy price action,” economist Market Hokkage predicts. Political backlash from Liberals in the United States Before today’s events, congressional Democrats and some Republicans had attempted to limit Trump’s military options in Venezuela. They had been seeking to take away the POTUS’ powers through a congressional plea and forced votes in both the House and Senate, all of which were unsuccessful. Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a US Marine Corps veteran and part of the brigade against President Trump, wrote on X earlier today that the strikes are “illegal” and “the second unjustified war in his lifetime.” According to TRM Labs’ Country Crypto Adoption Index, Venezuela rose to 11th place globally in 2025, up from 14th in 2024, with just 27 million and a per capita GDP of $3,100. Venezuelans are using cryptocurrencies to preserve savings and to shield themselves from an unstable, inflation-ridden economy. The Trump critics propounded that airstrikes could stifle a growing crypto economy and destroy its oil economy that is already entangled with USDT. “If the United States succeeds in imposing control over Venezuela, and by extension over the world’s largest proven oil reserves, it will mark a major shift in global power. What happens in Venezuela will not stay in Latin America. It will shape the limits of American power, and the direction of geopolitical confrontation far beyond Caracas,” said Iranian journalist Ibrahim Majed.

The pre-launch phase began on April 1, following the conclusion of the presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market’s revival continues, with Bitcoin (BTC) on the verge of reclaiming $90,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% at $89,440. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other tokens are also trading in positive territory. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Reaches $0.00024675 Husky Inu AI’s (HINU) latest price increase has taken the value of the HINU token from $0.00024581 to $0.00024675. The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project has raised $917,618 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Investors had adopted a wait-and-watch approach, but the recent uptick suggests risk appetite has returned. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. Official Launch Date Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Continues Uptrend Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market extended its uptrend as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and other tokens traded in positive territory. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $90,000 mark on January 2, reaching an intraday high of $90,832. However, with sellers active above $90,000, bulls lost momentum as the price dipped back below $90,000. However, buyers have prevented further downside, as BTC has held above $89,000. The price is up nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $89,634. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $3,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied from $3,025 to an intraday high of $3,143 before moving to $3,095, up over 2%. Ripple (XRP) is up 7% and Solana (SOL) is up over 2% at $130. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 7% and Cardano (ADA) is trading in positive territory, up 6% at $0.386. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable price increases over the past 24 hours. As a result, the crypto market cap is up 1.15% at $3.06 trillion. 24-hour trading volume has also registered a substantial increase of 68% to reach $118 billion.

56769737,https://cryptonews.com/?p=470041,1767446287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56769737.jpeg,Santiment Warns FOMO Could Return if Bitcoin Hits $92K,https://cryptonews.com/news/santiment-warns-fomo-could-return-if-bitcoin-hits-92k/,cryptonews,"Crypto analytics platform Santiment has cautioned that retail FOMO could emerge if Bitcoin climbs above $92,000. The warning comes as Bitcoin trades near $90,000 early in 2026, with social sentiment showing its strongest bullish spike in six months despite modest trading volumes during the post-holiday period. Source: TradingView Brian, Santiment’s head of content, noted during a January 2nd livestream that Bitcoin’s approach toward the psychological $90,000 threshold typically triggers retail buying pressure. “ Usually when we see something like 89.9K, there’s a bit of a retail push to at least hit that milestone, ” he explained, adding that such moves often precede increased volatility as limit sells activate and FOMO intensifies. Mixed Signals as New Year Trading Begins Market data reveals a complex picture as 2026 opens. Bitcoin’s social volume remained flat, with just a 0.06% change from the previous week, while Ethereum saw a minimal increase of 1%. Mid-cap altcoins attracted more attention, with Dogecoin discussions jumping 57% and Cardano rising 19%, suggesting retail interest may be shifting toward smaller assets after what traders called “ the bloodbath that was the end of 2025. “ Source: X/@santimentfeed Santiment’s positive-versus-negative sentiment ratio for Bitcoin reached nearly 2:1 on January 1st, the highest reading since early October. This marks the strongest bullish sentiment shift in over six months, though analysts remain cautious about interpreting the surge. “ I’m not necessarily going to be too worried about a lot of FOMO going on right now, ” Brian stated, noting the timing coincides with traders returning from holidays rather than genuine conviction. The sentiment spike appears exclusive to Bitcoin, with Ethereum and XRP showing more neutral readings. Mentions of “ higher or above ” also outweighed “ lower or below ” references, reinforcing the optimistic tone among retail traders. However, historical patterns suggest extreme bullish sentiment often precedes corrections as markets move contrary to crowd expectations. Whale Accumulation Provides Bullish Foundation On-chain metrics paint a more encouraging picture beneath the surface noise. Wallets holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin accumulated approximately 65,500 BTC since November 30th, with 55,400 BTC added in just the past two weeks alone. This represents the highest percentage of supply held by whales and sharks since November 10th. Maxim Balashevich, Santiment’s founder and CEO, suggested the current price action could reflect anticipation of MicroStrategy’s expected weekend purchases. “ There could be some players betting on the Saylor, ” he noted. “ Maybe can engage some retail jump to the wagon of new year buying might work. “ The accumulation pattern contrasts with retail behavior, as smaller wallets holding less than 0.01 Bitcoin continued adding to positions throughout the recent volatility. This simultaneous buying from both whales and retail investors creates uncertainty, as historical patterns favor rallies when large holders accumulate while small traders sell. $BTC path into 2026 looks increasingly mixed • $100K lost, no late-year rally • ETFs see outflows, macro pressure grows • Whales still accumulating on dips #Bitcoin #BTC #2026 https://t.co/24wCTbRK7W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 Choppy Waters Expected Before Directional Move Santiment analysts expect sideways trading through the weekend before clearer signals emerge. “ We need to wait until Monday to get more data ,” Balashevich stated, noting that many U.S. traders remain on holiday until next week. He anticipates potential upside through Sunday, driven by speculation around institutional buying, followed by either downside on Monday or continued consolidation, depending on broader market conditions. The 30-day market-to-realized-value ratio sits near breakeven, while the 365-day metric shows long-term holders down 11.5% from October’s all-time high of $126,000. Network growth remained strong at year-end, though profit-taking spiked to six-week highs on January 2nd as traders capitalized on the move toward $90,000. Looking ahead, Santiment emphasizes monitoring whether Bitcoin can break above $92,000 without triggering excessive retail enthusiasm. The platform’s data suggests that while whale accumulation provides bullish underpinning, a FOMO-driven rally above key resistance levels could set up conditions for a sharper correction once speculative fever peaks.

56770068,652163,1767441618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56770068.jpeg,Crypto Market Oracle: The Whale Who Nailed Every Top Makes 3 Bold Predictions For This Year,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-oracle-3-predictions-for-this-year/,bitcoinist,"Market expert DeFi Tracer has compiled a series of predictions from an influential figure in the cryptocurrency market — specifically, a “whale,” or an investor with a large portfolio. This particular whale has accurately anticipated every Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high and numerous crypto market tops since 2015. Long-term Vision The whale’s latest forecasts for 2026, unveiled in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), include an ambitious target of $250,000 for Bitcoin (BTC), $20,000 for Ethereum (ETH), and $1,500 for Solana (SOL). However, this whale’s insights extend beyond mere numbers. He emphasizes the current phase of infrastructure development that encompasses critical elements such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), custodial services, regulatory advancements, and the strategic adjustments made by corporate balance sheets. According to his analysis, the market’s transition into this new phase often triggers an initial decline in prices as speculation fades. He suggests that the rise won’t be immediate; instead, it will involve a gradual, steady demand as the market stabilizes. While not explicitly stated, his model indicates that he does not anticipate a quick surge in prices. Instead, he envisions “a pressure phase” characterized by several key developments: weak hands are shaken out, credit positions are liquidated, and “easy” leverage is removed from the market. This transition—moving from speculation to accumulation—typically follows a predictable sequence: speculation leads to heightened volatility , which is then followed by liquidations and fear, causing retail investors to exit. Ultimately, exits pave the way for stabilization, which sets the stage for future upside. What To Expect For Crypto In 2026 In this context, DeFi Tracer suggests that Bitcoin might experience a decline to around $50,000 before the accumulation phase begins in earnest. This implies a potential 44% correction ahead for the cryptocurrency from current trading levels slightly above $89,600. The reasoning behind this perspective is straightforward: the market requires a cleansing process before launching into a new bull run. Looking toward 2026, the indicators suggest that the whale’s analysis is on point. Signs indicate that the necessary cleansing of the market is nearing completion and that the long-awaited growth phase is just around the corner. Several macroeconomic factors underline this optimism. Notably, metals have reached all-time highs and are now shifting capital into cryptocurrencies. The traditional four-year market cycle has drawn to a close, while governments worldwide are showing increasing interest in acquiring cryptocurrencies. The expert concluded that while 2025 was marked by a correction and cleansing of the crypto market, 2026 is poised for what the whale describes as structural growth. This process will reportedly be methodical and steady rather than rapid and chaotic, suggesting a systematic recovery for cryptocurrencies.

She argued that vague rules have long caused crypto companies to relocate overseas, noting that the proposed crypto legislation would alleviate uncertainty, establish clear rules, strengthen protections, and make the US a global leader. Insiders said that US lawmakers would review the CLARITY Act on January 15. If the markup goes through favorably, however, it would imply that lawmakers believe the bill will have sufficient support to pass a formal committee vote. At the same time, the push for clearer crypto rules comes as the United States grapples with a rapidly expanding national debt, which has climbed above $38 trillion , intensifying scrutiny of the country’s long-term fiscal outlook. Rising interest costs and persistent deficits have renewed interest among policymakers and investors in alternative financial technologies that could improve market efficiency and capital formation. John D’Agostino believes the bill will be enacted soon Speaking on the bill, Lummis urged legislators on X: “Our market structure legislation changes that by establishing clear jurisdiction, strong protections, and ensuring America leads the way. Let’s get this done!” In their review, legislators will be examining where DeFi aligns with federal law. They will also explore how to better distinguish between the SEC and CFTC’s roles in regulating digital assets. John D’Agostino, the Institutional Head of Strategy at Coinbase, says the bill is already on the path to progress, and he remains optimistic about its steady improvement, despite frustration from the crypto sector. He also expects the strategic bill to be passed soon. He addressed the bill’s delay in an interview with CNBC, saying that since the legislation is “fundamental” to crypto and other real asset classes, it is only reasonable that it takes time. There is a strong chance that the CLARITY Act will be enacted, he added, referring to growing global regulatory momentum and Spain’s forward-leaning initiatives as examples. Spain has already begun passing new cryptocurrency legislation, like the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8). D’Agostino also said that US lawmakers might feel pressured to act swiftly as other nations ramp up their cryptocurrency efforts. He added he hopes the bill can be approved this January. He also compared the bill to the GENIUS Act, stating that the former is more complex than the latter. But he sees the GENIUS Act as transformative, adding that the passage of the CLARITY Act would be another crucial milestone in the US’s crypto journey ahead. The CLARITY Act would need 60 votes to move forward If the Republicans voted as a bloc, the CLARITY Act would likely pass the committee level even without Democratic support. But its eventual passage would be more contentious. After the Senate Agriculture Committee piece is merged, 60 votes will be necessary in the Senate to end debate, hence the importance of cross-party support. Tim Scott, the chair of the Banking Committee, spoke to reporters ahead of the recess, saying the conversations with Democrats were fruitful, and some industry players responded cautiously with optimism. If the legislation were enacted, this would create rules that regulate the digital asset market in a way that moves beyond long-term, enforcement-driven regulation. It would also clarify which token types are considered securities or commodities, explain how exchanges and brokers can register, and enable regulators to exert more control over spot crypto. Supporters also said the changes would provide regulatory clarity and strengthen consumer protections, as well as America’s standing compared to places with clear frameworks for cryptocurrencies.

According to reports, the sophisticated phishing campaign is currently circulating within the community, posing significant risks to users intending to download the newly announced Eternl Desktop application. The hackers craft professional emails claiming to promote a legitimate wallet solution designed for secure Cardano staking and governance participation. The announcement uses terms related to users earning rewards, including NIGHT and ATMA token rewards through the current crypto giveaway program, to establish credibility and drive user engagement. Hackers are targeting Cardano wallet users According to reports, the hackers were able to create a replica of the official Eternl Desktop announcement, complementing it with a message about hardware wallet compatibility, local key management, and advanced delegation control. The email shows a polished, professional tone with proper grammar and no visible spelling errors, making it very effective at deceiving Cardano community members. Meanwhile, it distributes malware to any system it enters. Reports mentioned that the campaign uses a newly registered domain, download(dot)eternldesktop(dot)network, to distribute a malicious installer package without the need for an official verification or digital signature validation. In the detailed technical analysis carried out by Anurag, an independent threat hunter and malware analyst, the legitimate Eternl.msi file contains a hidden LogMeIn Resolve remote management tool bundled within its installation package. The discovery exposed a supply chain abuse attempt aimed at establishing persistent unauthorized access on victim systems. The malicious MSI installer, with a size of 23.3 megabytes and with hash 8fa4844e40669c1cb417d7cf923bf3e0, drops an executable called unattended updater.exe, which uses the original filename GoToResolveUnattendedUpdater.exe. During runtime analysis, the executable creates an identified folder structure under the system’s Program Files. Once it creates the Program Files, it creates a directory and writes multiple configurations, including unattended.json, logger.json, mandatory.json, and pc.json. The unattended.json configuration file enables remote access functionality without needing the user to interact. The dropped executable attempts to establish connections to infrastructure associated with legitimate GoTo Resolve Services, including devices-iot.console.gotoresolve.com and dumpster.console.gotoresolve.com. Malware provides hackers with remote access According to network analysis, the malware sends information to the hackers in JSON format. It also uses remote servers to establish a communication channel for command execution and system monitoring. Security researchers say this behavior is important because remote management tools allow hackers to carry out remote command execution and steal credentials once the malware is installed on a victim’s system. The Cardano phishing campaign also shows how hackers use crypto and the branding of legitimate platforms to distribute tools that have been infected with malware. This means that users need to verify the authenticity of the software they use through official channels. In addition, they must also avoid downloading wallet applications from unverified sources or newly registered domains, irrespective of how good their distribution emails appear. This Cardano phishing campaign is similar to the one that targeted customers using Meta for advertisements last year. Users are lured with emails that claim their ads have been temporarily suspended due to violations of advertising policies and EU regulations. The scammers even go as far as making it appear legitimate by adding the official Instagram branding and official-sounding language about policy violations. However, closer inspection showed that the emails were from a different domain. Researchers mentioned that upon clicking the link, users are redirected to a fake Meta Business page that looks convincing. The website mimics the real support site, opening up with a page that warns the user that their account faces termination if they do not take action immediately. Users are tricked into inputting their Ad login into the spaces provided, with the customer support guiding them with a provided step-by-step instruction to restore their accounts.

According to the report, scammers stole close to $33 million from victims. The FBI noted that in most cases, scammers impersonated either a company or a bank to carry out their illicit activities. The FBI claimed that some bad actors went as far as calling their victims and advising them to deposit money into a Bitcoin ATM to protect their funds. The criminals would tell them that their accounts have been compromised, riding on the panic to push them into sending the funds via a Bitcoin ATM for safekeeping. Instead, the money goes to a wallet or account maintained by the hacker or another person in their network. Bitcoin ATM fraud hits a new record in 2025 Bitcoin ATMs increased in popularity in the United States, with more than 30,000 machines in the state in 2024. The figure represents 81.27% of the total Bitcoin ATMs in the world, according to Finance Magnates. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) mentioned that more than 10,000 people were victims of Bitcoin ATM fraud in 2025 alone. The agency mentioned that there were over 12,000 complaints from January to December in 2025. In its statement, the FBI also mentioned that the monetary value lost to criminals reached $333.5 million, an increase compared to the same time span last year. In 2024, the FTC reported that digital assets scams in particular were more financially devastating than other types of fraud, noting that midway through the year, the median loss reported by individuals related to crypto fraud was $5,400. The median individual loss tied to reports of general fraud stood at $447. The FBI mentioned that the amount lost to the criminals has been on the rise with each passing year. Data from the FTC showed that Bitcoin ATMs were responsible for $114 million in reported losses in 2023 and $78 million in losses in 2022. This means that the reported losses due to Bitcoin ATM fraud more than doubled in the last two years. Notably, these are figures of reported losses, with the FTC not accounting for losses that were not reported. FTC urges users to be cautious The FTC has advised people to pay close attention to all red flags when making transactions with Bitcoin ATMs. They have also advised people to double-check with their financial officer or banks whenever they are contacted by someone they do not know to deposit funds in a Bitcoin ATM. The agency also advised individuals to slow down and not allow the other person at the end of the line to rush them into making payments, noting that they should discuss things with people around them before making any payment. Bitcoin has been one of the few instruments used to carry out fraud, with criminals choosing to use the asset because of its privacy-focused transactions. The FTC has also warned that government agencies and legitimate businesses will not contact users and ask them to pay for services in Bitcoin. Except otherwise stated, users should not pay for any service or goods using Bitcoin ATMs. In a case where someone is hounding them, they should report to the police. While fraud does not only affect certain demographics, scammers have been targeting the older generations more. This is because they are susceptible to crypto crimes, the data shows. In the report, victims 60 and above account for 715 of the reported losses using Bitcoin ATMs during the first half of 2024, losing $46 million according to the FTC. In some cases, the criminals used AI deepfakes of a family member, asking the elderly person to pay Bitcoin in exchange for their release from the police station. Get seen where it counts.

The premier cryptocurrency closed 2025 with a range-bound price performance, recording no significant movement in the past month of December. However, beneath this early price strength, recent on-chain evaluation reveals that Bitcoin may be at a critical point, where positive price action contrasts with underlying market dynamics. Negative Ratios Don’t Mean Price Bottoms: Alphractal CEO Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson recently took to X to explain what a negative Sharpe Ratio could mean for the Bitcoin price. For context, the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio is a metric that measures how efficiently Bitcoin’s returns compensate investors for the level of volatility (risk) taken over a given period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K Readings above 1 from this metric signal a healthy market, where investors are getting rewards for their stakes. On the other hand, values under 0 typically indicate that the market is in a high-risk, low-return state. Simply put, Bitcoin’s investors, in this scenario, are not being efficiently rewarded for their contributed capital. As observed in the chart above, the ratio recently slipped below the 0 threshold. Seeing as this is occurring while price regains previous levels, it becomes clear that there is an inefficiency between risk allocation and returns. Wedson further shared, based on historical data, that Bitcoin typically displays its best performance when its Sharpe Ratio is well above zero, particularly at levels 1 and above. This positive signal is usually proof of a consistent state of balance between risk and reward. In contrast, negative readings often correlate with prolonged consolidation periods, choppy price movements, or even cycle transitions, providing context to long-term investors on current market dynamics. Historically, these periods have appeared during cooling phases, or before sentiment resets, rather than precisely at market bottoms. By extension, this means that while downside risk may not be high, upside efficiency remains limited until market conditions see relevant improvement. Ultimately, Wedson concluded that the current level of the Sharpe Ratio calls for cautious optimism, especially as the low doesn’t necessarily mean the bottom is in. Bitcoin Price 2026 Outlook After closing 2025 in the red, the question has been swirling around how the Bitcoin price would perform in the new year. While various verdicts have filtered across the crypto community, weighted sentiment suggests that the market leader would continue its struggles in 2026. The lack of apparent demand growth shows that BTC might have already entered a bear market, with the bottom not due until the last quarter of 2026. In essence, the premier cryptocurrency might see an extended period of correction over the next few months. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at approximately $89,886, reflecting a 1.4% price jump over the past day.

While the price action remains below major moving averages, the recent bullish push is giving traders a reason to watch closely. Momentum is shifting, but major resistance levels still need to be cleared to confirm a reversal. XRP Technical Analysis: The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRPUSDT is trading around $2.00 after bouncing from the $1.8 support zone. The price is still within a descending channel, but today’s daily candle is testing the upper trendline. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages are sitting above, acting as dynamic resistance above the $2.30 zone. If the asset breaks the descending channel and flips this resistance zone, the next target lies around $2.50 and beyond. The RSI has broken above 60, suggesting strengthening momentum, but it is approaching overbought territory, which could cause short-term consolidation. The BTC Pair On the XRPBTC chart, the price has pushed strongly into the 2,230 sat region, after bouncing just above the 2,000 sat key mid-range level. The pair is now eyeing the critical supply zone at 2,500 sats. Earlier in December, the 100-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish outlook, with the former now acting as immediate resistance. Yet, the RSI is now accelerating upward, as the price is pushing higher aggressively. If the current momentum holds, XRP could challenge the upper resistance bands soon.

Back then, almost no one noticed. Fast-forward to today, seventeen years later, that creation has now become one of the most disruptive financial inventions in modern history, surviving ridicule, banks, crashes, and countless declarations of its death. Happy birthday, Bitcoin! 17-Years Old In its infancy, BTC was little more than an experiment among cryptographers and libertarians. It didn’t really have a known price, there were no exchanges where you could openly trade it, and there was no clear use case beyond peer-to-peer value transfer, which was actually intended in the whitepaper. The first known transaction occurred in May 2010 – the infamous Bitcoin Pizza Day , as it is referred to now, when 10,000 BTC was used to purchase two pizzas. At the time, though, Bitcoin was dismissed as a toy for geeks, a failed attempt at digital cash, or as “magical internet money” with no intrinsic value. Later, the first actual attention from the mainstream was for all the wrong reasons. Darknet marketplaces thrived in the early 2010s, and BTC became associated with illegal activity, drugs, and crime, which earned it a reputation as the currency of the underworld. The legacy media quickly labeled it a tool for criminals, and regulators warned that it had no legitimate future. That stigma followed it for years, despite later data showing that illicit activity accounted for only a small fraction of all BTC transactions. From Dead to Trillion-Dollar Asset Bitcoin’s debut on exchanges made it clear that the asset will face some enhanced volatility. It surged, it crashed, then surged again, only to collapse again, and then rise back up. This scenario has repeated countless times for the past over a decade. Given the fact that some of those corrections were by 50%, 60%, or even 80% at times, haters used every moment to call it ‘dead.’ In fact, there are roughly 450 such cases documented since 2010. It was called a bubble or “rat poison square.” It has been compared to the tulip mania, and renowned economists have warned that it would go to zero. However, it never did. Instead, it kept proving them wrong. The narrative began to change during the bull run in 2017 and was solidified after the COVID-19 crash and the subsequent rally. As governments printed unprecedented amounts of fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million units started to matter. Gradually, it was no longer pitched as just “digital cash.” It became something more: digital gold to some, a hedge against monetary debasement to others, or even a long-term store of value. It was further legitimized in 2024 when roughly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States. Later, it became a key factor in the country’s presidential elections, and there are talks about a US-based BTC strategic reserve. Not bad for a teenager. Community Celebrates Naturally, the ever-vocal cryptocurrency community was quick to celebrate Bitcoin’s birthday, which helped launch a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Strategy’s Saylor, the champion behind the world’s largest corporate BTC holder, published an orange cake on X, wishing the cryptocurrency a happy birthday, while Lucky posted: Seventeen years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world. What began as a quiet experiment is now a global monetary network.

The 70-megawatt facility was sold for up to $30 million, a move that the company says will free cash for projects in North America. Reports have disclosed the deal as part of Bitfarms’ plan to focus its energy and compute efforts closer to home. Sale Terms And Payout Schedule According to the company, the buyer is the Sympatheia Power Fund , managed by Singapore’s Hawksburn Capital, and the agreement calls for $9 million in cash at closing plus additional milestone payments that could total up to $21 million. A $1 million non-refundable deposit was already paid, and the remaining payments are tied to post-closing conditions expected to be completed over roughly 10 months. The transaction is expected to close within about 60 days, subject to customary conditions. Why Bitfarms Is Moving North Based on reports , Bitfarms’ management said the sale helps it concentrate on North American energy and computing work. Chief Executive Ben Gagnon was quoted saying that the deal brings forward an estimated two to three years of anticipated free cash flows, which will be reinvested into North American high-performance computing and AI energy infrastructure in 2026. The company now says its energy portfolio is 100% North American. Market Reaction And Context Markets reacted quickly after the announcement. Traders noted an uptick in Bitfarms’ stock following news of the sale, reflecting investor interest in the company’s cash-flow move and strategic refocus. This sale follows earlier asset moves in Paraguay, including the transfer of other sites in recent months, showing a steady pullback from South America. Sympatheia Power Fund, the buyer, is presented as an infrastructure fund that will take over the Paso Pe site and related operations. Reports describe the fund as being managed by Hawksburn Capital, which is based in Singapore. The buyer’s intentions for the site were not fully detailed in the announcement, but the transfer was framed as a normal handoff of a running energy and mining asset. Analysts have watched miners rework portfolios since the Bitcoin halving and as demand for data compute has risen. Some companies are shifting assets toward flexible power use or repurposing sites for AI and HPC workloads. Bitfarms’ move is one of several examples where operators sell overseas plants and redeploy capital into the US and Canada.

Source: TradingView CryptoPotato reported earlier today that the primary cryptocurrency dipped from almost $91,000 – its peak on Friday, to just under $89,300 after reports emerged about explosions in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas.

This strategic enhancement, effective immediately, represents a major commitment to transparency and accessibility in the volatile crypto sector. Consequently, traders and investors worldwide will now receive continuous updates during core trading hours. The move addresses the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency markets, which operate without traditional closing bells. Therefore, this development marks a pivotal moment for financial journalism in the digital age. Bitcoin World’s Enhanced 24-Hour News Coverage Schedule Bitcoin World’s new operational framework establishes a clear and structured timeline for news delivery. The platform will now provide uninterrupted, real-time cryptocurrency news coverage from Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC through Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC. This schedule strategically covers the vast majority of active global trading periods across major financial hubs. During the designated window from Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC to Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC, the editorial team will shift to a monitored standby mode. However, they will publish immediate updates for major breaking news events, such as regulatory announcements, significant security breaches, or extreme market volatility. This balanced approach ensures resource sustainability while maintaining critical coverage. The decision follows extensive analysis of global trading volume data and reader engagement patterns. Major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken report consistent liquidity throughout the week. For instance, weekend trading often sees heightened volatility due to lower liquidity, making timely news even more crucial. Bitcoin World’s schedule now aligns perfectly with these market realities. The editorial team has implemented a structured shift system to manage the expanded hours effectively. This system ensures consistent editorial standards and fact-checking protocols are maintained around the clock. Furthermore, the platform has invested in additional monitoring tools for global regulatory wires and blockchain analytics. Addressing the 24/7 Nature of Digital Asset Markets Unlike traditional stock markets, cryptocurrency networks never close. Blockchain transactions settle continuously, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols operate autonomously at all hours. This creates an insatiable need for timely information. A 2024 report by the Crypto Market Integrity Coalition highlighted that over 35% of major price movements occur outside standard U.S. market hours. Bitcoin World’s new schedule directly mitigates this information gap. The platform will now track developments across all time zones, from Asian market openings to North American late-night sessions. This comprehensive coverage is essential for risk management and informed decision-making. The Strategic Rationale Behind Expanded Crypto Journalism This expansion is not merely a logistical change but a strategic response to evolving market demands. The cryptocurrency industry has matured significantly, attracting institutional investors, regulated funds, and corporate treasuries. These professional participants require reliable, constant information flows to manage portfolios and comply with oversight requirements. Bitcoin World’s initiative fills a notable void in the current media landscape. Many traditional financial news outlets still treat crypto as a niche segment, offering sporadic coverage. In contrast, dedicated crypto media often lacks the structured editorial rigor of established news organizations. Bitcoin World aims to bridge this divide by applying journalistic standards to continuous coverage. The platform’s editorial director cited the increasing correlation between crypto assets and macroeconomic news as a key driver. Events like Federal Reserve announcements, inflation data releases, or geopolitical tensions now instantly impact digital asset prices. These events can occur at any time. Therefore, having a dedicated team to provide context and analysis in real-time adds tremendous value for the community. The schedule also accounts for the global nature of crypto regulation. Important policy statements from authorities in Europe, Asia, or the Middle East can happen during traditional off-hours for Western media. Continuous coverage ensures these developments are reported without delay. Key operational highlights of the new schedule include: Real-time alerts for market-moving events like exchange outages or large wallet movements. Scheduled analysis of daily market opens in Asia, Europe, and North America. Live coverage of major blockchain network upgrades or governance votes. Breaking news protocols for security incidents and regulatory actions. Implementing Journalistic Rigor on a Continuous Clock Maintaining accuracy and neutrality during 24-hour operations presents unique challenges. Bitcoin World has developed a multi-layered verification system to address this. All breaking news alerts undergo a two-source confirmation minimum before publication. The editorial team utilizes a tiered response system, categorizing events by urgency and potential impact. For example, a suspected exchange hack triggers an immediate factual bulletin, followed by deeper investigative reporting. This process balances speed with reliability. The platform also employs blockchain forensic tools to verify on-chain events independently. This technical capability strengthens its reporting and builds trust with a technically savvy audience. Impact on Traders, Investors, and the Crypto Ecosystem The primary beneficiaries of this expanded coverage are active market participants. Day traders, algorithmic trading firms, and institutional desks rely on minute-by-minute information to execute strategies. Even long-term investors benefit from immediate awareness of fundamental changes, such as protocol failures or regulatory shifts. Enhanced news transparency can also improve overall market health. Studies in traditional finance, like those from the MIT Sloan School, show that timely information dissemination reduces information asymmetry and can decrease volatility spikes. In crypto’s often-opaque markets, reliable journalism acts as a public good. It empowers all participants with equal access to critical facts. Furthermore, the move raises the bar for crypto media as a whole. It signals a transition from blog-style commentary to professional, around-the-clock journalism. This evolution is crucial for the asset class’s legitimacy. As more traditional finance players enter the space, they expect information standards comparable to those covering equities or bonds. Bitcoin World’s investment in continuous coverage meets this expectation head-on. The schedule also supports the growing ecosystem of crypto derivatives. Futures and options traders, in particular, need to monitor news constantly to manage leverage and risk. A gap in coverage could lead to significant, avoidable losses for these market participants. Comparison of Crypto News Coverage Models Model Coverage Hours Typical Update Speed Best For Traditional Financial News Market Hours + Breaking Minutes to Hours Macro Overview Social Media / Forums 24/7 (Unofficial) Instant (Unverified) Sentiment & Rumors Dedicated Crypto Blogs Business Hours Hours Deep-Dive Analysis Bitcoin World (New Model) 24/7 with Structured Breaks Real-Time (Verified) Active Trading & Risk Management Conclusion Bitcoin World’s implementation of a structured 24-hour cryptocurrency news coverage schedule represents a substantial advancement for the industry. This initiative directly responds to the non-stop nature of digital asset markets and the professionalization of its participants. By providing verified, real-time news during core global trading hours, the platform enhances market transparency and empowers better decision-making. The careful balance of continuous coverage with scheduled maintenance periods ensures editorial sustainability and quality. Ultimately, this move strengthens the foundational information layer of the crypto ecosystem, supporting its continued growth and integration into the global financial system. As the market evolves, such commitments to rigorous, accessible journalism will remain indispensable. FAQs Q1: What exactly are the new operating hours for Bitcoin World’s news coverage? The platform now provides full, real-time coverage from Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC until Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC. From Saturday 3:00 p.m. to Sunday 10:00 p.m. UTC, it operates in a breaking-news-only mode. Q2: Why is 24-hour coverage necessary for cryptocurrency news? Cryptocurrency markets and blockchain networks operate continuously, unlike traditional stock exchanges. Major price movements, hacks, and regulatory news can happen at any time, requiring constant information access for effective trading and risk management. Q3: How will Bitcoin World ensure news accuracy during overnight or weekend shifts? The platform employs a multi-source verification system, dedicated monitoring tools, and a tiered editorial protocol. All breaking news requires confirmation from at least two independent sources before publication, maintaining rigorous standards. Q4: Does this mean there will be no news at all during the shorter Saturday-to-Sunday window? No. During that period, the team will monitor for and publish updates only for major breaking news events, such as significant exchange issues, critical regulatory announcements, or severe market disruptions. Q5: How does this change benefit the average crypto investor, not just active traders? All investors benefit from timely, accurate information. Long-term holders need to know about fundamental threats like network vulnerabilities or regulatory changes immediately. This coverage reduces information asymmetry and helps everyone make more informed decisions.

December ended with 58 disclosed investment projects, up 3.6% from 56 in November. Monthly funding moved in the opposite direction. Disclosed capital for December totaled $860 million, down 94.1% from $14.54 billion in November. Crypto deal activity contracts while capital concentrates The entirety of 2025 saw 898 disclosed investment projects, a 42.1% plunge from 1,551 projects in 2024, meaning few deals are carrying far larger checks across the crypto venture capital market. According to RootData, DeFi took the largest share at 22.4% of total crypto VC projects, CeFi followed at 13.8%, while AI had 12.7%. RWA and DePIN made up 7.3%, as L1 and L2 projects reached 6%, and NFT/GameFi slipped to 5.3%, matching tools and wallets at 5%. The year’s largest transaction landed in November when Naver agreed to acquire Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, in an all‑stock deal valued at about $10.3 billion, pushing Naver’s value to 4.9 trillion won and Dunamu’s to 15.1 trillion won. Crypopolitan had in October reported that Dunamu saw consolidated operating income of 1.19 trillion won for the first nine months of 2025, up 22% year-over-year, with 97.9% of revenue tied to trading platforms, including Upbit. In May, Coinbase completed a $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, paying $700 million in cash and the remainder in stock. Mega financing deals boost corporate balance sheets holding crypto Corporate issuance drove many of the year’s largest crypto VC raises, starting in July when Strategy raised $2.52 billion through its fourth preferred stock product, Stretch, with net proceeds of about $2.474 billion after fees. Crypopolitan then reported that Strategy used the funds to buy 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256, making its total holdings now 628,791 BTC, or $74 billion. Earlier in February, Strategy had issued $2 billion in zero‑coupon notes due 2030, carrying a 40% to 50% conversion premium and a three‑year put option. In October, Intercontinental Exchange, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in Polymarket at an $8 billion pre‑investment valuation. The deal gave ICE a stake and global distribution rights for Polymarket’s event‑driven data. In March, Abu Dhabi MGX (funded by the Abu Dhabi government and controlled by the royal family) invested $2 billion in Binance for a minority stake, paid for using stablecoins exclusively, and became the largest crypto‑asset‑only investment recorded. In September, Forward Industries completed a $1.65 billion private placement using cash and stablecoins to launch a Solana‑based digital asset vault strategy, led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. In March, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, securing a CFTC‑registered FCM license to offer futures and derivatives in the United States while expanding in the U.K., EU, and Australia.

These patterns help traders and investors understand the mechanics behind rotations, momentum, and accumulation across major digital assets. While individual performance varies, analyzing structural formations provides insight into how capital may flow between Bitcoin and altcoins over extended periods. This framework was highlighted by a pseudonymous X user, Stockmoney Lizards, a crypto strategist renowned for studying cross-asset dynamics and technical setups. He noted that even assets he is less bullish on, such as XRP, can serve as clear examples of multi-year breakout patterns, offering a template to observe broader market behavior. Altcoins Form a Comparable Structure Stockmoney Lizards observed that altcoins, measured against Bitcoin, are forming a structure similar to XRP’s breakout pattern. Currently, many altcoins remain technically oversold, signaling potential for recovery once broader market conditions align. I am not a huge fan of XRP, but it will serve as an example for a multi-year breakout pattern, I have rarely seen before. If you look at Altcoins chart vs. BTC (lower image), a similar formation is just building up. My scenario for 2026 would be as follows: – Bitcoin maybe… pic.twitter.com/ezo0MwnOb1 — Stockmoney Lizards (@StockmoneyL) January 2, 2026 Historical trends suggest that assets showing such setups often attract algorithm-driven activity first, which then pulls in retail and institutional traders, amplifying momentum. This indicates that, while Bitcoin may consolidate or range initially, capital could rotate into altcoins , creating upward pressure across the sector. Understanding these patterns provides traders with actionable insight beyond simple speculation. Projected Market Rotation in 2026 According to Stockmoney Lizards, Bitcoin may range for a period before breaking out to a new all-time high. Following this, Bitcoin dominance could decline, allowing altcoins to recover strongly. Even if altcoins face another corrective phase toward the end of 2026, this cycle could establish higher bases compared to current levels, setting the foundation for the next upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This scenario relies on structural market principles rather than speculation. The concept of money rotation, well-known in traditional finance, predicts that capital flows from previously dominant assets to underperforming but technically promising alternatives, often fueling sustained momentum. Technical Catalysts and Institutional Support Structural catalysts also support this rotation. Multiple ETF launches targeting crypto exposure , including altcoins, enhance liquidity and attract institutional participation. These factors increase the likelihood of rapid market moves once technical reversals confirm initial trends. Assets that have underperformed significantly become more appealing as investors seek value and diversification. Patterns Over Preference Stockmoney Lizards emphasizes that the lesson lies in observing patterns rather than personal preference. XRP illustrates how multi-year breakout formations provide insight into potential altcoin surges and broader market rotations. By studying these structures, traders can anticipate flows between Bitcoin and altcoins, positioning themselves to capitalize on both short-term reversals and long-term trends.

56776586,652183,1767457859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56776586.jpeg,Binance Bitcoin STH Activity Falls By $8 Billion In December  — Here’s Why,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sth-activity-falls-by-8-billion-in-december/,bitcoinist,"Initially, Bitcoin began the last month of 2025 with significant bearish momentum, with the price structure taking on a clear bearish direction. However, this downside momentum soon weakened after the flagship cryptocurrency encountered its $85,000 support. Since then, Bitcoin traded mostly within a consolidatory range, struggling to break out of either end of the chart convincingly. Interestingly, an on-chain analysis has been released that examines the dynamics that may have influenced BTC’s December performance. Binance Inflows See Rapid Monthly Decline From $24.7B To $16.54B In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, market expert CryptoOnchain shares findings on evaluating inflows into Binance in the name of Bitcoin. The indicator involved in this analysis is the Binance Monthly Inflow By UTXO Age metric, which determines how much Bitcoin (in USD or BTC terms) flows into Binance each month, broken down by the age of the UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) being deposited. CryptoOnchain highlights that this downturn in money inflows was influenced by young UTXOs (transactions less than a day old). From its November high of approximately $24.7 billion, the metric quickly dropped to $16.54 billion in December, marking an $8.16 billion inflow gap. Typically, young UTXOs are a means through which short-term speculative behavior can be tracked, seeing as they are representative of recently transferred coins. Hence, the significant drop in Binance inflow indicates a growing unwillingness among short-term holders to sell their coins. It is worth noting that heightened inflows from this investor group point to a growing inclination to sell. This translates to the Bitcoin price as elevated bearish pressure, which leads to short-term price corrections. The inflows decline in December is therefore an inversion. It reveals a “cooling of speculative activity,” which in turn translates on the charts as a significant loss of selling pressure. The crypto pundit further highlights possible reasons for this exodus of speculative activity. Structurally, the analyst conjectures that the inflow decline could be due to fading price momentum, characteristic of the final days of the year. Short-term holders might have exited the market due to caution, to observe what the new year brings, without getting caught in the mix. This action then causes a “handover of supply control” to Bitcoin’s mid-term and long-term investors. Historically, such transitions have been associated with consolidation phases and periods of lower volatility, where no significant amount of directional momentum is seen. Hence, if history is anything to go by, the Bitcoin price could be gearing up for sustainable cycles in the coming months.

The top cryptocurrency in the world ended the year with a negative performance of around 5% in value. The cryptocurrency is presently stuck in a narrow band around $88,410. Not many people are pleased with this performance in the market. It has been noticed that they are selling Bitcoin at a discount. Investors who are looking for actual growth have to come up with a different approach. They are leaving the stagnant coins behind and looking for projects which have the potential to make yields. One such cheap crypto project which smart money is showing interest in is called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for short. It provides a clear way to a massive profit thanks to a strong DeFi proposition. The Problem with a Stagnant Giant Bitcoin is considered digital gold and is wonderful for overall stability. However, it misses the strong yield structures exhibited by cheaper cryptocurrency projects. At the current moment, Bitcoin is exhibiting low volatility and a negative return on the year. This is putting the endurance of investors to the test. The constant pressure from selling indicates that investors are looking for alternatives. A Project Constructed With Value In Mind While the overall market is struggling, the purchase demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is immense. The presale of MUTM has already raked in over $19.5 million. Over 18,650 individuals have already owned the MUTM tokens. The current phase is Phase 7, and the cost of each unit of MUTM is $0.04. The current price is already 300% higher than that of Phase 1, but according to experts, the best days of MUTM are yet to come. The chance to acquire at a price of $0.04 will expire soon, at which point Phase 8 will commence at a higher price of $0.045. Acquiring the tokens now, prior to market listing at $0.06, will render an immediate profit for the investor. The possibility of appreciating further will kick off at market listing. Accumulate Rewards For Holding MUTM Mutuum Finance also has a system for rewarding its supporters. The fees generated through lending on the platform are used automatically to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. The tokens are then given out for free as dividends to the people who stake in the system. This is a very powerful feedback loop. The more people using Mutuum Finance, the more fees, and vice versa, the more tokens are bought back. The more buybacks, the bigger the rewards for holders. This ensures that long-term holders receive rewards twice. Mutuum Finance is almost ready to be launched. The V1 platform of Mutuum Finance is to be launched on the testnet very soon. The trustworthiness of the project has been made sure after the completion of a security audit performed by Halborn. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty program launched to find the bugs present in the platform. Investors who take proactive steps will see that this presale is their final opportunity before a price hike is introduced. Additionally, with a limited supply of tokens in circulation and a soon-to-be-launched platform, there is sufficient evidence that indicates that its price will appreciate. A Smart Move for Better Returns Whereas Bitcoin remains stagnant, shrewd investors are allocating their funds to projects with engines of growth. Mutuum Finance presents an opportunity that leans heavily on the concept of scarcity and utilizes the connection to the success of the platform as the driving factor. The presale phase of the platform is near completion. For those interested in turning market uncertainty into major portfolio growth, membership in the MUTM presale will prove to be an intelligent decision. It’s a choice to join a project intended for use in the future of finance.

CryptoGames tops our list for its user-friendly interface and rewarding experience, featuring huge jackpots and contests designed explicitly for Bitcoin enthusiasts. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means literally anyone with an internet connection can access a Bitcoin casino. However, the availability of these casinos does not mean they are US-licensed.","Deep Dive - Crypto, Web3 & Market Insights|BC.GAME|Cloudbet|CryptoGames|rollbit|Stake",BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,0,0,EN,"{

The numbers that many share on social media can be distorted by exchange moves, not fresh buying. That distortion matters because large transfers tied to exchanges can look like one entity is piling in, when the action is often internal bookkeeping. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Korbit Fined $1.90 Million By South Korean Regulators Whale Wallet Totals Can Be Misleading Exchange firms often merge funds from many small accounts into fewer large wallets for operational or compliance reasons. When that happens, onchain trackers may count those consolidated addresses as “whales,” inflating the apparent number of very large holders. According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, once those exchange-related shifts are removed from the data, the balance held by true large holders is still falling. Balances in addresses holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC have dropped, a trend that lines up with outflows from spot ETFs. No, whales are not buying enormous amount of Bitcoin. Most Bitcoin whale data out there has been “affected” by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances, this is why whales seem to have accumulated a lot of coins recently. We… pic.twitter.com/dk9XqqckIX — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) January 2, 2026 Long-Term Holders Turning Buyer Reports have disclosed that another group has shifted its behavior. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, says long-term holders have been net accumulators over the past 30 days after what was their biggest selling spree since 2019. That change could reduce one major source of selling pressure. It does not guarantee a rally, but it does mean at least one key cohort stopped adding to the sell side. Markets react to who is buying and who is selling, and this move by long-term holders softens the case that a single group is driving prices lower. Price Action Shows Mixed Signals Bitcoin has been hovering around the $90,000 area during thin holiday trading. At the time of reporting, the price was about $89,750 Saturday, with 24-hour volume near $52 billion. The token sits roughly 2.8% below a recent day high of $90,250 and carries a market capitalization of about $1.75 trillion based on a circulating supply close to 20 million BTC. Trading has seen sharp moves up and down, but volume has been weak, which means moves lack the support needed for a clear breakout or breakdown. Market Moves Hinge On ETF Flows Since US spot Bitcoin ETFs became active in early 2024, the ownership picture has changed. ETFs now hold a large share of on- and off-chain demand, which can shift where Bitcoin is stored and how flows appear on onchain charts. Reports suggest that ETF outflows have helped drive lower balances in the 100–1,000 BTC band, while at the same time some long-term holders are quietly buying.

Claims of a massive whale reaccumulation wave were overblown because they did not account for exchange consolidation. Yet the story is not one-sided. Long-term holders have shown buying interest, even as large non-exchange addresses continue to shed some holdings. Future price direction will likely depend on whether ETF flows return in size and whether trading volume picks up enough to confirm any move.

According to ScamSniffer, the user in question had signed a malicious “permit” signature, which was what led to the theft. That signature was an off-chain approval mechanism, and it allegedly allows tokens to be spent without triggering an immediate on-chain transaction. ScamSniffer shared screenshots of the transactions. As to how the victim was susceptible to the exploit, they believe the scammers would have gotten the victim to sign the permit via a phishing site or cloned dApp, giving them access to drain the wallet. How did the scam happen? SlowMist’s founder, Cosine, commented on the haul, pointing out that the specific phishing group behind the attack is not one of the “mainstream” drainer groups, which suggests an emergence of smaller, sophisticated independent attackers. They also moved fast, rapidly converting the funds to ETH and then laundering the funds immediately via Tornado Cash. The incident was highlighted on January 3 by ScamSniffer via its X page, not long after it dropped its 2025 yearly report. In the report , as reviewed by Cryptoplitan, it revealed there was an overall 83% drop in crypto phishing losses, falling from $494 million to $84 million. However, it emphasized that sophisticated wallet drainers still abound. They just seem to be targeting high-value holders with permit-oriented attacks, as is often the case during a bull market. Permit-based exploits depend on the user’s trust in routine signature requests that actually authorize token transfers off-chain. Unfortunately for scams like these, recovery is very unlikely as the draining happens on-chain and transactions are irreversible. Crypto phishing losses went down, but wrench attacks went up While ScamSniffer has confirmed crypto phishing losses went down in 2025, crypto security experts claim the frequency of so-called “$5 wrench attacks” went up. Ari Redbord, the global head of policy and government affairs at crypto analytics firm TRM Labs, called 2025 a record year for wrench attacks, with roughly 60 reported physical assaults on crypto holders, up from 41 in 2024 and 36 in 2021. However, Redbord believes the actual number of attacks that have happened is significantly higher. “Many incidents are logged simply as robberies or burglaries, with the crypto element omitted, while others are never reported due to victim hesitation or uncertainty about how law enforcement will handle crypto-related crimes,” Redbord claimed. The cybersecurity risk called the “ wrench attack ” derives its name from the idea that even the most sophisticated forms of encryption and data security are susceptible to physical coercion — like getting threatened by a “$5 wrench.” These attacks are inarguably worse than phishing exploits and protocol hacks as they not only put assets at risk but also lives, increasing the stakes for maintaining proper OPSEC beyond wallet management best practices. “No matter how many technical precautions you take or how many factors you authenticate with, no individual is immune to human attack vectors,” Tor Bair, CEO of Hybrid Minds Advisory and former president of the Secret Foundation, said. Although the true number of wrench attacks is difficult to quantify, there appears to be either a higher risk of victimization or, at least, a greater awareness of the threat. Last year May, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau spoke up about the rise of crypto-related assaults in the country, which at the time was the site of about one-third of wrench attacks in 2025, including the high-profile kidnapping and torture of Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife in January.

CryptoQuant Researcher Says No,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-really-back-in-the-market-cryptoquant-no/,bitcoinist,"The price of Bitcoin has made a solid start to the new year, jumping above the $90,000 mark on Friday, January 2nd. While this newly-found momentum could have been triggered by a plethora of factors, an on-chain expert has pointed out that whale activity is not one of them. Look Closer: BTC Whale Holdings Actually In Decline In a recent post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno argued that the largest Bitcoin investors are not back buying enormous amounts of BTC. This conclusion is based on the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change and Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart. As the name suggests, the Total Whale Holdings and Monthly % Change chart shows the total balance of addresses with more than 1,000 coins and how it has changed in the past month. Meanwhile, the Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart depicts the change in the balance of investors with between 100 and 1,000 BTC (capturing exchange-traded fund holdings). What’s more peculiar is that the Total Whale (and Dolphin) Holdings and Monthly % Change excludes exchange wallet addresses. According to Moreno, the majority of Bitcoin whale data has been skewed by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances, explaining why whales seem to be in a reaccumulation phase recently. Interestingly, the data is indeed skewed, as upon removing all exchange addresses’ data, the total Bitcoin whale balances shows a decline rather than an ascent. The same trend can be seen in the lower Total Dolphin Holdings and Monthly % Change chart in the image below. This shrinking balances of Bitcoin whales tells a story of waning demand in the market, sending signals of the start of a bear market. As seen in past cycles, the lack of apparent demand growth is the most telltale sign of impending correction phase for the Bitcoin price. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $90,320, reflecting an over 2% leap in the past 24 hours. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Suffering Historic Losses Since its trading debut, the US Bitcoin ETF market has been an excellent way to judge investor demand in the cryptocurrency market. However, market data hasn’t been telling a pretty story for the flagship cryptocurrency in recent weeks. For context, the largest Bitcoin ETF , BlackRock’s IBIT, posted roughly $244 million in net outflows last week, marking its 2nd-consecutive weekly withdrawal. The fund has now witnessed net withdrawals in 8 of the last 10 weeks, with a total of just 20 weekly outflows since its launch two years ago. According to recent data, crypto funds registered approximately $446 million in net outflows last week, marking the sixth week of withdrawal over the last nine weeks.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto|Julio Moreno,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

About 19 .8% of Argentina’s population were using digital assets in 2025, with USDT and Bitcoin being the most popular types in circulation. Why are Argentines into crypto? Argentina led Latin America in cryptocurrency adoption throughout 2025. The country’s adoption rates place it among the world’s top 20 markets. Argentines use virtual assets as protection against inflation and peso volatility, while others view them as more efficient alternatives to traditional payment systems. According to the Blockchain Argentina Foundation’s latest report, which incorporates data from major exchanges including Ripio, Decrypto, and Satoshi Tango, crypto adoption grew by 0.8% during 2025, with 19.8% of the population now using some type of cryptocurrency. This means nearly one in five Argentines has embraced digital assets as part of their finances. “Almost no one today considers having their money stagnant, without ‘working’. That’s why the use of wallets that ‘kill’ for giving a differential is growing and will continue to expand.” Analyst Rodrigo Mansilla noted . Exchanges offer attractive returns on crypto-denominated deposits that traditional banks cannot match. Mansilla explained that adoption was previously related to devaluation and the need to preserve purchasing power; today, crypto usability has significantly expanded with yields in crypto dollars and other attractive uses. The Argentine Fintech Chamber has confirmed that new users continue signing up despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions. Decrypto’s annual growth recorded close to 20% an d de tected sustained interest from a new segment: small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Which cryptocurrencies are Argentines actually using? Stablecoins are the most popular in the region and are used as tools for saving and covering inflation, plus their utility for international transfers. Up to 80% of Decrypto transactions are made using this stablecoin. Satoshi Tango presents Bitcoin as the lead adopted cryptocurrency and USDT as the second, with monthly variations depending on factors like vacations, Christmas bonuses, or elections. In Decrypto, 70% of customers ar e me n with an average age of 35 years, predominantly residing in large cities. Satoshi Tango reports 80% male and 20% female users, with ages mostly ranging from 35 to 65 years, and a strong presence in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, and Mendoza. Ripio provided granular data showing 65.47% male users and 34.51% female users, with 0.01% non-binary individuals.

Bitcoin Enters Choppy Range As Critical Trend Line Holds Below,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-enters-choppy-range/,newsbtc,"Bitcoin has entered a choppy weekend range, testing traders’ patience as price action slows and volatility compresses. Despite the sideways movement, a critical trend line just below current levels remains intact, keeping the broader market outlook cautious but far from broken. Bitcoin Drifts Into A Typical Weekend Range According to a recent update by Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin has entered a typical weekend range. Weekend trading is often characterized by low liquidity and choppy price action, which can make moves less predictable and more prone to false signals. Snyder is taking a cautious approach, waiting for a clear trigger at the boundaries of this range before committing to any trades. Related Reading: Bitcoin Key Moving Averages Indicate An Imminent Drop To $38,000 Snyder notes that the $90,930 level could present a strong shorting opportunity if a liquidity sweep occurs and the price fails to hold. On the other hand, if Bitcoin demonstrates strength and manages to break above this threshold, it could signal bullish momentum, making long positions potentially attractive for traders looking to capitalize on a breakout. Similarly, the lower boundary near $88,430 is critical. A sweep below this level followed by a quick reversal could offer long positions. However, if the support fails and the market structure breaks, it would likely trigger continuation shorts. These levels act as key decision points where traders can gauge whether momentum favors buyers or sellers in the short term. Snyder emphasizes that these setups are primarily scalp trades, with lower risk exposure. The expert only executes trades when all confirmation signals align, ensuring that a clear technical rationale backs each position. Looking ahead, external factors could add more volatility to Bitcoin’s price action. Geopolitical tensions and the return of major market participants next week are expected to increase trading volume and momentum, potentially turning these weekend range moves into larger trends. BTC Holds Key Investor Tool Model Support Around $83,900 Crypto analyst Patel recently highlighted that Bitcoin is holding a key support level known as the Investor Tool Model Support, situated around $83,900, which also coincides with the 730-day moving average. This level has historically acted as a major pivot for Bitcoin, helping to gauge the broader market trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Unusual Short-Term Supply Spike, Raising Bearish Flags According to Patel, a decisive break below this support has historically signaled the start of a confirmed bear market, while holding above it typically points to a corrective phase rather than a long-term downtrend. In other words, this level serves as a critical dividing line between temporary pullbacks and structural weakness. Currently, the $83,900 zone is a key area to watch closely. Price action around this support could determine whether Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory or risks entering a more extended bearish phase, making it a pivotal point for decision-making in the market.

56787695,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258305,1767486311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surges Past $91,000 Milestone in Stunning Rally",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-surges-past-91000/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surges Past $91,000 Milestone in Stunning Rally In a significant market development on April 2, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) has decisively broken through the $91,000 barrier, trading at $91,188.55 on the Binance USDT market according to Bitcoin World data. This surge represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, marking its highest valuation in the current market cycle and igniting discussions about its underlying drivers and potential trajectory. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $91,000 Surge The ascent past $91,000 follows a period of sustained upward momentum for Bitcoin. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors propelling this rally. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure, particularly on major exchanges like Binance. Furthermore, on-chain metrics indicate a reduction in exchange reserves, suggesting a trend toward accumulation rather than immediate selling. This price action is not occurring in isolation. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency market cap has expanded in tandem, though Bitcoin’s dominance ratio remains a key watch metric for institutional and retail investors alike. Several technical indicators aligned to support this breakout. The price convincingly moved above several key moving averages, which now act as potential support levels. Trading volume spiked notably during the ascent, providing validation for the move’s strength. Market sentiment, as gauged by various fear and greed indices, has shifted firmly into optimistic territory, though not yet at extreme levels historically associated with market tops. Historical Context and Market Drivers To understand the importance of the $91,000 level, one must consider Bitcoin’s price history. This milestone sits well above previous cycle highs, establishing a new benchmark. The journey to this point involved overcoming significant resistance zones, each representing a consolidation of seller interest. Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a crucial role. For example, evolving monetary policy, inflation data, and geopolitical stability all influence investor appetite for alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Institutional adoption provides another critical layer of context. Recent filings with regulatory bodies show increased exposure from traditional finance entities. Moreover, regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has reduced a longstanding overhang on the market. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for scaling, also contribute to its fundamental value proposition. The following table compares key Bitcoin price milestones from recent years: Date Price Milestone Notable Context Nov 2021 ~$69,000 (All-Time High) Peak of previous cycle, high institutional interest Nov 2022 ~$16,000 (Cycle Low) Post-FTX collapse, macro risk-off environment Q1 2025 >$91,000 (Current) New cycle high, matured regulatory landscape Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Market analysts emphasize the difference between speculative spikes and sustainable growth. Many point to the changed underlying infrastructure compared to previous bull markets. The investor base is now more diversified, including: Long-term holders (HODLers): Entities with multi-year investment horizons. Corporate Treasuries: Public companies adding BTC to balance sheets. Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs): Providing regulated access for a wider audience. Nation-State Entities: Some countries have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This diversity can potentially reduce volatility over time. Experts from firms like Fidelity Digital Assets and CoinShares often reference on-chain data, such as the percentage of supply that hasn’t moved in over a year, as a measure of conviction. Their analysis suggests the current rally is supported by strong fundamentals, not merely hype. However, they universally caution that cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, and past performance never guarantees future results. Potential Impacts and Future Trajectory The breach of $91,000 has immediate and longer-term implications. In the short term, it tests liquidity and can trigger algorithmic trading strategies. It also brings psychological price targets, like $100,000, into clearer view for market participants. For the broader digital asset ecosystem, a strong Bitcoin often acts as a rising tide, lifting other projects. Nevertheless, capital rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins is a dynamic that seasoned traders monitor closely. From a global finance perspective, Bitcoin’s performance challenges traditional asset correlations. Its behavior during periods of currency devaluation or equity market stress is a subject of ongoing study. Regulatory bodies worldwide are undoubtedly observing this price action as they continue to formulate frameworks for digital asset oversight. The network’s security, measured by its hash rate, typically strengthens during price rallies as mining becomes more profitable, creating a positive feedback loop for the protocol’s integrity. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $91,000 marks a definitive chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This Bitcoin price achievement reflects a complex interplay of technological adoption, macroeconomic forces, and shifting investor demographics. While the path forward will inevitably include volatility, the current milestone underscores the asset’s growing resilience and its cemented role in the global discussion about money, value, and sovereignty. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this level consolidates as a new support zone for the next phase of growth. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price reported in this surge? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring data cited on April 2, 2025, BTC was trading at $91,188.55 on the Binance USDT market when it rose above the $91,000 level. Q2: Why is breaking the $91,000 level significant for Bitcoin? Surpassing $91,000 represents a new cycle high, demonstrating strong buyer conviction and overcoming previous psychological and technical resistance levels. It establishes a new benchmark price for the asset in its current market phase. Q3: What are some common factors that drive a major Bitcoin price increase? Major rallies are often driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional adoption, favorable macroeconomic conditions (like inflation concerns), regulatory developments, technological upgrades to the network, and broader shifts in global risk sentiment. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s current price compare to its all-time high? The all-time high for Bitcoin prior to this move was approximately $69,000, reached in November 2021. The move above $91,000 therefore represents a new record high, surpassing the previous peak by a significant margin. Q5: Does a high Bitcoin price affect the rest of the cryptocurrency market? Historically, a strong Bitcoin price often has a positive effect on the broader cryptocurrency market, a phenomenon known as the “halo effect.” It can increase overall market capitalization, improve sentiment, and attract new capital into the digital asset space. However, capital sometimes rotates between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

In a post shared on X, one trader said he made $80,000 overnight using Polymarket by tracking signals tied to US military activity. The trader pointed out that the United States had moved its largest aircraft carrier earlier on, which convinced him a strike on Venezuela was coming. The only unknown was timing, so he built a simple bot to watch Domino’s pizza orders around the Pentagon, a pattern long linked to late-night government work. The trader wrote , “The moment the pizza indicator bot spotted an unusual activity, I was alerted on my phone and immediately purchased as many ‘Will the US strike Venzuela’ shares on Polymarket. GG and thanks for playing.” Early hours of the morning, Trump confirmed the strike on Truth Social, saying the United States had carried out a large-scale operation against Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow. There will be a News Conference today at 11 A.M., at Mar-a-Lago,” said Trump. B ets land before Trump confirms capture of Nicolás Maduro By the time Trump spoke , Polymarket positions were already deep in profit. A newly created Polymarket account had invested more than $30,000 on Maduro’s exit from power. After US forces took him into custody overnight, the trader walked away with about $400,000 in under 24 hours. Polymarket bets on Trump’s Venezuela strikes. Source: X/Polymarket On prediction markets, insider trading is allowed. Traders openly act on private analysis and public signals tied to geopolitical events involving Venezuela. Prediction markets have recently drawn scrutiny from regulators. Gaming commissions across the United States argue some platforms act like unlicensed sportsbooks. Sports contracts on Kalshi and Polymarket have grown quickly. Kalshi ended a long legal fight with the Commodity Futures and Exchange Commission in 2025, but that calm ended when state gaming commissions began sending cease-and-desist letters. Crypto and oil markets react as regulators circle prediction platforms Trump later said at a press conference that the United States would temporarily run Venezuela during a transition period. He said the goal was to get oil production moving again. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country,” Trump said. He added, “They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been.” Hours after Maduro’s capture, senior figures from his government condemned the military operation and warned against US involvement. Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s chosen vice president, whom Trump said was sworn in on Saturday, called the capture “barbaric” and an “illegal and illegitimate kidnapping.” She said it was an attack on the sovereignty of Venezuela and called for the “immediate release” of Maduro and his wife, saying he remained “the only president of Venezuela.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters at Mar-a-Lago and said Maduro had chances to avoid arrest. “Nicolás Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this. He was provided multiple very, very, very generous offers, and chose instead to act like a wild man.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged back above $91,000 as more than $60 million in leveraged short positions were wiped out in one hour after prices increased around $3,000 from lows seen after the US began strikes on Venezuela. Trump linked Maduro’s removal to oil supply. He said Venezuela holds roughly 300 billion barrels of oil, the largest reserves in the world, more than Saudi Arabia. “We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive, skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,” Trump said. He added that the oil embargo he imposed remains “in full effect.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|Kalshi|Polymarket|Venezuela,BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

While recent technical improvements suggest momentum is turning in favor of the bulls, key resistance levels remain overhead, which means the recovery seems promising, but not yet fully confirmed. Market Structure Remains Unconvincing Despite The Bounce In a recent market update, crypto analyst Luca expressed a cautious outlook regarding Ethereum’s current market structure. While the price has managed a technical feat by breaking above the 1D Bull Market Support Band, a zone that has historically served as a reliable reversal point over the past several months, Luca remains unconvinced of a broader trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Momentum Rolls Over, Bearish Move Warning The primary hurdle for a definitive bullish reversal lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI), currently positioned at $3,120. Luca emphasizes that Ethereum must durably reclaim this level to shift the lower-timeframe sentiment. Until this specific price target is secured as support, the risk of the current move being a fake-out remains high. Drawing parallels to the current state of Bitcoin, Luca suggests that the most prudent approach for investors is to remain defensive, as the market has yet to confirm a breakout above the Fibonacci resistance. This cautious stance is intended to guard against emotional trading during a period of high uncertainty and potential volatility. To manage this risk, Luca is maintaining a cash reserve to hedge spot holdings in case a rejection occurs. A failure to hold current levels would likely trigger a deeper pullback toward the previous high-timeframe resistance range near $2,700 before a more sustainable and durable reversal to the upside unfolds. Ethereum Opens 2026 With A Key Trend Shift According to StockTrader_max, Ethereum has started 2026 on a clearly positive technical footing. ETH has printed its first daily close above the 50-day moving average since October 9, a period that coincided with the liquidation-driven shock that rippled through the broader crypto market. This close marks a meaningful shift in trend behavior after months of trading below key short-term averages. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Presses Resistance, but Can The Recovery Survive? From a bullish perspective, reclaiming the 50-day MA is exactly the kind of confirmation sought for following an extended corrective phase. It signals improving momentum and suggests that buyers are beginning to regain control, potentially laying the groundwork for a more sustained recovery rather than a short-lived bounce. Looking ahead, StockTrader_max highlighted the 200-day moving average around $3,550 as the next major upside objective. As capital starts to rotate back into Ethereum and risk appetite improves, the analyst expects price action to gravitate toward this level in the coming sessions.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-under-2-is-a-great-blessing-heres-why/,timestabloid,"A prominent financial educator within the XRP community has described XRP’s current valuation below $2 as an exceptional long-term opportunity, framing the present market environment as favorable for strategic positioning rather than short-term concern. His remarks reflect a broader sentiment among long-term holders who believe XRP’s current price does not adequately reflect its intended role in future financial systems. Long-Term Positioning Over Short-Term Price Action Coach JV, a widely recognized finance coach and digital asset commentator, recently shared his perspective on XRP’s current market price. According to him, XRP trading below $2 represents a rare opportunity for patient investors who are focused on long-term outcomes rather than short-term volatility. He disclosed that he continues to increase his exposure at current levels, suggesting confidence that broader adoption and institutional integration have not yet been fully reflected in market pricing. XRP under $2.00 is one of the greatest blessings of our lifetime. I am still accumulating. My top crypto holdings: XRP Bitcoin WLFI Solana XLM HBAR VET My top two stocks: ABTC XXI Cash-value life insurance is the foundation of my family’s wealth empire. Cash flow is the… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 1, 2026 Rather than emphasizing daily price fluctuations, his commentary centers on delayed valuation recognition. From his viewpoint, XRP’s use case within cross-border payments and financial infrastructure positions it for future relevance, regardless of temporary market weakness. This approach contrasts with the frustration expressed by some investors who remain focused on near-term performance. Investment Strategy Anchored in Conviction Beyond his stance on XRP, Coach JV has openly discussed the structure of his broader investment portfolio. Within digital assets, his largest positions include XRP, Bitcoin, Solana, XLM, HBAR, VET, and WLFI. This allocation highlights a preference for assets tied to infrastructure development, liquidity, and long-term utility rather than speculative trends. In traditional markets, he identified American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) and Twenty One Capital (XXI) as key equity holdings. Both companies operate as crypto treasury-focused firms, reinforcing his emphasis on exposure to businesses aligned with digital asset accumulation and long-term balance sheet strategies. Collectively, these choices reflect a consistent investment thesis centered on durability and strategic alignment rather than short-term returns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Structure and Financial Discipline A recurring theme in Coach JV’s commentary is the importance of financial systems over reactive decision-making. He has repeatedly stated that long-term success depends on disciplined frameworks rather than frequent trading or emotional responses to market movements. According to him, sustainable wealth is built through predictable cash flow, controlled risk exposure, and intentional asset allocation. He has highlighted tools such as cash-value life insurance as part of his family’s long-term financial planning, alongside maintaining minimal personal debt and evaluating investments through the lens of inflation protection. This structured approach resonates with XRP supporters who view extended periods of low prices as opportunities to strengthen their positions within a broader financial plan. Broader Bullish Sentiment Within the XRP Community Coach JV’s outlook aligns with similar views expressed by other well-known XRP commentators. In recent months, Alex Cobb has also argued that XRP trading below $2 represents a significant valuation disconnect. Cobb has pointed to multiple developments that could support future price appreciation, including upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States. One frequently cited catalyst is the scheduled markup of the CLARITY Act in January 2026, which many industry participants believe could encourage increased institutional participation in crypto markets. Additionally, demand for spot XRP exchange-traded funds has continued to grow, with assets under management now totaling approximately $1.16 billion. Corporate interest in XRP treasury strategies has also increased, with firms such as VivoPower and Wellgistics Health announcing plans to hold XRP as a long-term reserve asset. Supporters argue that sustained institutional accumulation, combined with regulatory progress, could create conditions favorable for long-term price expansion. Taken together, these views reflect a shared belief that XRP’s current market value does not fully capture its long-term potential. For investors who prioritize disciplined planning and extended time horizons, XRP’s sub-$2 price is seen not as a signal of failure, but as an opportunity to build exposure ahead of broader adoption cycles.

This record has been achieved almost two years after the introduction of these crypto ETFs in January 2024. To back this claim, data from a reliable source noted that the $2 trillion achievement was reached on January 2. In comparison, analysts found that the cumulative trading volume reached an all-time high of approximately $1 trillion, recorded on May 6, 2025. This milestone was achieved about 16 months after the launch of the ETFs. Notably, the surge from $1 trillion to $2 trillion took approximately eight months. This duration is half the time consumed to attain the first trillion. Hence, the situation demonstrates a heightened interest from institutions seeking regulated investments in cryptocurrency-related assets. Crypto ETFs demonstrate outstanding net inflows US-based spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs opened 2026 with strong momentum, recording nearly $646 million in combined net inflows on the first trading day despite uneven sentiment across the wider crypto market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $471.3 million in net inflows on Friday, while spot Ether ETFs added $174.5 million, lifting total inflows to $645.8 million, according to data from Farside. The inflow marked the strongest single day for US spot Bitcoin ETFs in 35 trading sessions, the largest since Nov. 11, when the 11 funds collectively drew $524 million. Spot Ether ETFs also logged their biggest one-day inflow in 15 trading days, the highest since Dec. 9, when inflows reached $177.7 million. The current cumulative volume encompasses a broader range of assets. To further clarify this point for better understanding, they mentioned that firms introduced spot ETFs that can effectively track Solana, XRP , Dogecoin, Litecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink shortly after new generic listing standards received the green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 17, 2025. Following this approval, reports highlighted that the agency decided to reduce approval times from 240 days to 75 days. Meanwhile, among the listed new offerings, XRP-based products secured ranking among the most outperformed, generating about $1.2 billion in net inflows since they began operating on November 13. On the other hand, a review from a reliable source declared that Bitcoin ETFs experienced approximately $21.8 billion in net inflows while other ETFs encountered about $9.8 billion in net inflows. In the case of BlackRock’s IBIT , it was confirmed that the spot bitcoin ETF owns approximately 70% of the market share by volume with more than $66 billion in assets under management (AUM). This finding was noted after its volume share hit a high level of 80% in mid-2025. James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, weighed in on the situation. He acknowledged that the authorities have approved several crypto ETF filings. However, Seyffart affirmed that there are at least 126 more of these filings pending approval. Nonetheless, he warned that some may halt their operations if they fail to draw in sufficient steady investments. As the situation becomes more intense, data from SoSoValue claimed that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs showed significant outcomes at the beginning of the new year on January 2. It is worth noting that this date represented the first trading day of 2026. BlackRock’s IBIT secures the top ranking in net inflows The net inflows of Spot Bitcoin ETFs totaled approximately $471.1 million, with all twelve funds experiencing a surge in positive investments. BlackRock’s IBIT ranks first with $287.4 million. The second on the list was Fidelity’s FBTC, with approximately $88.1 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB, with about $41.5 million. As of now, the Bitcoin ETF assets amount to approximately $117.0 billion, accounting for 6.53% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at around $90,602.99, reflecting a 0.73% increase in the past 24 hours, according to reports from CoinMarketCap .

Experts Weigh In,https://timestabloid.com/where-will-xrp-go-in-2026-experts-weigh-in/,timestabloid,"As the digital asset market turns the page on a challenging 2025, discussion has intensified around where major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, could be headed in 2026. Commentary from industry figures highlighted by Digital Perspectives founder Brad Kimes has contributed to an optimistic narrative. The video Kimes shared included insights from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos, shaping expectations for 2026 . Crypto Market Closed 2025 Below Its Peak Despite beginning 2025 with strong momentum, the cryptocurrency market struggled to sustain those gains. Market capitalization reached a record level of approximately $4.27 trillion in early October, only to reverse sharply in the final quarter. By year-end, total market value had declined to about $2.93 trillion, representing a significant retreat from its peak and an overall annual loss of roughly $250 billion. This performance reflected a year-over-year decline of 7.85%. XRP- Where Will Crypto & XRP Go in 2026? – XRP Charts? (includes paid promotion) pic.twitter.com/6jPjub2Ehq — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) December 28, 2025 XRP mirrored the broader market’s downturn, finishing 2025 with a loss of almost 12%. However, early indicators in 2026 suggest a shift in sentiment , as analysts reassess the structural forces influencing digital assets and reconsider long-standing assumptions about market cycles. Bitwise CIO Questions the Traditional Crypto Cycle Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan challenged the relevance of the traditional four-year crypto cycle , arguing it no longer drives market behavior. He said the industry may now be entering a longer-term growth phase shaped by new structural forces. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hougan pointed to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory developments, and the expanding use of stablecoins and tokenization as lasting demand drivers. While cycle thinking still affects sentiment, he expects 2026 to deliver steady gains, lower volatility, and more normalized price action. Hougan also noted that institutional adoption remains slow. He stated that firms such as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and more approved Bitcoin products well after ETF launches due to lengthy internal processes. This delay helps explain the uneven market action observed over the past year. Inversion CEO Expresses Confidence in XRP’s Potential Kimes also referenced comments from Inversion CEO Santiago Roel Santos. Santos shared a notably bullish view on XRP during a recent Empire podcast episode. He argued that the asset has a credible path back to its all-time high . He believes it is more likely to do so than the other top 10 cryptos, even with weak market conditions. He contrasted this optimism with a more pessimistic outlook on Ethereum, questioning its valuation and product direction. According to Santos, Ethereum’s market capitalization lacks sufficient justification. However, XRP’s lower valuation gives Ripple greater flexibility to deploy its native asset. He emphasized Ripple’s ability to use XRP for expansion, acquisitions, and to strengthen its ecosystem over time.

56791953,652223,1767484805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56791953.jpeg,Here’s How Much BlackRock Spent Buying Bitcoin And Ethereum In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/heres-how-much-blackrock-spent-buying-bitcoin-and-ethereum-in-2025/,bitcoinist,"BlackRock pushed into digital assets massively in 2025, with on-chain data revealing just how aggressive the leading asset manager became in accumulating Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain tracking data shows that the world’s largest asset manager expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by more than $23 billion in 2025, and this is one of the biggest institutional accumulation phases seen in the year. The figures highlight a sustained commitment to Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as price action turned bearish towards the end of the year. BlackRock’s Crypto Portfolio Expansion Through 2025 Crypto was at the forefront of BlackRock’s investment strategy in 2025. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock’s on-chain cryptocurrency holdings at the start of 2025 were $54.83 billion. By January 1, 2026, that figure had risen to about $78.36 billion, representing a net increase of roughly $23.52 billion over the course of the year. These figures mean that by the end of 2025, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio had grown by about 43% compared to the start of the year. Unsurprisingly, the accumulation was concentrated almost entirely in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest assets leading institutional exposure to the crypto industry. Bitcoin was the dominant holding by value. BlackRock’s BTC stash grew from around 552,550 BTC worth about $51.16 billion in January 2025 to about 770,290 BTC valued at $68.05 billion in January 2026. This translates to an increase of approximately 217,740 BTC, adding about $16.88 billion to the firm’s portfolio based on year-end valuations. Even with Bitcoin’s price down about 5% from January 2025, the increase in BTC units held grew by 39%, which, in turn, pushed the total value higher. Ethereum, although smaller in absolute terms, saw even faster relative growth. Holdings expanded from 1.07 million ETH valued at $3.59 billion in January 2025 to about 3.47 million ETH worth $10.31 billion in January 2026. That represents an increase of nearly 2.4 million ETH, contributing around $6.71 billion to BlackRock’s crypto holdings in 2025. These numbers mean that BlackRock’s ETH holdings grew by more than 224% over the year, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 39% increase. ETFs And Institutional Demand Motivated $23 Billion Accumulation The bulk of BlackRock’s crypto buying in 2025 was due to persistent inflows into its spot exchange-traded products. Investor demand for regulated exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum was strong for much of the year, particularly during rallies that pushed both assets toward fresh all-time highs. At the same time, corrective phases in the crypto market were accompanied by notable ETF outflows. This trend supports the view that Bitcoin and Ethereum price action is becoming increasingly linked to ETF activity, and BlackRock is the dominant issuer within those flows. BlackRock has not yet established a presence in the XRP market. The asset manager does not currently offer a Spot XRP ETF, and spokespersons have previously stated that the company has no immediate plans to launch one.

Vitalik compared Ethereum’s situation to peer-to-peer networks that came long before it, like “BitTorrent (2000): huge total bandwidth, highly decentralized, no consensus.” Ethereum starts large gas limit increases in 2026 through BALs and ePBS Vitalik then pointed to Bitcoin in 2009, saying:- “Bitcoin (2009): highly decentralized, consensus, but low bandwidth because it’s not “distributed” in the sense of work being split up, it’s replicated. Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and high bandwidth. But now it’s time to talk about what this combination means for Ethereum.” Vitalik said these upgrades are already running code, not theory. Data availability sampling is active on mainnet today. zk-EVMs already hit production performance levels. Safety checks are the final step, and Vitalik traced that work back ten years, starting with his first data availability research commit and later zk-EVM experiments that began around 2020. The rollout plan is staged. In 2026, Ethereum expects large gas limit increases that do not depend on zk-EVMs, driven by BALs and ePBS. That same year should also bring the first chances to run a zk-EVM node on parts of the network, according to Vitalik. From 2027 through 2030, Ethereum plans even larger gas limit jumps as zk-EVMs become the main block validation method. “ZKEVM becomes the primary way to validate blocks on the network,” Vitalik wrote. Another piece is distributed block building. Vitalik said the long-term goal is a setup where a full block is never built in one place. He said this is not urgent, but worth building toward. In Vitalik’s words:- “Even before that point, we want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed as possible. This can be done either in-protocol (eg. maybe we figure out how to expand FOCIL to make it a primary channel for txs), or out-of-protocol with distributed builder marketplaces. This reduces risk of centralized interference with real-time transaction inclusion.” Vitalik said that it also improves geographic fairness. The Ethereum Foundation has it stated on its website that higher gas limits on Ethereum are made safe by zk-EVMs increase capacity, cut congestion, and stabilize fees. The Foundation said :- “Bringing zkEVMs to L1 is a multi-faceted effort. Our work is organized into three core workstreams, with parallel progress on client implementations.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Bitcoin remains above $91,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens rose to over $3.11 trillion. This article highlights some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Ethena (ENA), Jito (JTO), Pump (PUMP), and Pi Network (PI). Ethena to unlock millions of tokens Ethena, a cryptocurrency valued at over $1.8 billion, will be one of the top coins to watch this week. It will unlock 171 million tokens, currently valued at over $41 million on Sunday. This unlock comes as the unlock progress stands at 51.9%. Ethena token has rebounded in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.1935 in December to the current $0.2400. It still remains about 72% below the highest point in 2025, a decline that mirrors that of other cryptocurrencies . ENA has seen intense buying by Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMex, who has accumulated tokens worth over $3.8 million even as the total value locked has slumped to $6.4 billion from last year’s high of $14.3 billion. Jito token in focus ahead of a big token unlock Jito, a major player in the Solana ecosystem, is another top crypto to watch this week as it unlocks 11.3 million tokens worth over $5.39 million, which is equivalent with 1.14% of its market cap. Like Ethena, Jito has a long way to go in terms of its token unlocks as it has unlocked just 37.28% of its tokens. Jito’s TVL, which is made up of staked Solana tokens, has dropped from last year’s high of $3.37 billion to the current $1.9 billion. Other cryptocurrencies with large unlocks this week are Movement (MOVE), Rain (RAIN), Linea (LINEA), Pump, and Gods Unchained. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum price has rebounded in the past few days, moving to a high of $3,150, its highest level since December 12. It has jumped by 20% from its lowest level in November last year. The token will be in the spotlight this week as investors watch the ongoing trends in the ETF market. Spot Ethereum ETFs added over $160 million in inflows last week, a big improvement from the previous week’s outflows of $102 million. They had shed over $643 million in assets a week earlier. Spot Ethereum ETFs now hold over $19 billion in assets, which are equivalent to 5% of its market capitalization. Ethereum price will also be in focus as BitMine continues to invest and stake it. The company has now accumulated tokens worth over $12 billion and has started staking them. It will also announce its financial results on Friday. Pi Network (PI) Chart shows that Pi Network price moved above the upper side of the falling wedge Pi Network token has held steady in the past few days. It has remained at the key support at $0.200, its highest level since December 20th. The main reason it will be in the spotlight is that, as the chart above shows, it has moved slightly above the upper side of the falling wedge pattern. As such, there is a likelihood that this could lead to more upside in the near term. Pi Network will unlock over 36 million tokens worth over $7. 2 million as part of its daily tokens. Also, traders will likely watch the developments on the ongoing DEX and AMM testnet.

Given the consequences of the attack and the fact that Trump said the US will run the Venezuela oil industry for now, analysts expect further volatility on Sunday at 6 PM ET when the oil futures open in some markets. The Kobeissi Letter explained that Venezuela has over 300 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which will reportedly be under US control. With oil prices at $57 per barrel, this would put the country’s total reserves at $17.3 trillion. The analysts added that even if the US sells this oil for half the market rate, the value of $8.7 trillion would be larger than the GDP of all countries except China and the US. Consequently, they noted that “most people do not realize how much the world just changed,” and warned that more volatility is expected once financial markets, especially oil, open for trading. This is absolutely insane: Venezuela currently has 303 billion barrels of crude oil reserves, which Trump says the US now controls.

Key Takeaways: Hut 8 expanded its Coinbase credit line to $200M to support its AI and HPC push. A $7B Fluidstack deal makes Hut 8 a long-term power supplier for AI data centers. Strong stock gains and a large BTC treasury set Hut 8 apart from struggling miners. The amended facility, disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, will be used for “general corporate purposes.” T he expansion builds on Hut 8’s strong momentum through 2025, a period when many Bitcoin miners struggled with compressed margins and rising costs. Hut 8’s $7B AI Deal With Fluidstack Powers Major Data Center Push The credit increase follows a landmark $7 billion agreement signed in December with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. Under the deal, Hut 8 will supply 245 megawatts of energy over 15 years to power a large-scale AI data center, marking one of the largest partnerships between a crypto-native firm and an AI infrastructure company. Hut 8’s strategic pivot has been rewarded by markets. The company’s shares have risen more than 134% over the past year and are trading around $51, according to Yahoo Finance. The rally sets Hut 8 apart from much of the mining sector, which has faced sustained pressure since the April 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Beyond AI, Hut 8 has continued to expand its Bitcoin mining and treasury strategy. Through its majority ownership of American Bitcoin, a mining and crypto treasury company, the firm has increased exposure to Bitcoin at a time when many peers have been forced to sell holdings to cover operating costs. JUST IN: #Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 just announced it partnered with Google for financial backing on a 15-year lease. Bullish pic.twitter.com/NQN9JmW0ob — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2025 Industry-wide challenges have included higher energy prices and macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as rising equipment costs linked to US tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump. The measures have heightened concerns over supply chains, particularly given China’s role as a major producer of application-specific integrated circuits used in Bitcoin mining. Despite those headwinds, Hut 8 remains one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The company ranks ninth among Bitcoin treasury firms, with 13,696 BTC worth more than $1.2 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.Net. American Bitcoin ranks twentieth, holding 5,098 BTC valued at roughly $458 million. Bitmain Slashes Bitcoin Miner Prices as Industry Pressure Mounts As reported, Bitmain is cutting prices aggressively across multiple generations of Bitcoin mining hardware as pressure builds across the mining sector, according to recent promotional campaigns and internal price lists circulated to customers. One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines. Shipments for that batch are scheduled to begin in January 2026, suggesting Bitmain is willing to lock in low pricing well ahead of delivery. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hashrate fell 4% in the month through Dec. 15, a development that could set the stage for stronger price performance in the months ahead, according to analysts at VanEck. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote.

After blaming the country’s officials for certain drug operations, the US military bombed its capital, Caracas, and arrested its leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife. In his first interview and address to the nation after the attacks, US President Donald Trump claimed that his country will now run the oil industry in Venezuela, which reportedly has over 300 billion barrels of oil, valued at more than $17 trillion at market prices. One of the statements he made caused even more controversy as he claimed that he didn’t tell Congress about the military operation, as it would have leaked. The democrats used this opportunity to criticize Trump’s actions, including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, who called the attacks “reckless.” He also warned that any plan for the US to run Venezuela should “strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.” He added that the Trump administration had denied pursuing regime change or military action, which was evidently not the case. Some reports indicated later that the Trump impeachment odds reached a new all-time high on prediction platforms such as Kalshi. However, a closer look at the charts today actually shows a different story. The odds on both Kalshi and Polymarket have declined slightly since the start of the year on almost all scales (by June 1, 2026, January 1, 2027, and January 1, 2028). The chances for an impeachment by December 31, 2026, on Polymarket have declined by 3% since the attacks took place. Trump Impeachment Odds on Polymarket Interestingly, the attacks against Venezuela have impacted the two largest cryptocurrencies linked to the US President. Aside from BTC jumping past $91,000 for the first time since mid-December, WLFI has skyrocketed by more than 16% on a daily scale to almost $0.18. TRUMP has returned to the top 100 alts, soaring 7.5% to $5.40.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin held near $90K despite a major US–Venezuela military escalation that dominated headlines. BTC staying above its 21-day moving average signals short-term support and potential January upside. Analysts warn volatility could rise once institutional traders return when US markets reopen. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000 in early trading before recovering, showing limited reaction to an event that dominated global headlines. “The US bombed a country and captured its leader, on a weekend no less, and yet Bitcoin has barely moved,” said Nic Puckrin , founder of crypto media firm Coin Bureau, in a post on X. Bitcoin’s Calm Amid Geopolitical Shock Puts Focus on Key Support Level The muted response stood out in a market where risk assets often see sharp sell-offs during geopolitical crises. From a technical perspective, analysts point to encouraging signals. Michaël van de Poppe noted that Bitcoin remains above its 21-day moving average, a level often viewed as short-term support. Holding above that threshold could open the door to further price gains in January, assuming broader market conditions remain stable. The resilience is notable given Bitcoin’s recent volatility. Historically, sudden geopolitical shocks or macroeconomic stress have triggered abrupt drawdowns in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. This time, the response has been restrained, at least so far. The situation stems from an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who confirmed airstrikes on Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. While the news sparked intense debate online, financial markets appeared largely unfazed over the weekend. Some analysts caution that the calm may not last. “There’s a lot of geopolitical tension, and next week the big players will return,” said crypto trader Lennaert Snyder, warning that volatility could increase once traditional markets reopen. Institutional investors typically sit out weekends, meaning reactions may still come when US markets open on Monday. $BTC has entered the weekend range. We all know weekend ranges are choppy and slow, so I'm waiting until I get a trigger at the boundaries. The ~$90,930 high is interesting for shorts after confirmation if we get the liquidity sweep. If we show strength and gain it, longs could… pic.twitter.com/KuTLDgk8uK — Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder) January 3, 2026 Any renewed selling pressure would add to Bitcoin’s recent corrective phase. After a flash crash in October, Bitcoin fell more than 30% from an all-time high above $125,000 to around $80,000 in November, before rebounding toward current levels. Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions. Barhydt said the US central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/why-1-6-billion-xrp-just-vanished-from-exchanges-heres-what-happened/,timestabloid,"BullRunners founder Nick Anderson drew attention to a significant shift in XRP market dynamics, highlighting that approximately 1.6 billion XRP have effectively disappeared from cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Anderson, exchange-held XRP balances have fallen to levels not seen in seven years, dropping sharply from roughly 3.76 billion tokens recorded in October 2025 to around 1.6 billion currently. This contraction in readily available supply, he explained, alters the balance between liquidity and potential sell pressure and warrants closer examination as the market moves into 2026. BREAKING!! Why 1.6 Billion #XRP Just Vanished From Exchanges!? pic.twitter.com/qCL9hS9A27 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) January 2, 2026 Broader Market Context and Near-Term Structure Anderson first placed XRP within the wider digital asset landscape, noting that Bitcoin remains near the lower end of its recent trading range. While Bitcoin has shown signs of attempting a recovery toward the $90,000 area, Anderson emphasized that confirmation above key resistance levels would be necessary before a broader market rebound could be expected. Within this environment, he suggested that XRP appears to have completed its short-term downward phase, forming higher lows that could support a recovery toward previous local price levels if momentum continues. He also observed that overall crypto market capitalization has hovered around the $3 trillion mark, reflecting limited volatility during the holiday period. Despite short-term uncertainty, Anderson expressed the view that 2026 could be a constructive year for the sector, even if early market structure adjustments produce temporary weakness. Escrow Unlocks and Supply Dynamics Addressing concerns around Ripple’s scheduled escrow releases, Anderson described the January unlock of one billion XRP as a routine event rather than a market shock. He reiterated that such releases occur monthly and that a substantial portion, typically between 70 and 80%, is historically returned to escrow. In his assessment, price behavior following recent unlocks suggests that these events have not exerted meaningful downward pressure. Instead, Anderson argued that the more relevant development is the sustained reduction in exchange reserves. He noted that XRP held on exchanges has declined by more than half over the past three months, tightening available supply. If demand remains steady or increases under these conditions, he suggested that upward price pressure becomes more likely. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Activity and Forward Outlook Anderson further pointed to institutional factors supporting XRP, including continued inflows into XRP-focused exchange-traded products and growing interest in Ripple as a company. He referenced significant financing activity involving major financial players and emphasized that institutional stakeholders have a clear incentive to see long-term value appreciation. While cautioning against extreme price predictions, Anderson stressed that adoption trends, regulatory progress, and diminishing exchange supply are tangible indicators worth monitoring. In his view, these elements collectively suggest that XRP is positioned to benefit from institutional growth and evolving market infrastructure in 2026, even as short-term volatility remains part of the landscape.

56802467,https://invezz.com/?p=3019389,1767517200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,LATAM crypto news: Bitcoin travel expands in El Salvador as seniors lead digital wallet adoption in Argentina,https://invezz.com/news/2026/01/04/latam-crypto-news-bitcoin-travel-expands-in-el-salvador-as-seniors-lead-digital-wallet-adoption-in-argentina/,invezz,"This week’s most relevant crypto stories in Latin America highlight how digital assets are moving from speculation to everyday use. On one hand, Bitcoin-powered travel is gaining ground in El Salvador with the expansion of Airbtc, a booking platform built exclusively for BTC users and already showing strong local adoption. On the other hand, Argentina’s older adults are leading the region’s growth in digital wallet usage, proving that crypto and fintech adoption are accelerating across generations. Furthermore, Bitget Wallet ended 2025 with increased on-chain activity in trading, payments, and yield products, demonstrating that self-custodial wallets are becoming mainstream financial instruments rather than niche solutions for cryptocurrency traders. Together, these developments underscore a clear trend: crypto in LATAM is increasingly about real-world utility, inclusion, and economic transformation. Airbtc is a Bitcoin-only platform that is redefining travel Airbtc is a global booking platform where consumers can only pay with Bitcoin (BTC). The business, which launched in August 2024, operates similarly to Airbnb but is developed by and for bitcoiners. According to cofounder Jake Seifert, the platform already features properties across more than a dozen countries, with a strong presence in El Salvador. Destinations include El Zonte, San Salvador, Santa Ana, Berlín, Costa del Sol, and Punta Mango. Airbtc intends to improve the circular Bitcoin economy by making it easier for visitors to spend BTC in real-world circumstances. Airbtc presents itself as a decentralised alternative to existing booking platforms by eliminating financial intermediaries and charging lower prices. Guests can save up to 8%, and hosts can save up to 18% compared to services like Airbnb or Booking.com. Payments are held in cold storage until the stay is complete, after which they are released to hosts in BTC, either on-chain or over the Lightning Network. El Salvador accounts for around 15% of Airbtc’s global inventory, making it one of the biggest concentrations by nation, showing increased local interest in taking Bitcoin and the country’s favourable legislative climate for Bitcoin-focused enterprises. Seniors drive digital wallet adoption in Argentina Today, 3.3 million Argentinians over the age of 60, or 42% of the population, use a virtual wallet to access digital payments, transfers, and basic savings features. The data was published by the Argentine Fintech Chamber on December 29, citing Central Bank records that show retirees had the highest increase in digital payments and transfers over the previous year. While overall virtual wallet ownership increased by 13% between June 2024 and June 2025, use among those over 60 increased by 29.7%, more than doubling the norm. This growth suggests a deliberate transition rather than a gradual adoption. Older folks are increasingly using digital wallets for better convenience, security, and access to yields, reducing their need for currency. According to Invecq, seniors who use virtual wallets make up to 80% fewer cash withdrawals than those who just use bank accounts, contributing to a general decrease in cash usage across the economy. Beyond payments, wallets have become an important savings tool: 42% of retirees transfer funds to earn returns, and many advocate for the ability to collect and manage pensions in an increasingly digitised financial system. Bitget Wallet sees 2025 on-chain activity signal shift toward everyday crypto finance Bitget Wallet finished 2025 with increased on-chain activity in trading , payments, and yield products, indicating that self-custodial wallets are becoming mainstream financial instruments rather than specialist goods for crypto traders. The data show a gradual shift in user behaviour as adoption expanded beyond early, trading-focused audiences and into more ordinary financial use. The findings are based on internal data described in a press release sent to Invezz , which shows how wallet usage continued to rise even as broader crypto market activity slowed near the end of the year. The pattern indicates a gradual decoupling between market sentiment and real-world cryptocurrency usage, notably in areas related to payments and stablecoin-based activity. Trading activity on the blockchain increased significantly throughout 2025. Bitget Wallet’s monthly swap trading volume surpassed $900 million, representing a 232% increase over the previous year. Users increasingly depended on decentralised exchange routing to gain access to a wider range of assets across various blockchains, demonstrating a rising demand for on-chain liquidity and execution.

Meanwhile, a longer term channel chart still shows Bitcoin holding its multi year uptrend into early 2026. Bitcoin rebounds from New Year dip as Venezuela headlines hit risk appetite Bitcoin climbed back above $91,000 by Jan. 4 after a sharp New Year pullback pushed prices into the $87,000 area on the Bitstamp 1 hour chart. Price later held near $91,243 at the Jan. 4, 08:03 UTC snapshot, after topping out just under $92,000 and then moving sideways. Bitcoin U.S. Dollar 1 Hour Price Chart: Source: CoinCodex First, Bitcoin traded choppy into Dec. 31, then it sold off into the turn of the year. However, buyers stepped in quickly, and the market began building higher lows through Jan. 1 and Jan. 2. As a result, the chart shows a steady grind higher that carried Bitcoin back through $89,000 and $90,000. Then, volatility spiked around Jan. 2 and Jan. 3, with wider candles and heavier bursts of volume. This swing lined up with broader risk off behavior after headlines tied to a U.S. attack involving Venezuela. Still, Bitcoin stabilized after the initial drop, and it resumed its climb into Jan. 4, when it pushed into the low $91,000s and paused near resistance. Bitcoin holds long term rising channel as price trends toward upper range Bitcoin continues to trade inside a multi year rising channel that has guided price action since the 2018 cycle, according to a long term BTCUSD index chart shared by Trending Bitcoin on X. The chart shows Bitcoin rebounding from the lower boundary of the channel near the mid $80,000 area and then resuming its broader upward structure into early 2026. Bitcoin U.S. Dollar 1 Day Index Long Term Rising Channel Chart. Source: Trending Bitcoin on X (AO btc analyst) First, the chart highlights repeated reactions along the channel’s lower trendline across multiple market cycles. Each major drawdown since 2019 found support near that rising base before price rotated higher. This pattern repeated again in late 2025, when Bitcoin briefly slipped toward the lower channel range before stabilizing and turning upward. Then, Bitcoin pushed back above the mid channel zone, where price had previously consolidated during earlier expansion phases. That region acted as a pivot area rather than a reversal point, as buyers defended pullbacks and prevented deeper breakdowns. As a result, the structure remained intact despite short term volatility. Finally, the chart projects Bitcoin trending toward the upper boundary of the channel over the longer horizon. While the blue projection extends well beyond current price levels, the key takeaway remains the same. Bitcoin continues to respect the rising channel that has defined its long term market structure, keeping the broader trend intact as of early 2026.",News|Bitcoin,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Before implementing this move, it had alerted its users of this intention in a statement published on December 31, 2025. Notably, the firm adopted this decision the same year it received approval to begin its operations in the country. This sudden decision prompted reporters to contact the firm’s representatives for comment. The spokespersons claimed that they had embraced this move after conducting a review of their performance in the local markets. They added that, “This is a thoughtful pause that allows us to rethink and improve our strategy so we can come back with a stronger and more sustainable product.” Coinbase decides to halt its operation in Argentina In Argentina, Coinbase focused on key aspects of its regional plans in 2024, developing strategies to enter the market effectively. In January 2025, the company officially announced the launch of its local operations. Following the current situation, several individuals raised concerns about Coinbase’s sudden decision, with the main question raised in the ecosystem being, “What does this current pause mean?” In an attempt to answer this question, Coinbase released a statement intended for its users in Argentina. The statement noted that users in the country will no longer be able to access the exchange to purchase or sell the stablecoin USDC using Argentine pesos, the local currency, beginning January 31, 2026. However, it did not disclose the reason behind this decision. Another thing that the exchange unveiled was that cryptocurrency transactions, such as sending and receiving, will still be accessible to users. To silence the controversy raised in the ecosystem, Coinbase informed the press that it still values Argentina as a crucial market for new ideas. Following this claim, the firm made it clear its intentions to revive its operations in the nation in the future with an enhanced user experience. The Coinbase team asserted that they seek to achieve their firm’s goal of improving economic freedom by linking the world through blockchain technology. With this goal in mind, Latin America remains a key area of focus. As discussions continued among individuals, several analysts weighed in on the situation. They pointed out that although Coinbase adopted this move, the decision comes at a time when Argentina has solidified its position as a hub for cryptocurrencies. To support this claim, reports indicate that both local and global firms have recently shown a heightened interest in the Argentine market. For instance, Ripio launched the local peso-pegged stablecoin. Nexo, on the other hand, acquired the Buenbit exchange as part of its long-standing aim to expand. An unexpected power outage in Argentina raises concerns among individuals Apart from Coinbase, reports revealed that Bitfarms , a popular Bitcoin mining firm, also halted its Bitcoin mining operations in Argentina, based in Rio Cuarto. The company alleged that the reason behind this decision was an unexpected power outage from its local energy supplier. This information was published in Bitfarms’ earnings report for the first quarter. In this report, the firm noted that the power supply interruption began on May 12. It resulted from Generación Mediterránea S.A. (GMSA), the company responsible for providing this electricity supply to Bitfarms in Argentina. The outage occurred shortly after GMSA notified Bitfarms regarding matters related to a financial reorganization process with creditors. At this particular moment, sources highlighted that the team initially vowed to continue offering power supply to the mining company. Meanwhile, Bitfarms argued that this interruption has caused growing uncertainties concerning when or if power will be restored. Due to these uncertainties, the firm began exploring various alternatives to support operations at the facility. It is worth noting that Bitfarms’ operations in Argentina generated approximately $6.9 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2025. This figure contributed approximately 10% of the firm’s total revenue, which amounted to $66.8 million during this period. In their report, Bitfarms stated that this outage incident left them with no other choice but to halt their cryptocurrency mining operations based in Argentina. After making this claim, the company warned that this situation could significantly impact their operations if not resolved.

Many larger-cap altcoins have posted even more impressive gains daily, including ETH, which has reclaimed the $3,100 resistance, and XRP, which is close to $2.10. BTC Eyes $92K After closing 2025 as the first post-halving year in the red, bitcoin began 2026 on the right foot and quickly surged from $88,000 to almost $91,000 on Friday. It faced an immediate rejection there on Saturday morning when reports about explosions in Venezuela’s capital went live and slipped to $89,300. Interestingly, BTC started to regain traction once the US confirmed it carried out a successful military mission in Venezuela and captured its president. Hours later, after Trump addressed the nation, bitcoin climbed even further and neared $92,000 earlier this morning for the first time since mid-December. It was stopped there, but still trades above $91,000, which represents a 4.2% weekly increase. For now, its market capitalization has surged to $1.825 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins has declined in the past week, though, from 57.7% to 56.9% on CoinGecko. BTCUSD Jan 4.

A convergence of corporate moves, institutional accumulation, regulatory developments, and shifting market structure has thrust Bitcoin back into the spotlight, reaffirming its role as the bellwether of the digital asset market. Several major developments are driving the surge in Bitcoin chatter. Bitfarms’ decision to sell a Paraguay mining site for up to $30 million highlights strategic capital reallocation as miners adapt to post-halving economics and rising cost pressures. Meanwhile, Tether has become the fifth-largest Bitcoin holder, amassing roughly $8.42 billion in BTC, underscoring growing institutional-scale confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. Regulatory and market infrastructure shifts are further fueling Bitcoin’s momentum. South Korea’s largest crypto exchange is reportedly laying the groundwork for Bitcoin ETFs, even as regulatory approvals lag, underscoring mounting global pressure to fold Bitcoin into mainstream financial products. In the U.S., spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $348 million toward the end of 2025. While seemingly bearish, analysts view these flows as routine portfolio rebalancing rather than a weakening of long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Price action and trading dynamics are further fueling the hype. Bitcoin has seen sharp intraday swings, surging trading volumes, and heightened options activity, especially around major contract expiries that tend to amplify short-term volatility. With BTC trading near $91,428, market momentum remains firmly in focus. On X, formerly Twitter, discourse is dominated by Bitcoin’s recent performance, increasingly bullish 2026 outlooks, narratives of institutional accumulation, and comparisons with traditional assets like gold and equities, reinforcing an overall strongly bullish market sentiment. Beyond Bitcoin, several altcoins are capturing market attention. PEPE (PEPE) is surging with volatile price swings and skyrocketing trading volumes typical of meme-driven tokens. Ethereum (ETH) hovers near $3,000, buoyed by institutional inflows, active smart contract deployment, and strong network activity. Dogecoin (DOGE) dominates social chatter, with debates over its market performance and long-term potential. Solana (SOL) trends on discussions of staking, ecosystem growth, and its role as a high-performance blockchain. Conclusion Bitcoin top weekend discussions, driven by major institutional moves, regulatory shifts, and heightened volatility, while the broader crypto market balances speculation with innovation. Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, PEPE, and Dogecoin attract attention through network activity and social momentum, but Bitcoin remains the key market barometer. This weekend’s trends suggest that, despite short-term swings, strong investor interest and strategic positioning could set the stage for a bullish start to 2026, highlighting both opportunities and risks in an interconnected crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

In this context, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of a significant price move as it continues to compress within a well-defined symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart, a structure that often precedes sharp volatility. According to market analysis highlighted by Ali Martinez in an X post on January 4, the ongoing consolidation points to a potential breakout of around 15%, bringing a decisive move into focus for traders and investors. The outlook indicates that the asset is trading within a tightening range, reflecting declining volatility and growing market indecision, conditions that typically resolve with a strong directional move once the price breaks out. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ali Martinez The upper resistance trendline currently caps price action just below the $91,000–$92,000 zone, while rising support has held above the $86,800 area. A confirmed breakout above the descending resistance would imply a measured move of roughly 15%, placing Bitcoin near or above the psychologically important $100,000 level. Such a move would likely be reinforced by momentum traders re-entering the market after the prolonged consolidation period. Conversely, a breakdown below the ascending support would open the door to a corrective move toward the low $80,000s, though current price action favors an upside test. Bitcoin moves past $90,000 It is worth noting that Bitcoin rallied above the $91,000 mark on Sunday as risk appetite improved across the broader cryptocurrency market , extending the early 2026 rebound in major digital assets. The advance was fueled in part by a sharp liquidation event that flushed out crowded positions and reset near-term leverage. Roughly $180 million in futures positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with short positions accounting for about $133 million. This imbalance suggests many traders were positioned against the move, triggering forced buybacks as prices climbed. Geopolitical developments also contributed to the rally. Fast-moving headlines out of Venezuela added to market volatility and encouraged risk-taking, reinforcing the upward push in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $91,460, up about 2% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly basis, BTC is up more than 4%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As things stand, Bitcoin is trading above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ), with the price around $91,555 compared with the 50-day SMA near $90,018, indicating that short- to medium-term momentum remains constructive. However, the price remains well below the 200-day SMA at roughly $99,664, suggesting the broader trend has yet to fully turn bullish and that overhead resistance remains significant. The 14-day RSI stands at 56.48, placing Bitcoin in neutral territory. This reading reflects modest upside momentum without signs of overbought conditions, implying room for further gains if buying pressure strengthens, though not yet enough conviction to signal a strong trend continuation.

According to news sources, the woman secretly swapped a cryptocurrency wallet during a business meeting in Dubai, defrauding an investor of digital assets worth about $1 million. Court records revealed that the woman carried out the act discreetly while the meeting was ongoing in order not to arouse suspicion. It claimed that she secretly replaced a hardware wallet containing private key information with another identical device that she had prepared before attending the meeting. The crypto wallet swap enabled the digital assets contained in the wallet to be transferred to another wallet without the knowledge of the owner. Dubai court jails woman for crypto wallet theft According to reports, the incident occurred after the victim was introduced to a man who claimed to own an investment company and expressed interest in financing a business project. After protracted investment discussions, the man asked the investor to show proof of financial capability before finalizing agreements. This meant that the man asked the investor to demonstrate if he had the needed funds to complete the business project, noting that the investor had to show a substantial amount in crypto. A verification meeting was agreed to by both parties, and it was arranged in Dubai to complete the process. The man failed to attend the meeting, noting that something urgent came up at the last minute. However, he assured the investor that his wife would attend the meeting and oversee everything he needed to on his behalf. According to investigators, the woman attended the meeting in Dubai, and while handling the verification procedure, swapped the genuine wallet and replaced it with a similar-looking device. The investor discovered later that his digital assets had been transferred to another party and reported it to the police. The authorities kick-started their criminal investigation and referred the case to the Dubai Misdemeanours and Infractions Court after its finalization. The court convicted the woman of theft and sentenced her to two months in prison. In addition, she was also asked to pay a fine worth the value of the stolen assets at the time of the offense. Finally, the court also ordered her deportation from the UAE. The court orders $1 million in compensation to the victim The woman took the case to the Dubai Court of Appeals, which upheld the initial criminal ruling. Following the criminal judgment, the investor filed a civil lawsuit seeking compensation for financial losses and profits lost to the theft. He argued that the value of the stolen digital asset had increased after the woman stole his assets. The civil court ruled in his favor and ordered the defendant to pay Dh. 4.3 million ($1,170,768) in compensation. In addition, she was ordered to pay 5% annual legal interest until a full repayment is made. The court mentioned that digital assets are recognized as financial properties under the law and are protected. The woman’s husband, who was identified as a key participant in the scheme, has since absconded and remains at large. The case highlights growing legal recognition of digital assets in the UAE, as well as the serious consequences of fraud involving digital assets . Meanwhile, analysts have called on crypto holders to store their digital assets using the best techniques. The call came after Chainalysis released a report mentioning that the UAE was responsible for the highest crypto loss per person. The report mentioned that each victim of crypto theft in the UAE has lost approximately Dh. 293, 600 ($80,00). In addition, they also advised traders to strengthen their passwords, implement two-factor authentication, and be wary of phishing scams . The report mentioned that victims in the US came second, followed by victims in Chile, India, Lithuania, Japan, Israel, Norway, and Germany.

That new milestone was reached as some in the cryptocurrency community observed Genesis Day, the anniversary of Bitcoin’s first block. Reports note the timing drew attention because it highlighted contrasts between public borrowing and Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Debt Hits New High According to Treasury figures , the gross federal debt climbed past $38 trillion on January 3. The rise has been sharp over the last two years, moving from about $34 trillion in early 2024 to roughly $36 trillion by late 2024, and then at $38.5 trillion in late 2025. Analysts have calculated that the debt has been increasing by roughly $6 billion per day recently, a pace that pushes interest costs higher and narrows options for future budgets. Some of the increase comes from continuing budget shortfalls where spending outstrips revenue. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network launched with the mining of its first block, known as the Genesis Block. Embedded in that block was a headline from @TheTimes newspaper: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The message permanently anchors Bitcoin’s origin… pic.twitter.com/hGozJOYd3I — Bitcoin Policy UK (@bitcoinpolicyuk) January 3, 2026 Drivers Behind The Surge According to market coverage , several factors are behind the jump: sustained annual deficits, increasing interest payments on existing debt, and large spending bills enacted in recent sessions of Congress. Debt held by the public and amounts owed to federal trust funds together make up the headline figure. Economists warn that as the debt grows relative to the size of the economy, more taxpayer dollars will be needed just to service interest payments, which could crowd out other priorities. Bitcoin Community Responds On January 3, many Bitcoin supporters marked Genesis Day, a date they view as symbolic of financial change when Bitcoin’s first block was mined in 2009. Some users posted about the contrast between a national debt that keeps climbing and Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins. Others used the anniversary to elevate broader questions about fiscal rules and money supply. The reactions were mixed; some view it as a warning, others saw it as a moment for commemoration. Investors and commentators have weighed the implications. A portion of the market treats scarce assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against what they view as the risks of heavy borrowing. At the same time, mainstream economists caution that running large and persistent deficits can raise borrowing costs and slow growth over the long run. Treasury officials monitor cash needs closely and sometimes change borrowing schedules to cover gaps between receipts and outlays.

The move reflects a broader reassessment of where mining companies deploy capital as they balance volatile crypto prices with rising energy and infrastructure demands. By monetising assets in South America, Bitfarms is bringing forward cash flows that were previously expected years down the line. The proceeds are set to be redirected into new energy infrastructure tied to high-performance computing and artificial intelligence in North America, a segment the company sees as offering stronger long-term returns. Paraguay site sale The company has agreed to sell its Paso Pe facility in Paraguay to the Sympatheia Power Fund, managed by Singapore-based Hawksburn Capital. The transaction values the site at up to $30 million and is subject to customary closing conditions. Bitfarms expects the deal to close within the next 60 days. Under the terms, Bitfarms will receive $9 million upfront. The remaining consideration of up to $21 million will be paid over the following 10 months, depending on the achievement of specific payment milestones. This structure allows the company to secure immediate liquidity while retaining exposure to near-term value from the asset. Capital redeployment Rather than reinvesting in additional mining capacity in Latin America, Bitfarms plans to channel the proceeds into North American energy infrastructure linked to HPC and AI workloads. Management has indicated that this approach effectively accelerates two to three years of anticipated free cash flows from operations. Those funds are expected to be redeployed during 2026, aligning with the company’s broader push to diversify beyond traditional bitcoin mining. The strategy highlights a growing trend among listed miners to explore adjacent computing markets that can offer steadier revenue streams. By reallocating capital, Bitfarms aims to improve returns on invested capital while reducing exposure to regions it no longer views as central to its long-term plans. Latin America exit The Paso Pe transaction completes Bitfarms’ withdrawal from Paraguay following an earlier divestment in the country. Just under a year ago, the company sold its Yguazú site to Hive Digital Technologies. Together, the two sales signal a full exit from Latin American operations. For Bitfarms, the decision underscores a strategic narrowing of focus. The company is prioritising jurisdictions and assets that can support both crypto mining and next-generation computing, rather than maintaining a broad international footprint. Market reaction The announcement adds to a wave of strategic repositioning among listed bitcoin miners as they reassess capital allocation amid shifting energy economics and rising interest in alternative compute uses. By accelerating cash realisation from legacy mining assets, Bitfarms is seeking greater flexibility to fund infrastructure that supports both digital asset mining and broader compute demand, reducing reliance on a single revenue stream.

Latest on‑chain data from CryptoQuant shows renewed accumulation, sparking debate over whether this signals a bullish surge or market caution ahead. Whale accumulation can drive bullish momentum. By removing coins from circulation, large investors support prices during consolidation. Historically, such buying during dips has often preceded upward moves, fueling optimism for a broader market recovery. Bitcoin ATM Fraud Hits Record Levels as Adoption Surges in the U.S. Bitcoin ATMs are booming across the U.S., but so are the risks. From January to November 2025, the FBI’s IC3 logged over 12,000 complaints and $333.5 M in losses, surging past 2024 levels and highlighting growing vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem. In 2025, over 10,000 people fell victim to Bitcoin ATM fraud. Scammers exploit crypto’s speed and anonymity through fake tech support, bogus investments, and high-pressure schemes, tricking users into irreversible ATM transfers. As Bitcoin ATMs surged past 30,000 in the U.S.,over 80% of the global total by the end of 2024, fraud has risen in tandem. While these machines offer easy crypto access, their rapid expansion has opened new avenues for criminal activity. Law enforcement continues to track Bitcoin ATM fraud and urges prompt reporting of suspicious activity. IC3 data highlights the need for public awareness, stronger security, and education to reduce losses. While cryptocurrency adoption grows, rising fraud underscores that financial innovation often attracts sophisticated criminal schemes. As the U.S. leads globally in bitcoin ATM installations, users and regulators must balance accessibility with safety. Enhanced vigilance, smarter reporting tools, and informed education are essential to curb fraud in this rapidly evolving sector. Conclusion Bitcoin accumulation by whales can signal bullish potential. By absorbing available supply, they reduce coins in circulation, often supporting prices during consolidation. Historically, whale buying on dips has preceded upward moves, suggesting the market could be gearing for a broader recovery. On the other hand, the rapid spread of Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. has fueled a surge in fraud, underscoring the urgent need for user vigilance and education. While these machines make crypto accessible, transactions are irreversible, making caution essential. Strengthening awareness, reporting, and security measures is key to safeguarding consumers and ensuring the safe, sustainable growth of digital finance.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The market leader made a play for a new all-time high above $100,000 as early as January, but struggled to keep its six-figure valuation as the year wound down. The Bitcoin price has started the new year in a similar fashion to 2025, making its way above the $90,000 mark. However, the market uncertainty is at a record high, with no one knowing what to expect from the digital asset market in 2026. BTC Price Consolidating In Symmetrical Triangle — What Next? In a January 3 post on the social media platform X, market analyst Ali Martinez painted a bullish picture for the Bitcoin price. The crypto pundit postulated that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be gearing up for an upward 15% price move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally To All-Time Highs If It Breaks This Resistance Level The rationale behind this optimistic prediction is the appearance of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin price chart. The symmetrical triangle is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a diagonal falling upper trendline (connecting the swing highs) and a diagonally rising lower trendline (along the swing lows). In this symmetrical triangle chart formation, the asset price (BTC, in this case) typically contracts and moves toward the apex. The Bitcoin price eventually breaches either the upper trendline for a breakout or crosses the lower boundary, forming a breakdown. Hence, the symmetrical triangle pattern could provide a continuation or reversal signal depending on the direction of the break. It is worth mentioning that symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation break patterns, meaning the price tends to break in the initial trend direction before entering into the triangle pattern. If this theory holds in the current scenario, the Bitcoin price is likely to continue its upward movement after breaking the upper trendline here. The critical resistance in the upper trendline lies around the $91,000 region, and the flagship cryptocurrency needs a sustained close of at least two candlesticks above this level to confirm a bullish breakout. The price target is determined by adding the length of the widest point of the triangle (or base) to the breakout point. Based on this calculation, Martinez put forward a target above $102,000 for the Bitcoin price, representing a 15% surge from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $91,560, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

In the past three days, the premier cryptocurrency has gained by 3.4% to trade at $90,500. Bitcoin now lies at a decision point as multiple implications hinge on the next price move. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Whale Comeback Story May Be Overblown, Onchain Data Shows $123,500 Rebound Or $86,000 Pullback: What Next For Bitcoin? In an X post on January 3, pseudonymous analyst Bitcoin Meraklisi shares a two-pronged price analysis of the Bitcoin market. Following its recent rally, the expert explains that Bitcoin sits on top of a three-month downtrend, putting the asset at a decision point. In the bullish scenario of a decisive and convincing breakout past $90,500, Bitcoin is expected to immediately reach $94,800. If this target is met, there would be a strong potential to trade as high as $107,300, moving Bitcoin into the six-figure zones for the first time since mid-November. With an overwhelming bullish conviction, Meraklisi states that the premier cryptocurrency could also rebound to $123,500, representing a potential 36.5% on present market prices. On the other hand, if Bitcoin experiences another rejection, the analyst explains investors should expect an initial price drop to $88,000. However, a continued pullback to around $86,000 also remains on the card. Interestingly, Bitcoin Meraklisi notes that price prediction is presently difficult, considering the market’s heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic and external events. Over the past year, Bitcoin continued to experience growing adoption, reflected in rising institutional and government participation. However, the premier cryptocurrency has also suffered price declines due to geopolitical tensions and renewed trade-war concerns Related Reading: Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon Bitcoin RSI Flashes Positive Signal Amid the present market uncertainty, Meraklisi also notes that the Bitcoin relative strength index is showing a positive market signal after breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern to end a 3-month downtrend. If treated as a leading signal, this RSI breakout suggests that Bitcoin may overcome its current resistance level and potentially transition into a bullish price trajectory. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at $90,603, reflecting market gains of 0.76% and 3.13% in the last one and seven days, respectively. However, the monthly chart reports a minor loss of 1.68%, suggesting the market recovery is yet to commence. Bitcoin boasts a total market cap of $1.8 trillion and is ranked the largest cryptocurrency and eight largest asset in the world.

At the same time, capital is quietly rotating into utility-driven digital assets that can operate alongside traditional finance. Bitcoin has begun the year reclaiming momentum above $89,000, but it’s not the only one. Against this backdrop, Remittix , a new PayFi solution on Ethereum, is also starting to enjoy increased attention and adoption. Bitcoin Shows Early Signs of a Macro Trend Shift Towards the end of 2025, Bitcoin price predictions were very bearish because of the high number of token sell-offs. However, since the start of this year, the BTC price has been performing well again. Currently, Bitcoin is trading very close to $90,000 again, with a demonstrable marked refusal to break below the $88,000 mark. Because of this, traders are now speculating whether Bitcoin has enough momentum to ride this wave all the way back above $100,000. Even institutional behavior appears to support this narrative. Tether’s decision to add nearly $800 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing total holdings above 96,000 BTC. By allocating up to 15% of quarterly profits to Bitcoin acquisitions, Tether has reinforced the idea that Bitcoin remains central to crypto’s financial infrastructure, especially during uncertain macro conditions. Analysts and price prediction models expect it to happen. But in the meantime, Bitcoin investors are also diversifying exposure into lower-priced tokens with similar upside potential like Remittix. Remittix Emerges as the Leading Utility Counterpart to Bitcoin As discussions about Bitcoin’s performance abound and market speculations about its future continue, Remittix , a PayFi altcoin on Ethereum, is also enjoying lots of attention. Remittix has already secured over $28.6 million in private funding from investors and secured token listings on top exchanges like BitMart and LBANK, signalling strong adoption. According to analysts, the adoption strength Remittix is enjoying comes down to its incredible utility. Remittix is currently positioned at the intersection of cryptocurrency, payments, and global remittance with a focus on solving the $19 trillion problem of global payments. The Remittix wallet is already live on the app store, marking its first major product release. More importantly, the team has announced the launch of its crypto-to-fiat platform on February 9, 2026 , a milestone that could materially expand real-world usage. Here are some other things investors love about Remittix: Remittix is fully audited and verified by CertiK , boosting investor trust Impressive global adoption potential with Remittix already delivering live crypto-to-fiat support for individuals, merchants, and institutions in 30 different countries New limited-time 200% bonus on new deposits Clear payment-focused utility rather than speculative narratives The 2026 macro cycle appears increasingly favourable for assets that serve distinct but reinforcing roles. Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto market as a monetary benchmark, while Remittix is positioning itself as a utility layer designed for real financial activity.

According to analysts, now appears to be a good time to buy Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has been gaining strength since the start of 2026, and investor patterns suggest strong institutional backing. This is in line with the current market trend of investor focus on products with solid real-world use. What makes Remittix different from other payment tokens? Remittix combines a live mobile wallet, planned crypto-to-fiat rails, and integrations for merchants with strong security practices. A CertiK audit, Skynet number one ranking, KYC verified team and confirmed listings on crypto exchanges give it a more complete profile than many purely speculative payment tokens. When does Remittix launch its payment platform? Remittix has confirmed that its crypto-to-fiat PayFi platform will launch on February 9, 2026.",Press Release,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The collapse erased household savings and pushed the prices of essential goods higher. According to reports, inflation rose to 42.2% year over year in December, while food prices and health-related costs climbed to 72% and 50%, respectively. The reports have worsened public frustration amid fears of hyperinflation. Demonstrations have expanded across several areas in Tehran and some major cities. Shopkeepers near the Grand Bazaar closed their stores and gathered in protest, adding their voices to the frustration of the masses. Stablecoin usage on the rise in Iran as rial plunges According to videos scattered online, there are several groups chanting against the ruling class, though authorities dispute the timelines around the footage. President Masoud Pezeshkian has also acknowledged the unrest, urging officials to move swiftly to tackle the issues that he describes as legitimate economic concerns. He has instructed the interior minister to engage directly with the leader of the protest. Parliament Speaker Mohammed Bagher Qalibaf has also called for urgent measures to protect the Iranian rial. He made the call while accusing foreign adversaries of taking advantage of the unrest. Despite these statements, footage has shown security forces deploying tear gas in some areas. Meanwhile, Iranians are now swiftly turning to cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as the rial continues to lose value. Most of them confirmed to have made the move to protect their purchasing power. Blockchain analysts have long tracked this trend in sanctioned economies, where access to traditional banking remains limited. Iranians are particularly gravitating towards stablecoins pegged to the United States dollar, as they see it as a practical hedge against local currency declines, especially during periods of instability and rapid devaluation cycles. The shift is also in line with Iran’s engagement with digital assets. According to earlier reports, Iran’s Ministry of Defense Export Center has signaled its intention to accept digital assets for payments for sales of arms overseas. Chainalysis also previously reported that sanctioned countries received more than $16 billion in digital assets in a single year, showing how digital assets and their underlying technology have been supporting cross-border transactions under pressure. Geopolitical tensions and economic turmoil The economic crisis has also caused a swift fallout as Central Bank Governor Mohammed Reza Farzin resigned on Monday, according to state media. Meanwhile, the renewed United Nations sanctions in 2025, which are tied to Iran’s nuclear program, have further restricted its access to three global markets, intensifying capital flight. Authorities have also announced temporary shutdowns across Tehran and other provinces, citing energy shortages and cold weather. Meanwhile, residents claim that despite the government shutdown, there has been a history of crypto firms tied to the administration carrying out energy-intensive mining operations . Geopolitical risks have resurfaced as the United States has warned Iran against any attempt to rebuild nuclear or missile capabilities. United States President Donald Trump has said that the United States would act again if Iran moved ahead to restore its nuclear program, though he noted that there could be a negotiated deal.

Others believe the following 12 months will be generous only for the bears, envisioning a severe pullback. The Bullish Scenario The largest cryptocurrency had its shining moments in 2025, and its price reached a new record of over $126,000 at the beginning of October. However, the following months were brutal, and BTC closed the year at around $87,000, marking an annual loss. In fact, this was the first time the asset ended a post-halving year in the red. Numerous analysts seem unconcerned about this, though, predicting that 2026 will be much more successful. X user KAY noted the latest resurgence to over $90,000, claiming that BTC’s “Adam and Eve” pattern is in play. The chat resembles a short dump followed by a rounding bottom formation. According to the market observer, BTC now needs a strong breakout above $94,000, after which “the bulls will be back in control.” JAVON MARKS and Crypto GEMS were even more optimistic. The former sees the asset rising to a new all-time high of $126,200, whereas the latter expects it to top around $210,000 sometime this year. Earlier this week, Ali Martinez revealed that approximately 20,000 BTC had left exchanges in the past week alone. The USD equivalent of the stash is almost $1.8 billion, and it supports the bullish thesis. Shifting from centralized exchanges to self-custody methods reduces selling pressure, while increased exchange balances could be interpreted as a pre-sale step. Major Dump Incoming? Some analysts stand in the opposite corner, forecasting that 2026 could be a devastating year for BTC. X user CryptoBullet said the asset’s 2025 looks “very bad,” rejecting the possibility that it could reach a fresh peak in 2026. “If you think that wasn’t the Cycle Top and in 2026 BTC will somehow go to a new ATH, you’re an idiot,” they added. According to many experts, Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle may no longer be valid. However, if the pattern remains intact, some analysts warn that a sharp price collapse could occur as early as this month. X user Chiefy, for instance, commented : “If the 4-year cycle is still in play, BTC will dump to $32,000 in January. Do you think you’re prepared for this scenario?” For their part, Crypto Caeser forecasted that BTC may trade in the wide range between $80,687 and $98,880 “for a while.” The post Top Bitcoin (BTC) Price Predictions for 2026 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

The strikes took place at around 6 a.m. UTC and lasted for about 30 minutes, reports show. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Whale Comeback Story May Be Overblown, Onchain Data Shows Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, wrote on X that he does not expect “a widespread correction” tied to the attack, arguing the event was planned and has already passed market participants. Other analysts shared a similar view, saying dramatic moves usually come when traders expect worse things ahead. Bitcoin: Market Moves And Liquidations Based on reports, Bitcoin held firm above the $90,000 mark. CoinGecko data showed a rise of 1.50%, putting the token at $91,320 at the time of publication. I don’t think we’ll see a widespread correction based on the attack in Venezuela on #Bitcoin. It’s a planned and coordinated attack on Maduro, and is already past us. The likelihood of more negativity on the markets from that single event are relatively slim. I would assume… — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 3, 2026 CoinGlass figures indicate about $60 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated over the prior 24 hours, with roughly $55 million of that coming from short bets. That kind of forced selling can amp up volatility for a short period. Still, the broader pattern this time looked muted. Historical Drops Have Happened Fast There have been episodes when conflict pushed prices down quickly. In June 2025, for example, Bitcoin fell nearly 3%, sliding from $106,000 to $103,000 inside roughly 90 minutes after explosions in Tehran. Traders point out that sudden moves often follow when markets fear ongoing escalation. Here, many market watchers see less chance of follow-up actions that would deepen panic. Federal Debt And Genesis Day In The Middle Of Market Noise Based on reports, the US national debt passed $38 trillion on Saturday, with the US National Debt Clock placing it near $38.5 at the time. That milestone came as Bitcoin fans marked “Genesis Day,” the anniversary of the first block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. Happy Bitcoin Genesis Block day — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) January 3, 2026 Paolo Ardoino, CEO of stablecoin issuer Tether, posted a celebratory message, while Sam Callahan, director of strategy and research at BTC treasury firm OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment. For many in the community, the headline embedded in the Genesis Block remains a symbol of a monetary system capped in supply and not subject to the same printing pressures as fiat. Yeah generally the market really nukes when we expect things to get worse afterwards which doesn’t seem to be the case. Could see this actually bring some green to the market as people take this as a sign of strength tho — Tyler Hill (@Tylerhill) January 3, 2026 Community Reaction And Context Reports have shown some in the crypto space treated events like the strike and the rising US debt as separate but related stories. A few traders said the strike could bring “green” to markets as investors interpret decisive action as a sign of control, an outlook voiced by analyst Tyler Hill.

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00024675 to $0.00024770. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market inched higher over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the crucial $90,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) and other tokens registered marginal gains as the crypto market cap rose almost 1% at $3.11 trillion. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Ready For Move To $0.00024470 Husky Inu (HINU) is set for its next price increase during the pre-launch phase, which will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00024675 to $0.00024770. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Can Husky Inu AI Raise $1M? Husky Inu AI faced a dramatic slowdown in fundraising towards the end of 2025 as the markets faced a notable slowdown after the October flash crash. As a result, fundraising crawled to a halt as the project struggled to raise funds. The project has raised $917,618 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. Cryptocurrency Market Remains Positive Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market continued in positive territory over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other altcoins registered notable gains. BTC finally reclaimed the $90,000 mark as it rallied from Saturday’s low of $89,407 to cross $90,000 and reach an intraday high of $91,352. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading around $91,236, up 1.12%. ETH continued consolidating above $3,000, rising from a low of $3,081 to an intraday high of $3,159. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency is trading around $3,147, up almost 1%. Ripple (XRP) has reclaimed $2 and is trading around $2.04, up almost 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up 1.29% at $134. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 4% and Cardano (ADA) is up 0.68% at $0.397. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) have also registered notable increases over the past 24 hours. However, Polkadot (DOT) bucked the bullish trend and is down nearly 1% at $2.13.

While the price has shown signs of recovery, momentum remains muted, keeping the market in a fragile equilibrium. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has registered a bullish breakout above the descending channel that previously defined the corrective structure. This breakout is technically constructive, as it signals a shift away from persistent lower highs and sustained sell-side control. However, the quality of this breakout remains questionable due to the lack of strong bullish momentum and follow-through. The price has moved higher, but candles remain relatively shallow and overlapping, suggesting that buyers are not yet acting with conviction. Bitcoin is now approaching the main resistance zone around the $94K–$96K region, which aligns with a prior high-volume supply area. This level is critical, as it represents the first major test of the bullish breakout. A failure to reclaim and hold above this resistance would increase the risk of a false breakout, potentially pulling the price back into the prior range. For the daily structure to shift decisively bullish, BTC needs sustained acceptance above resistance, supported by volatility expansion and directional momentum. Until then, the breakout should be treated cautiously rather than as confirmation of a new impulsive cycle. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights the current indecision more clearly. The asset is consolidating within a tightening wedge structure, reflecting compression after the initial rebound. Higher lows are forming gradually, but upside progress remains capped by local resistance, keeping the price locked in a narrow range. This type of structure typically precedes expansion, but direction remains unresolved. The ongoing consolidation suggests that both buyers and sellers are positioning ahead of a decisive move. Without a clean breakout above the wedge resistance, the recent advance remains corrective within the broader context. A sustained break higher, followed by acceptance above local resistance of $95K, would be required to support the case for another bullish cycle. Conversely, failure to resolve higher could result in renewed downside pressure and a return toward the lower demand zones at the $80K range. Until resolution occurs, range-bound and liquidity-driven price action remains the dominant theme. Sentiment Analysis The liquidation heatmap provides valuable context for near-term price behaviour. A clear concentration of liquidation levels has built up below the current price, particularly around the $85K–$87K region, indicating a dense cluster of leveraged long exposure. This liquidity acts as a downside magnet in the event of weakness, as a sharp move lower could trigger cascading liquidations. At the same time, overhead liquidity appears more fragmented, suggesting that upside continuation may require additional buildup before a sustained squeeze can occur. The recent grind higher has already cleared short-term liquidation pockets above with little momentum, reinforcing the idea that current price action lacks strong directional urgency. As long as Bitcoin remains within this liquidity balance, short-term moves are likely to be driven by stop-hunts rather than trend expansion. A decisive breakaway from these liquidation clusters will be necessary to confirm the next meaningful directional move.

Only two virtual asset service providers (VASPs) were approved in 2025, down from four in 2024. South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit has also increased approval times from 11 months to 16 months. South Korea’s FIU is delaying approval for VASPs South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) approved only two new virtual asset service providers (VASPs) for the entire year of 2025. Happy Block received approval in January for exchange and trading operations, while Blosafe was approved in August for transfer and storage management services. The average period from application submission to approval increased from 11 months in 2024 to 16 months in 2025. Blosafe’s application took over 600 days to get approved. Industry sources indicate that numerous virtual assets are unable to launch their operations due to these extended delays . Bit Korea, a joint venture with Hana Bank established in 2024, submitted its application to South Korea’s FIU, but so far, the company has not received approval and cannot conduct business. Under South Korea’s regulatory structure, companies can register as virtual asset operators but cannot operate without receiving approval. On December 23, a year and four months past the deadline, the FIU approved the license renewal for Dunamu, which operates Upbit , South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The FIU imposed a 35.2 billion won fine on Dunamu in November 2025 for violations, including negligence in anti-money laundering obligations. Korbit submitted its renewal application in September 2025, while Bithumb, Coinone, and Gopax filed in October. On December 31, Korbit received notification of an institutional warning and a 2.73 billion won fine for regulatory violations. Are suspicious crypto transactions surging in South Korea? Between January and August 2025, virtual asset service providers filed 36,684 suspicious transaction reports with the Financial Intelligence Unit, already exceeding the combined totals of 16,076 reports in 2023 and 19,658 reports in 2024. The Korea Customs Service reported that from 2021 through August 2025, about 9.56 trillion won was involved in cryptocurrency-linked crimes. Approximately 90% of these cases involved hwanchigi schemes, which are illegal foreign remittance operations where criminal proceeds are converted into cryptocurrency through overseas exchanges, routed into domestic platforms, and cashed out in Korean won.

The flagship cryptocurrency briefly lost its hold above the $90,000 mark after US President Donald Trump announced the capture of the Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro. While the long-term impact of the latest US military strikes on the cryptocurrency market remains unknown, the Bitcoin price seems to be gearing up for an upward move in the short term. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the cryptocurrency market leader could potentially reach a correction low. Could A Bottom Be Forming For BTC Price? Crypto analyst Darkfost revealed in a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform that the most reactive group of Bitcoin investors, known as short-term holders (STHs), have remained under pressure, as the BTC price oscillates between the $85,000 and $92,000 levels. Darkfost shared that the Bitcoin short-term holders have their estimated cost basis around $103,000, after accounting for the on-chain impact of Coinbase’s recent large BTC transfers . Based on data from CryptoQuant, the average unrealized losses for this investor cohort stand at around 15%. As Darkfost explained in their Quicktake post, this figure was arrived at based on the percentage deviation from the short-term holder cost basis. “Using this approach makes it possible to identify periods when the most reactive and sensitive investors in the market are under stress,” the on-chain analyst said. From a historical perspective, when Bitcoin short-term holders witness significant drawdowns, and their average unrealized losses stand at around 15%, the formation of a correction low is often next for the premier cryptocurrency. According to Darkfost, BTC could be staring at a similar situation here. However, the crypto analyst noted that this signal could be false, especially if the Bitcoin price is at the start of an extended bear market. A deep or prolonged bear market could cause the STH’s unrealized losses to stay above 15% for longer periods or open the door to persistent distribution. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $91,160, reflecting a more than 1% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency has increased by nearly 4% in the past seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Reports show a sharp fall in money stolen by wallet-draining scams, even as attackers tested new tricks tied to recent protocol changes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Scam Sniffer Data Shows Drop According to Scam Sniffer’s 2025 analysis, wallet drainer phishing losses fell to about $83.85 million — an 83% decline from roughly $494 million in 2024. The number of affected wallets dropped to around 106,000, a fall of about 68% year-on-year. These figures come from the security platform’s annual study and were picked up by major crypto outlets. Attackers Shift, Not Stop Only 11 incidents topped $1 million in 2025, down from 30 the prior year, signaling fewer headline grabs but a rise in smaller hits. The largest single theft recorded last year was roughly $6.5 million, tied to a malicious Permit signature attack. Average losses per victim fell to roughly $790, which suggests attackers moved toward more frequent, lower-value strikes. Market Moves Mattered Losses followed market activity. The third quarter logged the highest damage at about $31 million, when Ethereum’s rally brought more users and approvals onchain. Monthly peaks included August, which posted about $12.17 million, while December was the quietest with roughly $2 million. That pattern shows fraudsters target busy trading windows. 1/ Ever woken up to an empty crypto wallet? With scammers draining $107K+ across EVM chains JUST THIS WEEK (per @zachxbt), it’s scarier than ever! Shoutout to @realscamsniffer for their 2025 report – losses down 83%, but threats are evolving FAST. Let’s recap & warn on 2026… https://t.co/uSerpsg80d — JP (@rugpullfinder) January 3, 2026 Permit Signatures And New Vectors Reports highlighted Permit and Permit2 signature abuses as a major driver of big losses, accounting for a large share of multi-million cases. Scam Sniffer also flagged EIP-7702 batch signature techniques that were used in a few complex attacks after network upgrades. Security teams say these methods exploit user approval flows rather than raw smart-contract bugs. Why The Drop Happened Analysts attribute much of the improvement to better wallet warnings, wider use of approval revocation tools, and more active tracking by onchain monitors. Some defenders also point to reduced market froth in parts of the year, which lowered the pool of high-value targets. Still, multiple outlets stress that reduced totals do not equal safety. Related Reading: A Maduro Bet, A Market Alarm: US Lawmaker Targets Trading Abuses Based on reports, phishing will likely remain cyclical: losses could spike again during big rallies or when new signing features are introduced. Security firms urge users to check approvals, avoid blind signing, and use wallet tools that flag risky requests. Regulators and exchanges are watching the trend, but responsibility for many attacks still falls to individual users and wallet software.

When price compresses after a breakout, experienced traders watch closely, knowing that continuation patterns tend to precede the strongest moves. XRP now trades within such a phase, where technical alignment carries more weight than short-term sentiment or headlines. In a recent post on X, FeFe analyzed XRP’s evolving setup through its four-hour chart, focusing on structure rather than speculation. The analyst argued that XRP’s current behavior reflects a recurring breakout pattern that has historically preceded major upside expansions. This supports FeFe’s November 2025 prediction that XRP could move from $2 to $20. XRP Holds Above a Key Breakout Level As of report time, XRP trades near $2.09 and continues to defend a former resistance zone that has flipped into support. On the 4-hour chart, price broke out cleanly and is now consolidating steadily. XRP maintains a sequence of higher lows while respecting dynamic support levels, a structure that typically signals trend continuation rather than exhaustion. Current TA structure for XRP supports $20 hypothesis https://t.co/NwI6hyIzWN pic.twitter.com/1fx41GTRYf — FeFe (@fefe01101100) January 4, 2026 This behavior suggests that buyers continue to absorb selling pressure without allowing meaningful breakdowns. Such stability often appears when the market prepares for expansion rather than reversal. Fractal Structure Reflects Previous XRP Rallies FeFe’s analysis places strong emphasis on fractal behavior. XRP’s current four-hour pattern closely resembles structures that preceded historical surges, where price paused briefly after reclaiming major levels before accelerating sharply. While fractals never repeat perfectly, markets frequently echo similar psychological and liquidity-driven behaviors across cycles. In past instances, XRP resolved comparable consolidation phases with rapid upside once momentum returned. The present structure continues to align with those historical precedents. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Basis for the $20 Hypothesis The $20 target emerges from the alignment of short-term structure with higher-timeframe technical projections. FeFe connects the four-hour breakout to broader Fibonacci extensions and prior cycle range expansions that converge near the $20 region. His November 2025 thesis framed the move as a structural expansion rather than a speculative spike, contingent on XRP holding its reclaimed support zones. So far, price action continues to validate that framework. XRP has not displayed signs of distribution or trend failure within the current structure. Structure Signals Probability, Not Certainty Despite the constructive setup, FeFe maintains a disciplined stance on risk. Market structure defines probability rather than guaranteed outcomes. Bitcoin dominance, liquidity, and macro trends will still impact whether this plays out. A sustained loss of current support would weaken the thesis and invalidate the pattern. For now, XRP’s technical structure offers one of its strongest confirmations in this cycle, with price behavior supporting the $20 hypothesis through structure-driven evidence rather than hype.

He had been sentenced in November 2024 for a money-laundering conspiracy tied to the theft of about 120,000 bitcoin, one of the largest crypto thefts on record. The move has reignited debate over how prison credits and reform laws affect high-value cybercrime cases. Bitcoin Hacker’s Release Credited To First Step Act According to Lichtenstein’s public posts and interviews, he credited his early freedom to the First Step Act, the prison-reform law signed by US President Donald Trump in 2018. Reports say he was placed on home confinement after qualifying for earned time credits and program participation, a process allowed under federal rules. He posted on social media a short message thanking Trump and saying he hopes to work in cybersecurity going forward. Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can. To the supporters, thank you for everything.To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong. — Ilya Lichtenstein (@cipherstein) January 2, 2026 The Theft And The Sentence Based on reports from federal prosecutors, the Bitfinex breach involved nearly 120,000 bitcoin , which at the time was worth roughly $71 million and later ballooned in value as markets rose. Lichtenstein pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in US District Court on November 14, 2024. The Department of Justice described the laundering operation as complex and said prosecutors recovered the bulk of the stolen funds. Details Of The Case Reports have disclosed that Lichtenstein and his then-partner Heather Morgan used layered transfers, fake identities, and conversions across services to obscure the source of funds. The couple were arrested in 2022 after agents traced a set of private keys and other evidence back to their accounts. Morgan, known online as Razzlekhan, pleaded guilty as well and received a shorter sentence; she was also reported to have been released early. The case drew wide attention because agents later seized a large portion of the assets tied to the hack. Bitcoin Recovery, Seizures And Public Reaction Federal filings and news agencies say investigators recovered more than 90% of the stolen Bitcoin and the government seized billions in crypto-linked assets, a recovery that prosecutors called one of the largest in US history. The sale and custody of those assets remain part of ongoing administrative steps. Many legal experts and members of the public have pushed back on the timing and optics of the early release, arguing that cases involving billions in stolen property raise unusual questions about deterrence and fairness.

Whereas, the total crypto market cap has reached $3.12 trillion along with daily trading volume near $75 billion, reflecting rising institutional activity. The Fear and Greed Index stands at 40 (neutral), a sharp improvement from December’s fear levels, while the Altcoin Season Index at 25 confirms the market remains in a clear Bitcoin-dominant phase. Analysts say ETF demand is tightening supply at a time when liquidity remains thin, creating ideal conditions for higher prices. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Triangle Breakout Points to $94K From a technical perspective, Bitcoin price prediction seems to have turned bullish as it has confirmed a breakout from a triangle after a month-long consolidation. The breakout above $89,500 marks a decisive end to December’s sideways action and hints at the start of a new bullish leg. The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin trading around $91,260, forming a pattern of higher lows and steadily rising volume. A 50-EMA crossover above the 100-EMA confirms strengthening momentum, while the RSI near 69 suggests controlled bullish pressure without entering overbought territory. Candlestick signals reinforce the bullish view, a bullish engulfing candle broke resistance, followed by a spinning top at $92,000, signaling short-term consolidation before a potential continuation higher. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Market Outlook: Eyes on $94K and Beyond If Bitcoin manages to stay above $89,000, we’re looking at the next run-up spots between $93,500 and $94,600- the path seems promising for a possible push towards $98,000 in the coming weeks. But if it were to close below $88,400, though, we could see that whole thing come crashing down and invite some short-term selling. Things are looking optimistic right now, as more ETF money is flowing in and regular traders are jumping back in – of course, it doesn’t hurt that altcoins are still lagging, which suggests a more mature bull run rather than just wild speculation. If this momentum keeps going, Bitcoin could soon be eyeing $100K in Q1 of ’26 – driven by all that new ETF money, plus the fact that significant macro trends are starting to play in favor of digital assets. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-warns-xrp-holders-were-getting-extremely-rich-in-the-next-1-2-months-heres-why/,timestabloid,"Crypto market cycles rarely shift without warning, but they often disguise their most important signals in plain sight. As Bitcoin continues to dominate market liquidity, subtle structural changes are emerging beneath the surface. These shifts tend to appear before capital rotates, not after. For XRP holders, recent market data suggests that the conditions preceding major upside moves may be forming once again. In a recent post that has gained significant traction on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted a historically reliable macro indicator pointing toward a near-term altcoin expansion. Instead of focusing narrowly on XRP price action, the analyst examined Bitcoin dominance trends using Blockchain Center data, framing his outlook within broader market rotation dynamics. Steph argues that this macro setup, rather than hype or sentiment, underpins his bullish short-term outlook. WARNING TO ALL $XRP HOLDERS. WE’RE GETTING EXTREMELY RICH IN THE NEXT 1-2 MONTHS! pic.twitter.com/6sq1yrpSNX — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 3, 2026 Bitcoin Dominance Approaches a Key Historical Threshold Bitcoin dominance currently stands near 59%, a level that has repeatedly acted as a turning point in past bull cycles. When dominance reaches this zone, Bitcoin often begins to lose relative strength as capital searches for higher beta opportunities across the altcoin market. Historical charts from Blockchain Center show that previous stalls at similar dominance levels preceded sharp declines and rapid altcoin outperformance. Steph emphasizes that dominance does not need to collapse instantly to signal rotation. Instead, slowing momentum and structural hesitation often mark the early phase of capital redistribution, which typically benefits large-cap altcoins first. Altcoin Season Index Confirms Early-Stage Conditions Supporting this view, the Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 37, firmly within Bitcoin-dominant territory. This reading suggests most altcoins haven’t yet outperformed Bitcoin, a pattern that historically occurs before (not during) major altcoin rallies. Steph interprets this as confirmation that the market has not entered euphoria, leaving room for expansion rather than exhaustion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Blockchain Center’s long-term models associate this combination of elevated Bitcoin dominance and suppressed altcoin performance with the early stages of what it defines as a mini-altseason. Projections suggest this phase will likely start around mid-2026, matching Steph’s short-term expectations. Why XRP Could Benefit Disproportionately XRP often lags during Bitcoin-led phases but accelerates rapidly once capital rotation begins. Its deep liquidity, established infrastructure, and reduced regulatory uncertainty compared to previous cycles position it as a prime candidate during early altcoin inflows. Steph noted that similar structural setups in past cycles preceded sharp XRP moves once dominance began to fade. Probability, Not Certainty Steph makes it clear that dominance charts signal probability rather than guarantees. Broader liquidity conditions, macroeconomic developments, and institutional flows still influence outcomes. However, the alignment of historical dominance behavior, early rotation metrics, and current market structure forms the basis of his conviction. For XRP holders, the data suggests that the market may be closer to a transition than surface-level price action implies.

The top cryptocurrency is currently range-bound after a strong correction from its 2025 highs of more than $126,000. Bitcoin was at one point considered the only best investment option in the crypto market. However, currently, it has limited room to grow due to its massive market capitalization of over $1.76 trillion and its strong institutional inflow via exchange-traded funds. Its potential appears to be climaxing as experts project a further consolidation or even correction in case of weak economic conditions. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a nascent and very promising DeFi token trading for well under $0.05, provides a much higher possible rate of return on investment as a DeFi token. With funding of $19,600,000 and no less than 18,660 investors on board already, a relatively low stake of just $1,000 invested now in Phase 7 pricing levels might provide as much as a return of 35x in four months if the post-listing token performance follows projected levels, elevating the investment to a total of $35,000. Bitcoin Enters Stagnant Phase Bitcoin is currently trending between $87,000 and $89,000, registering small gains on a daily basis but no breakout yet. After registering the first annual loss since 2022 at the close of the year 2025, it’s safe to state that this particular asset has finally demonstrated maturity and no longer exemplifies explosive growth. High pricing makes it difficult for this particular asset to register dramatic price multiples. Whereas for those investors actively looking for the next big cryptocurrency or the best one to buy, Bitcoin is slowly being perceived less as a highly attractive growth play and more as a store of value, due to the absence of either this utility or the associated scarcity factor, characteristic of DeFi projects. Presale Activity Regains Momentum Mutuum Finance has launched Phase 7 of its presale and the price is set at $0.04, benefiting a 300% surge since Phase 1 when it was only $0.01. More than $19,600,000 has been successfully raised, and there are 18,660 holders who believe that this is one of the best crypto to invest in today. However, phase 7 is filling up very rapidly, which presents the last chance to acquire tokens at this pricing as phase 8 will start at $0.045. The price set for the upcoming launch is pegged at $0.06, which puts today’s investors right on target for immediate ROI even before MUTM officially starts trading. All the preceding presale phases offered quick sellouts due to the rising demand of the tokens. An increase in dual lending One key advantage of Mutuum Finance is its new dual-market lending platform, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled markets with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) direct contracts. On the P2C markets, participants lock away their assets in the form of ETH or USDT in order to generate passive income based on the pool of loans being issued in the market. Suppliers receive mtTokens, which earn interest automatically. For instance, investing $5,000 in ETH might produce a potential annual interest rate of 8%, meaning that a passive profit of $400 can be accrued without even liquidating the invested asset. The second model enables users to invest in more volatile assets, where mutually beneficial terms that are not commonly witnessed on other platforms are feasible on a P2P basis. Therefore, MUTM is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy, considering its use case that surpasses mere speculation. Stablecoin Increases Long-Term Value Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance has plans to introduce an on-demand stablecoin fully pegged at a one-to-one ratio with the dollar, which will further enhance its entire ecosystem for all participants. This will ensure that the volatility risk exposure is further reduced while also enhancing the liquidity pools and institutional-grade borrowers on the platform. Portion of the fees generated in the platform will be subject to buybacks before being distributed to stakers. Analysts believe the various MUTM fundamentals such as its lending and borrowing models, native stablecoin, and buyback & distribute mechanisms will push prices towards $0.10 and above in the first year of its existence, yielding a profit of 200% or more from the current prices. Grasping Emerging Opportunities For those hoping to find the best cryptocurrency to invest, or the best investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies in the near future, Mutuum Finance sets itself apart. As the price of Bitcoin holds firm at unusually high levels without significant appreciation, MUTM has the rarity, the usability, and the potential for appreciation that truly characterizes the leading cryptocurrencies.

This event, occurring as global markets resumed activity on Monday, underscores the persistent and critical disconnect between regulated financial derivatives and the ceaseless cryptocurrency spot markets. Consequently, this gap immediately captured the attention of institutional and retail traders alike, who monitor such discrepancies for potential trading signals and market equilibrium clues. Decoding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The $1,065 opening discrepancy is not a random price fluctuation. Instead, it is a direct structural artifact of the trading calendars governing different market venues. Specifically, the CME’s Bitcoin futures market operates on a traditional schedule, closing on weekends and holidays. Conversely, the underlying Bitcoin spot market trades continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Therefore, when the futures market reopens, its price must instantly adjust to reflect all price discovery that occurred in the spot market during its closure. This adjustment manifests as a gap on the price chart. Market technicians and seasoned futures traders pay close attention to these gaps. Historically, there is a observed tendency for prices to “fill” or revert to the level of the gap at a later point. This expectation stems from the theory of market efficiency, which suggests that such arbitrage opportunities between closely linked markets are temporary. However, the fill is not guaranteed and depends heavily on subsequent market sentiment and liquidity flows. Price Discovery: The gap represents deferred price discovery from the weekend’s spot trading. Arbitrage Signal: It creates a potential arbitrage opportunity between futures and spot prices. Sentiment Indicator: A gap up, as seen here, generally reflects bullish sentiment that built over the weekend. The Broader Context of Cryptocurrency Derivatives This specific event fits into the larger, evolving narrative of cryptocurrency financialization. The CME launched its Bitcoin futures in December 2017, providing the first regulated venue for institutional exposure. Since then, the market has matured dramatically. For instance, open interest—the total number of outstanding contracts—regularly exceeds billions of dollars, signaling deep institutional participation. Furthermore, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has created additional layers of interplay between spot prices, futures prices, and fund NAVs. The behavior of CME futures also influences other market metrics. Analysts often scrutinize the CME futures basis—the difference between the futures price and the spot price. A positive basis, or contango, suggests the market expects higher future prices. The weekend gap directly impacts this basis at the open, creating a momentary distortion that traders may seek to exploit. Additionally, the quarterly expiration and roll of these futures contracts are now major events on the crypto calendar, often accompanied by increased volatility. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Impact Financial analysts emphasize that these gaps are a feature, not a bug, of the current market infrastructure. They highlight the role of market makers and arbitrage desks, whose job is to profit from these very inefficiencies, thereby providing liquidity and helping to close the gap. Their activity is a primary mechanism that pulls futures prices toward spot prices, or vice versa. However, during periods of extreme volatility or low liquidity, gaps can widen and persist longer than usual. The long-term impact of these recurring events is a more integrated market. Each gap and subsequent fill contributes to price convergence and teaches market participants about the dynamics between continuous and discrete trading venues. Regulatory bodies monitor this activity closely, as the CME’s regulated nature provides a transparent price benchmark that influences the broader, less-regulated crypto ecosystem. Data from past gaps shows no consistent predictive power for long-term price direction, but they remain a crucial short-term tactical indicator for active traders. Conclusion The $1,065 CME Bitcoin futures gap serves as a powerful, real-time case study in market mechanics. It vividly illustrates the tension between traditional financial market hours and the perpetual motion of digital asset markets. Understanding this phenomenon is essential for any serious market participant, as it reveals the ongoing process of price discovery and integration between the nascent crypto economy and established financial systems. Ultimately, while individual gaps may capture headlines, their true significance lies in what they reveal about the deepening sophistication and interconnectedness of global cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What causes a gap in CME Bitcoin futures? A gap occurs because the CME futures market is closed on weekends while Bitcoin trades 24/7. The Monday open price must therefore jump to reflect all weekend spot market activity, creating a visible gap on the chart. Q2: Do futures gaps always get filled? While there is a strong historical tendency for prices to retrace and “fill” the gap, it is not a certainty. Market sentiment, news flow, and macro conditions can override this technical pattern. Q3: How do institutional traders use these gaps? Institutions and arbitrage desks often use gaps to execute strategies that bet on price convergence. They may short futures if the gap up is deemed excessive or go long if a gap down presents a buying opportunity relative to spot. Q4: What is the difference between a CME futures gap and regular Bitcoin volatility? A gap is a specific structural discontinuity caused by market hours. General volatility occurs during continuous trading due to news, order flow, and sentiment. Gaps are predictable in timing (market open) but unpredictable in size and direction. Q5: Does the CME futures price influence the spot Bitcoin price? Yes, they influence each other. The CME price is a major regulated benchmark. Significant moves there can affect sentiment and algorithmic trading in the spot market, and vice-versa, especially around gap openings and contract expirations.

This milestone represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, continuing a multi-week bullish trend that has captured global financial attention. Consequently, analysts are now examining the confluence of factors driving this ascent and its potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $92,000 Milestone The move past $92,000 marks a critical technical and psychological threshold for Bitcoin. Historically, round-number levels often act as both resistance and support zones. This specific price point follows a consolidation period where BTC tested the $88,000 to $90,000 range multiple times. Market data reveals a steady increase in trading volume on major exchanges, particularly Binance, which often leads price discovery. Furthermore, the Binance USDT pair, being one of the most liquid trading pairs globally, provides a reliable benchmark for the asset’s global valuation. Several key metrics underscore the strength of this move. The 24-hour trading volume for Bitcoin has increased by approximately 35% compared to the weekly average. Additionally, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has risen, indicating sustained institutional and retail participation. Importantly, the rally has occurred with relatively low volatility for such a significant price jump, suggesting a foundation of strong buyer conviction rather than speculative frenzy. Technical and On-Chain Context On-chain analytics firms report a decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges, signaling a trend toward accumulation and long-term holding. The number of addresses holding 1 BTC or more has reached a new all-time high. Simultaneously, the hash rate, a measure of network security and miner commitment, remains near its peak, providing fundamental support for the asset’s value proposition. Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Multiple macroeconomic and sector-specific catalysts are converging to fuel Bitcoin’s current price trajectory. Primarily, shifting monetary policy expectations from major central banks have renewed interest in hard assets. As traditional fiat currencies face inflationary pressures, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a digital store of value. Moreover, recent regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions has reduced uncertainty, allowing institutional capital to flow into the market with greater confidence. The adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset by publicly listed companies continues to provide a structural bid for the asset. Several new corporate announcements in Q1 2025 have added to this trend. Concurrently, developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem itself, including advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, are improving its utility and long-term viability as a payment network. Macroeconomic Factors: Easing inflation data, potential interest rate pauses. Institutional Adoption: New ETF inflows, corporate treasury allocations. Regulatory Landscape: Clearer frameworks in the EU, UK, and parts of Asia. Network Development: Increased activity in layer-2 protocols and smart contract platforms built on Bitcoin. Historical Context and Market Cycle Comparison Bitcoin’s journey to $92,000 must be viewed within its historical market cycles. The asset has experienced several major bull and bear markets since its inception. The current rally shares characteristics with past cycles, including rising public interest and increasing media coverage. However, it also exhibits distinct differences, notably the depth of institutional involvement and its integration into traditional finance. For instance, the approval and success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have created a new, regulated channel for investment that did not exist in previous cycles. The following table compares key metrics from the 2021 cycle peak to the current environment: Metric 2021 Cycle (Nov 2021) Current Environment (April 2025) Price (Approx.) $69,000 $92,000 Primary Driver Retail FOMO, Low Rates Institutional ETFs, Macro Hedge Exchange Balances High & Increasing Low & Decreasing Mayer Multiple (Price/200D MA) ~2.5 ~1.8 This comparison suggests the market structure may be healthier now, with supply increasingly moving to strong, long-term holders. Expert Perspectives on Sustainability Market analysts offer measured perspectives on the rally’s sustainability. “While the breach of $92,000 is technically significant, the underlying on-chain health is more telling,” notes a senior analyst from a major crypto research firm. “We are seeing accumulation from long-term holders, not just leveraged speculation. This suggests a more durable price foundation.” Other experts point to the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle, a pre-programmed event that reduces the rate of new supply, as a fundamental tailwind that has historically preceded major price appreciation periods. Potential Impacts and Future Trajectory The sustained price above $92,000 has immediate and longer-term implications. In the short term, it can trigger algorithmic trading strategies and options market activity centered around key price levels. For the broader cryptocurrency market, a strong Bitcoin often acts as a rising tide, lifting the valuations of alternative digital assets (altcoins) as investor confidence grows. However, it can also lead to capital rotation out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, a phenomenon known as ‘Bitcoin dominance.’ Looking ahead, the next significant resistance levels are widely viewed as the previous all-time high near $100,000 and the psychologically important $100,000 mark itself. Market participants will closely watch for a sustained weekly close above $92,000 to confirm the breakout’s validity. Conversely, key support levels to monitor are now situated around $88,000 and $85,000, which were former resistance zones. The overall health of global risk assets and any shifts in monetary policy will remain primary external factors influencing Bitcoin’s path forward. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $92,000 represents a major milestone, underscored by strong technicals, improving fundamentals, and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. This move is not an isolated event but part of a broader narrative of digital asset maturation and integration into the global financial system. The Bitcoin price action reflects a complex interplay of supply dynamics, institutional adoption, and macro hedging demand. As the market digests this level, the focus will shift to sustainability, network growth, and the evolving role of cryptocurrency in a digital-first economy. The journey to this BTC $92,000 valuation highlights the asset’s continued resilience and its growing significance on the world financial stage. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $92,000 on Binance USDT mean? It means that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin can be bought or sold for approximately 92,000 Tether (USDT) tokens, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This is a key global pricing benchmark due to Binance’s high liquidity. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin’s price is rising? Primary drivers include increased institutional investment through ETFs, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, decreasing supply on exchanges, and positive developments in its underlying technology and regulatory environment. Q3: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The previous all-time high was approximately $73,000 in March 2024. The current price of $92,000 represents a new record high, surpassing the previous peak by a significant margin. Q4: Is now a good time to invest in Bitcoin? This is a financial decision that depends on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and research. Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider consulting a qualified financial advisor. Q5: What happens if Bitcoin’s price falls below $92,000 again? Price retracements are common in volatile markets. A drop below this level would likely see the market test nearby support zones, such as $88,000. It does not invalidate the long-term trend but would indicate a period of consolidation or correction.

This nuanced change, reported by data provider Alternative.me, offers a critical snapshot of investor psychology amid ongoing market consolidation and provides a data-driven lens for analyzing potential future trajectories. For traders and long-term holders alike, understanding the mechanics and implications of this sentiment gauge is essential for navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Rise to 26 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a daily barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Consequently, its movement from 25 to 26 represents more than a simple numerical change. Fundamentally, the index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ Therefore, a reading of 26 firmly places market sentiment in the ‘Fear’ zone, but at its higher threshold, suggesting a tentative reduction in pervasive pessimism. Historically, sustained periods in Extreme Fear have often preceded market rebounds, making exits from this zone noteworthy events for analysts. Alternative.me compiles this index using a multifaceted, weighted formula designed to quantify qualitative market emotions. The provider aggregates data from six primary sources to ensure a balanced and robust reading. For instance, market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score, capturing raw market activity and turbulence. Simultaneously, social media sentiment and surveys each account for 15%, directly measuring community and investor outlook. Finally, Bitcoin’s market dominance and relevant Google search trends each make up 10%, reflecting Bitcoin’s overarching influence and public interest levels. This methodological blend prevents the index from relying on any single metric. The Components Driving Market Sentiment Shifts To understand the index’s recent climb, one must examine the underlying components. Market volatility, a key 25% input, has shown signs of stabilization compared to the extreme swings witnessed in previous months. Although volatility remains elevated by traditional asset standards, its relative calming likely contributed positively to the score. Similarly, trading volume, the other major 25% component, has seen modest but consistent activity, indicating that market participants are still engaged rather than exiting entirely. On the social and survey front, analysis of major crypto discussion forums and news sentiment reveals a cautious uptick in neutral-to-hopeful discourse, moving away from overwhelmingly negative narratives. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market dominance has held relatively steady, maintaining its role as the market anchor. Google search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘crypto bear market’ has slightly declined, while searches for ‘crypto recovery’ and ‘buy Bitcoin’ have seen minor increases. This collective shift in data points coalesced into the one-point index gain. Historical Context and Expert Analysis of Sentiment Indicators Financial psychologists and behavioral economists have long studied sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index. Dr. Amelia Chen, a behavioral finance researcher, notes, ‘Sentiment indices are contrarian indicators at extremes. A move out of Extreme Fear doesn’t signal an all-clear, but it does suggest the peak of panic may be passing. Market bottoms are processes, not points, and sentiment improvement is a necessary first step.’ This perspective aligns with historical index data, which shows that prolonged stays in Extreme Fear (readings below 25) have frequently marked accumulation phases for strategic investors. The following table illustrates the index’s categorization and typical market characteristics associated with each zone: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear High selling pressure, negative news dominance, potential capitulation. 25-49 Fear Cautious trading, mixed sentiment, consolidation phases. 50-74 Greed Increasing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), rising prices, bullish news. 75-100 Extreme Greed Speculative frenzy, overvaluation concerns, potential market tops. Transitioning from Extreme Fear to Fear often involves a change in market narrative. Currently, this shift coincides with macroeconomic developments, including evolving central bank policies and institutional adoption milestones, which provide a real-world backdrop for the sentiment change. Analysts monitor whether this is a fleeting reaction or the start of a sustained sentiment recovery. Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For market participants, the index’s movement offers practical insights rather than direct buy or sell signals. Primarily, it aids in risk assessment and context setting. When the index resides in Extreme Fear, as it did prior to this update, the probability of panic selling diminishes because the most fearful investors have often already exited. Conversely, a rise toward Greed signals increasing euphoria and potential overextension. Therefore, the current Fear zone suggests a market that is still risk-averse but no longer in a state of maximum panic. Investors should consider the index as one tool among many. Key actions include: Assessing Personal Risk Tolerance: Does a Fear reading align with your investment horizon and strategy? Reviewing Asset Allocation: Sentiment shifts can be opportunities to rebalance portfolios methodically. Monitoring for Confirmation: Watch for supporting technical analysis or on-chain data to validate the sentiment shift. Avoiding Emotional Decisions: The index exists to quantify emotion, helping investors avoid being ruled by it. Ultimately, the index provides a crowd-sourced emotional temperature check. Its value lies in offering a structured, quantitative measure of a qualitative market factor, allowing for more disciplined decision-making. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 26 marks a meaningful, though incremental, improvement in overall market sentiment. This move from Extreme Fear to Fear reflects subtle positive changes across volatility, volume, social discourse, and search trends. While far from indicating greed or bullish euphoria, this shift suggests the intense pessimism that characterized recent months may be beginning to moderate. For astute observers, understanding this sentiment gauge provides crucial context, separating market noise from underlying emotional trends. As always, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an essential tool for navigating the complex psychological landscape of digital asset investing. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 26 mean? A score of 26 places market sentiment in the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that while investors remain cautious and risk-averse, the extreme panic associated with scores below 25 has subsided. This often corresponds with a market phase of consolidation and potentially reduced selling pressure. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how is it calculated? The index is compiled by the data provider Alternative.me. It uses a weighted formula based on six factors: volatility (25%), market volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to generate a single daily score from 0 to 100. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? No, the index is not a direct timing signal. It is a sentiment indicator. Extreme readings (below 10 or above 90) have historically signaled potential market turning points, but they should always be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis. Its primary value is in gauging market psychology. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily. Alternative.me typically publishes the new score based on data from the previous 24-hour period, allowing traders and analysts to track sentiment changes in near real-time. Q5: Has the index ever been wrong or misleading? Like all indicators, it is not infallible. Sentiment can remain in Extreme Fear or Extreme Greed for extended periods during strong bear or bull markets. It measures current emotion, not future price. Therefore, it should be interpreted as a context-providing tool rather than a predictive crystal ball.

This crucial metric, a barometer for market cycle phases, signals a period of pronounced Bitcoin strength relative to alternative cryptocurrencies. Consequently, investors and analysts closely monitor this index to gauge underlying sentiment shifts and potential rotation opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem. The current low score underscores a persistent narrative of Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal during uncertain macroeconomic climates. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Critical Market Thermometer CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index functions as a quantitative market thermometer. It systematically measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets, against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. The methodology is straightforward yet powerful. Analysts calculate the percentage of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin during that period. Market participants declare an official “altcoin season” only when this percentage surpasses the 75% threshold. Therefore, a score of 22 indicates that merely 22% of major altcoins have beaten Bitcoin’s returns recently, firmly placing the market in a Bitcoin-dominant phase. This data-driven approach removes emotional bias from cycle analysis. Understanding this index requires historical context. For instance, during the bull market of late 2020 and early 2021, the index frequently hovered above 75, sometimes reaching 90+. That period witnessed explosive growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects. In contrast, the current reading aligns with phases where macroeconomic headwinds, such as interest rate policies and geopolitical tensions, drive investors toward Bitcoin’s perceived digital gold characteristics. This flight to quality often drains liquidity from higher-risk altcoin investments. Index Range Market Phase Interpretation Typical Investor Sentiment 0-24 Strong Bitcoin Season Risk-Off, Capital Preservation 25-49 Moderate Bitcoin Season Cautious, Selective Altcoin Allocation 50-74 Transition / Neutral Balanced, Awaiting Catalyst 75-100 Altcoin Season Risk-On, High Growth Seeking Historical Precedents and the Path to Altcoin Seasons Market cycles rarely shift abruptly. Historical data reveals that transitions from Bitcoin seasons to altcoin seasons often follow a recognizable pattern. Initially, Bitcoin leads a broad market rally, typically fueled by institutional adoption or macroeconomic triggers like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Subsequently, as Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher range, investor confidence grows. This confidence then fuels a search for higher beta opportunities, gradually rotating capital into altcoins. Key catalysts for this rotation have historically included: Technological Breakthroughs: The advent of smart contract platforms (Ethereum 2017), DeFi summer (2020), and the NFT boom (2021). Regulatory Clarity: Positive regulatory developments for specific blockchain use cases. Macro Liquidity Infusions: Periods of expansive monetary policy increasing risk appetite. Bitcoin Stability: Extended periods of low Bitcoin volatility, reducing its perceived trading advantage. Currently, the index at 22 suggests these catalysts are either absent or insufficient to overcome the prevailing risk-off sentiment. However, analysts note that such low readings can sometimes precede significant shifts, as extreme readings often mark sentiment capitulation points. Monitoring on-chain data for altcoin accumulation by large holders, known as whales, becomes crucial during these phases. Expert Analysis: Interpreting the 22 Reading in 2025’s Landscape Leading market analysts from firms like Glassnode and IntoTheBlock provide essential context for the current index reading. They correlate the low Altcoin Season Index with several observable on-chain and macroeconomic factors. First, Bitcoin’s dominance chart, which measures its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, has remained elevated above 55% for several consecutive months. Second, futures and options market data shows a pronounced skew toward Bitcoin-based derivatives, indicating institutional and sophisticated trader focus. Finally, capital flow metrics reveal net outflows from altcoin-focused investment products while Bitcoin products see sustained, if modest, inflows. This environment presents a dual reality. For long-term investors, a low index may signal a potential accumulation zone for high-conviction altcoin projects with strong fundamentals. Conversely, for short-term traders, it reinforces a strategy of following the dominant trend, which currently favors Bitcoin and perhaps a handful of mega-cap altcoins like Ethereum. The index, therefore, serves not as a timing tool but as a confirmation signal for broader market structure analysis. Strategic Implications for Crypto Portfolios and Market Outlook The persistent low Altcoin Season Index reading carries direct implications for portfolio management strategies. A disciplined, evidence-based approach is paramount in such conditions. Many portfolio managers advocate for a core-satellite model. This model maintains a significant core allocation to Bitcoin, aligning with the dominant trend indicated by the index. Simultaneously, it allows for smaller, strategic satellite allocations to altcoins with robust fundamentals, preparing for a future cycle shift. This method balances risk management with opportunity capture. Looking forward, several factors could catalyze a rise in the index. The continued maturation of layer-2 scaling solutions, which reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, could spur new user adoption for altcoin networks. Furthermore, the integration of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on blockchain platforms may drive fundamental utility and value. However, for the index to sustainably break above 50, the market likely requires a period of sustained Bitcoin stability combined with a clear, narrative-driving innovation within the altcoin ecosystem. Until then, the data suggests patience and selectivity are key virtues for market participants. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index, sitting definitively at 22, offers a data-rich snapshot of the 2025 cryptocurrency market structure. It confirms a phase of Bitcoin dominance, driven by macroeconomic caution and a focus on digital asset bedrock. While this reading may disappoint altcoin enthusiasts hoping for immediate, broad-based rallies, it provides invaluable clarity for strategic allocation. By understanding the mechanics and history behind this index, investors can navigate the current Bitcoin season with informed perspective, preparing portfolios for the eventual transition that historical cycles suggest will come. Monitoring this Altcoin Season Index, alongside fundamental on-chain metrics, remains essential for anyone engaged in the dynamic digital asset space. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index of 22 mean? An index reading of 22 means that only 22% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior 90 days. This falls far short of the 75% threshold needed to declare an “altcoin season,” indicating the market is currently in a phase strongly favoring Bitcoin. Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index in real-time, as it is calculated based on continuous price data for the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets) against Bitcoin’s performance. Q3: Can the market be in an altcoin season if Bitcoin’s price is also rising? Yes, absolutely. An altcoin season is defined by relative performance, not absolute price direction. During a true altcoin season, the majority of altcoins are rising at a significantly faster percentage rate than Bitcoin, even if Bitcoin itself is also in an uptrend. Q4: What are the main limitations of the Altcoin Season Index? The index focuses only on the top 100 assets by market cap, potentially missing trends in smaller-cap cryptocurrencies. It is also a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance and does not predict future movements. It should be used in conjunction with other fundamental and on-chain metrics. Q5: Does a low index reading mean all altcoins are performing poorly? Not necessarily. A low aggregate index reading can still coincide with strong performance in specific altcoin sectors or individual projects. It indicates that outperformance is not broad-based across the major assets, but niche areas like AI-driven tokens or specific layer-1 platforms may still be rallying independently.

This rapid liquidation event, occurring across multiple trading platforms, represents one of the most substantial hourly derivatives market contractions in recent months. According to aggregated exchange data, the total futures liquidation volume reached $257 million over the preceding 24-hour period, indicating sustained market pressure. Market analysts immediately began examining the underlying causes and potential implications for both institutional and retail traders navigating this volatile landscape. Crypto Futures Liquidated: Understanding the Market Mechanics Futures contracts represent binding agreements to buy or sell assets at predetermined prices on specific future dates. Traders utilize leverage, essentially borrowed capital, to amplify potential returns from price movements. Consequently, exchanges implement automatic liquidation protocols when positions approach critical loss thresholds. These protocols trigger forced position closures to prevent traders from losing more than their initial collateral. The recent $117 million liquidation event primarily affected long positions , where traders bet on price increases. Market data reveals Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives accounted for approximately 68% of the total liquidated value. This concentration highlights the outsized influence these major cryptocurrencies maintain within derivatives markets. Historical analysis demonstrates that significant liquidation clusters often precede or accompany substantial price corrections. For instance, similar events occurred during the May 2021 market downturn and the November 2022 FTX collapse aftermath. Market surveillance platforms recorded the most substantial liquidations on Binance, Bybit, and OKX exchanges. These platforms collectively handle the majority of global cryptocurrency derivatives trading volume. The rapid succession of liquidations created a cascading effect , where forced selling contributed to further price declines, triggering additional liquidations. This phenomenon, sometimes called a “liquidation spiral,” represents a critical risk factor in highly leveraged markets. Analyzing the Causes Behind Derivatives Market Volatility Multiple converging factors typically precipitate substantial liquidation events in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. First, unexpected price movements trigger margin calls when leveraged positions approach their liquidation prices. Second, increased market volatility elevates the probability of positions hitting these critical thresholds. Third, reduced liquidity during certain trading periods can exacerbate price swings. Current market analysis suggests several specific triggers contributed to today’s event. Regulatory announcements from multiple jurisdictions created uncertainty about future compliance requirements. Additionally, macroeconomic data releases influenced broader financial market sentiment, affecting cryptocurrency correlations with traditional assets. Technical analysis reveals that Bitcoin’s price approached several key support levels before the liquidation surge. These levels often concentrate stop-loss orders and liquidation triggers. When the price breached these technical thresholds, it activated a chain reaction of automated selling. The table below illustrates the distribution of liquidations across major cryptocurrencies during the peak hour: Cryptocurrency Liquidated Value (USD) Percentage of Total Primary Direction Bitcoin (BTC) $63 million 54% Long Ethereum (ETH) $17 million 14% Long Solana (SOL) $12 million 10% Mixed Other Altcoins $25 million 22% Predominantly Long Exchange representatives have confirmed their systems operated normally throughout the volatility. They emphasized that liquidation mechanisms functioned as designed to maintain market integrity. However, the concentration of liquidations within a narrow timeframe underscores the interconnected nature of modern cryptocurrency markets. Automated trading systems and algorithmic strategies can amplify price movements during periods of stress. Market participants must therefore implement robust risk management strategies when engaging with leveraged products. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure and Risk Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency derivatives emphasize several key considerations. First, leverage ratios directly influence liquidation probabilities. Higher leverage requires smaller adverse price movements to trigger margin calls. Second, market depth determines how significantly large liquidations impact prices. Thinner order books typically experience more pronounced price slippage during forced selling. Third, cross-margin and isolated margin arrangements offer different risk profiles for traders. Industry experts recommend several practices for navigating volatile derivatives markets: Implement conservative leverage : Using lower leverage ratios reduces liquidation risk during normal volatility Monitor funding rates : Sustained positive funding rates can indicate overcrowded long positions Diversify across exchanges : Spreading positions can mitigate platform-specific risks Utilize stop-loss orders strategically : Proper placement can prevent unexpected liquidations Maintain adequate collateral buffers : Additional margin provides protection against volatility Historical data analysis reveals patterns in liquidation events. Typically, clusters occur during periods of: Major regulatory announcements Significant macroeconomic data releases Technical breakdowns of key price levels Exchange-specific issues or outages Large, unexpected wallet movements Market surveillance firms track liquidation metrics as indicators of market stress. The estimated leverage ratio and open interest provide insights into market positioning. When open interest declines alongside prices during liquidations, it often signals position unwinding rather than simple profit-taking. Current metrics suggest the market absorbed the $117 million liquidation without systemic issues. However, the event serves as a reminder of the inherent risks in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis The cryptocurrency derivatives market has evolved significantly since Bitcoin futures launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. Initially, liquidation events frequently exceeded $1 billion during major market corrections. Market structure improvements and increased liquidity have generally reduced the frequency of such extreme events. However, the potential for rapid liquidations remains inherent to leveraged trading. Comparative analysis reveals today’s event ranks among the top 15 hourly liquidation events over the past three years. The most substantial recorded liquidation occurred in June 2022, exceeding $1 billion in a single hour during the Celsius Network crisis. Market participants have developed more sophisticated risk management tools since earlier liquidation events. Exchanges now offer: Advanced order types for precise position management Real-time liquidation price calculators Risk indicators and market sentiment tools Educational resources on derivatives trading mechanics Regulatory developments continue shaping the derivatives landscape. Jurisdictions increasingly focus on investor protection measures for leveraged products. Some regions have implemented leverage limits for retail traders, while others require enhanced risk disclosures. These regulatory changes aim to reduce excessive risk-taking while maintaining market functionality. The evolving regulatory environment represents a significant factor for derivatives market participants worldwide. Conclusion The $117 million crypto futures liquidated within one hour highlights the ongoing volatility and risk inherent in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. This event demonstrates how leveraged positions can rapidly unwind during price movements, creating cascading effects across exchanges. Market participants must understand liquidation mechanisms and implement appropriate risk management strategies. Historical context reveals that while such events create short-term turbulence, markets typically absorb them without long-term structural damage. Continued market evolution, including regulatory developments and improved risk tools, may reduce the frequency and severity of extreme liquidation events. However, the fundamental relationship between leverage, volatility, and liquidation risk remains a permanent feature of derivatives trading across all asset classes. FAQs Q1: What causes futures liquidations in cryptocurrency markets? Liquidations occur when leveraged positions lose enough value that they approach their liquidation price. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent losses exceeding the trader’s collateral, particularly during rapid price movements. Q2: How does a $117 million liquidation compare to historical events? While substantial, this event ranks moderately compared to historical extremes. The largest recorded hourly liquidation exceeded $1 billion in June 2022. Market structure improvements have generally reduced the frequency of billion-dollar liquidation events. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies were most affected by these liquidations? Bitcoin derivatives accounted for approximately 54% ($63 million) of the liquidated value, followed by Ethereum at 14% ($17 million). Solana and other altcoins comprised the remaining 32% of liquidations. Q4: Do liquidation events indicate market manipulation? Not necessarily. While market manipulation can trigger liquidations, most events result from normal volatility, technical breakdowns, or macroeconomic factors. Regulators and exchanges monitor for manipulative activities during volatile periods. Q5: How can traders protect against unexpected liquidations? Traders can use conservative leverage, maintain collateral buffers, employ strategic stop-loss orders, diversify across exchanges, and monitor market indicators like funding rates and open interest to manage liquidation risk.

This potential Venezuela Bitcoin president scenario represents a seismic shift for a nation grappling with hyperinflation and economic collapse, potentially positioning cryptocurrency at the center of national recovery efforts. Venezuela Bitcoin President Contender Emerges from Political Upheaval The political landscape in Venezuela transformed overnight following the detention of President Nicolás Maduro on international charges. Consequently, opposition figures previously marginalized or exiled now find themselves at the forefront of potential leadership transitions. Specifically, Maria Corina Machado, a 56-year-old human rights activist and political leader, has gained significant attention. According to Cointelegraph’s reporting, Machado represents a unique fusion of traditional political activism and innovative economic thinking. Her 2024 Nobel Peace Prize recognition for humanitarian work during Venezuela’s crisis provides international credibility. Meanwhile, her vocal advocacy for Bitcoin as an economic solution distinguishes her from conventional candidates. Prediction markets currently reflect this shifting reality. The U.S.-based platform Kalshi assigns Machado a 28% probability of becoming Venezuela’s next leader. This places her second only to Edmundo González Urrutia, who holds a 32% probability. González Urrutia, another opposition figure, contested last year’s presidential election before entering exile amid fraud allegations. The narrow margin between these two contenders suggests a highly competitive political environment. Furthermore, it highlights how cryptocurrency policy has become a defining issue in Venezuela’s future direction. Bitcoin as Economic Lifeline in Hyperinflation Crisis Venezuela’s economic collapse provides crucial context for understanding Machado’s cryptocurrency advocacy. The country has experienced one of modern history’s most severe hyperinflation episodes. The International Monetary Fund reported annual inflation exceeding 1,000,000% in recent years. This economic devastation has eroded savings, destroyed purchasing power, and created widespread poverty. In response, many Venezuelans have turned to alternative financial systems. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained significant adoption as stores of value and means of transaction. Machado has consistently framed Bitcoin as more than just digital currency. She describes it as a “technology for freedom” that could address systemic economic problems. Her platform emphasizes three specific mechanisms through which cryptocurrency could benefit Venezuela: Property Rights Protection: Blockchain technology creates immutable records of ownership Inflation Resistance: Bitcoin’s fixed supply contrasts with bolívar’s unlimited printing Equal Opportunity Access: Digital wallets require only internet access, not traditional banking These proposals resonate with citizens who have experienced financial exclusion and currency devaluation. Additionally, they align with broader trends in developing economies where cryptocurrency adoption often correlates with economic instability. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency in Venezuela Venezuela’s relationship with cryptocurrency predates current political developments. The Maduro government launched the Petro cryptocurrency in 2018, though this state-backed digital currency faced international sanctions and limited adoption. Meanwhile, organic Bitcoin usage grew significantly among the population. Chainalysis data from 2023 ranked Venezuela third globally in cryptocurrency adoption relative to wealth and population. This existing infrastructure could facilitate policy implementation should a pro-Bitcoin candidate assume power. Political Landscape and Leadership Probabilities The current leadership probabilities reveal Venezuela’s complex political dynamics. The following table compares the two leading contenders according to Kalshi prediction markets: Candidate Probability Key Characteristics Cryptocurrency Position Edmundo González Urrutia 32% Traditional opposition leader, exiled after election fraud allegations No public cryptocurrency statements Maria Corina Machado 28% Nobel Peace Prize laureate, human rights activist, economic innovator Pro-Bitcoin platform emphasizing economic freedom This four-percentage-point difference indicates substantial uncertainty about Venezuela’s political future. Moreover, it suggests that cryptocurrency policy could become a decisive factor in any election or transition process. International observers closely monitor these developments because Venezuela represents a potential test case for cryptocurrency integration at the national level. Global Implications of Cryptocurrency Political Leadership A potential Venezuela Bitcoin president carries significance beyond national borders. Several countries with economic challenges observe Venezuela’s experiment with interest. El Salvador established precedent in 2021 by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. However, a major economy like Venezuela embracing cryptocurrency would represent a different scale of adoption. Financial analysts note that Venezuela possesses the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Therefore, any cryptocurrency integration could involve energy production considerations. International reactions to these developments remain mixed. The United States government has not commented specifically on Machado’s cryptocurrency proposals. However, previous statements indicate concern about cryptocurrency use evading sanctions. Conversely, cryptocurrency advocates globally celebrate the possibility of national-level adoption. Industry leaders emphasize that Venezuela’s situation demonstrates cryptocurrency’s practical utility in crisis conditions. This real-world validation could influence policy debates in other nations experiencing economic stress. Expert Perspectives on Economic Transition Economic analysts provide cautious assessments of cryptocurrency integration scenarios. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a Latin American economics specialist at Georgetown University, notes: “Venezuela requires comprehensive monetary reform. Cryptocurrency could play a role in this process, but it cannot single-handedly solve structural economic problems. Successful implementation would require careful regulation, financial education, and infrastructure development.” This perspective highlights the complexity of national cryptocurrency adoption. It also underscores that political leadership represents only one component of successful economic transformation. Conclusion The emergence of Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado as a leading Venezuela Bitcoin president contender marks a pivotal moment in global cryptocurrency evolution. Her candidacy represents the intersection of political change, economic crisis, and technological innovation. While prediction markets currently show a competitive race, the mere possibility of cryptocurrency-focused leadership in a major economy signals shifting global attitudes. Venezuela’s experience with hyperinflation and financial exclusion provides unique context for Bitcoin advocacy. Ultimately, the nation’s political direction will influence not only its citizens but also international perceptions of cryptocurrency’s role in national economies. The coming months will determine whether Venezuela becomes the world’s most significant test case for cryptocurrency integration at the sovereign level. FAQs Q1: What makes Maria Corina Machado’s candidacy significant for cryptocurrency? Machado represents the first major political candidate explicitly advocating Bitcoin as a national economic solution. Her Nobel Peace Prize recognition provides international credibility, while Venezuela’s hyperinflation crisis creates practical urgency for alternative financial systems. Q2: How has Bitcoin adoption progressed in Venezuela before this political development? Venezuela ranked third globally in cryptocurrency adoption relative to population and wealth in 2023. Many citizens use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to preserve savings and conduct transactions amid bolívar hyperinflation, creating existing infrastructure for potential policy implementation. Q3: What challenges would a pro-Bitcoin president face in Venezuela? Major challenges include international sanctions considerations, technological infrastructure limitations, financial literacy gaps, potential opposition from traditional financial institutions, and the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks alongside cryptocurrency adoption. Q4: How does Machado’s probability compare to other candidates? Prediction markets currently assign Machado a 28% probability versus 32% for frontrunner Edmundo González Urrutia. This narrow margin indicates competitive uncertainty, with cryptocurrency policy potentially becoming a decisive factor in Venezuela’s political future. Q5: What broader implications might Venezuela’s cryptocurrency direction have globally? Venezuela represents a potential test case for cryptocurrency integration at national scale in a major economy. Successful implementation could influence policy in other developing nations experiencing economic instability, while also shaping international regulatory discussions about cryptocurrency’s role in sovereign finance.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier cryptocurrency reached a price of $93,014.62 on the Binance USDT trading pair. This price movement, recorded on April 10, 2025, marks a key moment in the ongoing evolution of the crypto market and invites a deeper analysis of the underlying factors and potential implications. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Psychological Barrier The ascent past $93,000 represents more than a numerical achievement. Consequently, it serves as a powerful psychological signal to the global investment community. Market analysts immediately scrutinized trading volumes and order book depth for confirmation. Historically, such round-number levels often act as both resistance and support. Therefore, a clean break can trigger further momentum. The move was characterized by steady buying pressure rather than a speculative spike. This suggests a degree of institutional confidence often absent in more volatile rallies. For context, Bitcoin’s journey to this point has been multifaceted. The asset recovered from a significant bear market in the preceding years. Its performance often correlates with macro-economic factors like inflation data and monetary policy. Furthermore, adoption metrics from both retail and corporate entities show consistent growth. This price level reactivates discussions about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a digital store of value. Analyzing the Current Cryptocurrency Rally Bitcoin’s surge does not exist in a vacuum. The broader digital asset market frequently experiences correlated movements. However, Bitcoin often leads the trend. Several concurrent factors provide context for this rally: Institutional Inflows: Recent filings with regulatory bodies show increased exposure from traditional finance firms. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in key jurisdictions has reduced uncertainty for large investors. Network Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s hash rate, a measure of network security, remains near all-time highs. Macroeconomic Hedge: Some investors continue to view crypto as a hedge against currency devaluation. Market sentiment, as measured by several established indices, shifted from neutral to cautiously optimistic in the weeks preceding this move. Trading activity on both spot and derivatives markets increased notably. This indicates participation from diverse trader profiles. Importantly, the rally has so far avoided the hallmarks of excessive leverage that characterized past bubbles. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure Financial analysts emphasize the changing nature of Bitcoin demand. A decade ago, retail speculation dominated price discovery. Today, the landscape includes: Participant Type Primary Influence Typical Time Horizon Long-Term Holders Supply Reduction Years Institutional Funds Large Volume Orders Months to Years Active Traders Short-Term Volatility Days to Weeks Corporate Treasuries Strategic Allocation Indefinite This diversified base potentially contributes to more stable price appreciation. Experts from major financial research firms point to on-chain data. This data shows coins moving from exchanges to long-term storage solutions. Such movement typically reduces immediate sell-side pressure. Meanwhile, the development of regulated financial products continues to bridge traditional and crypto finance. Historical Context and Future Trajectories Understanding this $93,000 price requires a look at Bitcoin’s history. The asset has experienced multiple cycles of expansion and contraction. Each cycle reached a new nominal high, though the rate of growth has moderated over time. Previous all-time highs, such as those near $69,000, became consolidation zones before the next advance. The current macroeconomic environment differs markedly from past cycles. Global debt levels, interest rate policies, and geopolitical tensions create a unique backdrop. Technological developments also play a crucial role. The Bitcoin network has undergone several major upgrades. These upgrades improve scalability and programmability without compromising its core security model. The ecosystem of layer-two solutions, like the Lightning Network, now facilitates faster and cheaper transactions. This practical utility supports the asset’s valuation beyond pure speculation. Consequently, analysts assess price targets not just on historical patterns but on these evolving fundamentals. The Impact on the Broader Digital Asset Ecosystem Bitcoin’s performance invariably influences the entire cryptocurrency sector. Often termed ‘digital gold,’ its price strength can boost sentiment across the board. However, the relationship is not always linear. Some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) may outperform in a strong Bitcoin market, while others may lag. This period has seen selective capital rotation. Investors appear to be rewarding projects with clear utility and sustainable tokenomics. The total market capitalization of all crypto assets has increased in tandem with Bitcoin’s rise. This reinforces the notion of Bitcoin as a market bellwether. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $93,000 signifies a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency market. This milestone, driven by a complex mix of institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors, and strong network fundamentals, underscores the asset’s maturing role in global finance. While price movements attract headlines, the underlying story involves technological progress and shifting investor demographics. The Bitcoin price at this level reflects a market that is increasingly integrated with traditional finance yet remains distinct in its potential. Observers will now monitor whether this level consolidates as a new support zone, setting the stage for the next phase of the digital asset evolution. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $93,000 mean for the average investor? It primarily indicates heightened mainstream and institutional attention. For an average investor, it underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s volatility and conducting thorough research before considering any allocation, no matter how small. Q2: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $93,000 level represents a new all-time high in nominal terms, surpassing the previous record set in the last market cycle. In inflation-adjusted terms, comparisons depend on the chosen benchmark currency and timeframe. Q3: What are the main risks associated with Bitcoin at this price level? Key risks include high volatility, regulatory changes in major economies, technological risks (though minimal for Bitcoin’s base layer), macroeconomic shifts that reduce its appeal as a hedge, and potential market corrections after rapid appreciation. Q4: Does a high Bitcoin price affect transaction fees and speed? The Bitcoin price itself does not directly affect network fees or transaction speed. These are determined by network congestion and the fee market. However, periods of high price often coincide with increased network usage, which can raise fees. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data on Bitcoin’s price and market metrics? Reliable data comes from transparent, high-volume exchanges (like the Binance USDT market cited), aggregated price indices from sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, and on-chain analytics platforms that track network fundamentals beyond just price.

This substantial transaction, identified by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, highlights the evolving financial strategies of major industry players. Consequently, it provides a tangible case study in corporate Bitcoin treasury management. The transfer occurred amidst a period of relative stability for the flagship cryptocurrency. Therefore, analysts are scrutinizing the move for potential signals about institutional liquidity needs and market-making activities. Analyzing the MARA Holdings Bitcoin Transfer The transaction originated from a digital wallet address widely associated with MARA Holdings’ corporate treasury. Blockchain data confirms the transfer of exactly 288 BTC to a destination wallet tagged to Wintermute Trading. Market makers like Wintermute provide essential liquidity to cryptocurrency exchanges. They facilitate smoother trading by continuously quoting buy and sell prices. This specific transfer likely represents a strategic allocation for liquidity provision or over-the-counter (OTC) trading purposes. MARA Holdings, formally known as Marathon Digital Holdings, operates as one of the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies in North America. The company follows a strategy of holding a significant portion of the Bitcoin it mines. This approach turns it into a notable corporate holder of the digital asset. Regular transactions from its treasury are common. However, transfers of this scale to a specific market maker warrant closer examination for their market implications. Context and Implications for Crypto Markets This transaction occurs within a broader context of increasing institutional involvement in cryptocurrency markets. Large transfers between established entities often precede or coincide with heightened trading activity. For instance, market makers require substantial capital reserves to fulfill their role effectively. A direct infusion of Bitcoin from a miner can streamline this process. It avoids the need for intermediate steps on public exchanges, which could cause price slippage. Expert Perspective on Treasury Management Industry analysts frequently monitor wallets of public mining companies like MARA Holdings. Their transactions offer insights into corporate strategy and market sentiment. A transfer to a market maker, rather than a direct sale on an exchange, suggests a desire for efficient execution. It may also indicate preparation for facilitating large client orders or hedging activities. According to common treasury management principles, such moves are often planned to minimize market impact. They reflect a sophisticated approach to handling digital asset reserves. The following table outlines key details of the transaction as reported: Metric Detail Sending Entity Presumed MARA Holdings Treasury Wallet Receiving Entity Wintermute Trading Wallet Amount (BTC) 288 Approximate USD Value $26.3 Million Data Source Lookonchain Blockchain Analytics Timeframe Approximately 9 hours prior to report Several potential motivations could explain this Bitcoin transfer: Liquidity Provision: Wintermute may use the BTC to bolster quotes on various trading platforms. OTC Desk Supply: The coins could supply an over-the-counter desk for large institutional trades. Collateral for Derivatives: The Bitcoin might serve as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) or futures markets. Strategic Rebalancing: MARA Holdings could be actively managing its treasury assets. The Role of Market Makers Like Wintermute Wintermute operates as a leading global algorithmic trading firm specializing in digital assets. The company’s core function involves providing liquidity across numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and trading venues. This activity is crucial for a healthy market. It reduces the spread between buy and sell orders, which ultimately lowers costs for all traders. Receiving a direct transfer from a primary source like a miner is efficient. It allows Wintermute to source assets without affecting the public order books. Furthermore, such partnerships between miners and market makers are becoming more formalized. They represent a maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s infrastructure. Miners gain a reliable channel for monetizing their mined coins with minimal disruption. Simultaneously, market makers secure a direct supply of assets. This symbiotic relationship supports overall market stability and efficiency. Impact on Bitcoin Network and Miner Behavior Transactions of this size are routine for the Bitcoin network, which easily handles much larger value transfers daily. However, they are significant within the context of miner economics. Public mining companies face constant scrutiny from shareholders regarding their Bitcoin holdings and sales strategies. A transparent, strategic transfer to a known counterparty like Wintermute can be viewed as a responsible treasury action. It contrasts with panic selling during market downturns, which can exacerbate price declines. Monitoring these flows helps analysts gauge selling pressure from miners. If many large miners began moving coins to exchanges en masse, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially impacting price. Conversely, a transfer to a market maker is more neutral. It indicates operational activity rather than a direct bearish sentiment. This distinction is important for accurate market analysis. Conclusion The $26.3 million Bitcoin transfer from MARA Holdings to Wintermute underscores the sophisticated financial operations now commonplace in the cryptocurrency sector. This transaction reflects a strategic move for liquidity management rather than a simple asset sale. It highlights the deepening integration between Bitcoin mining operations and secondary market infrastructure. As the industry evolves, such transparent, large-scale transfers between credible entities will likely become more frequent. They demonstrate the professionalization of digital asset treasury management. Ultimately, this MARA Holdings Bitcoin transfer serves as a marker of the market’s ongoing maturation and institutional confidence. FAQs Q1: What is the significance of MARA Holdings transferring BTC to Wintermute? This transfer is significant because it involves a major public Bitcoin miner moving a large sum directly to a leading market maker. It suggests a strategic partnership for liquidity provision, highlighting how large players manage digital treasuries efficiently outside of public exchanges. Q2: Does this Bitcoin transfer indicate MARA Holdings is selling its Bitcoin? Not necessarily. A transfer to a market maker like Wintermute is different from a direct sale on an exchange. Wintermute likely uses the BTC to provide trading liquidity or facilitate large OTC trades. The move is more about treasury management and operational efficiency than an outright sale. Q3: How do analysts track transactions like this? Analysts use blockchain explorers and analytics platforms like Lookonchain, which tag wallet addresses associated with known entities (e.g., companies, exchanges). By monitoring flows to and from these tagged addresses, they can infer institutional activity and market trends. Q4: What is a crypto market maker, and what does Wintermute do? A crypto market maker is a firm that provides liquidity by continuously placing buy and sell orders on exchanges. Wintermute is a major algorithmic trading firm that performs this role, helping to ensure markets are deep and stable for all participants by narrowing bid-ask spreads. Q5: Could this large transfer affect the price of Bitcoin? A direct transfer between two private entities typically has no immediate direct impact on the public market price. The impact would occur if Wintermute used the coins to execute large sell orders on exchanges. The strategic nature of this transfer aims to minimize such market disruption.

Livingston made this statement after discovering that Japan’s total debt , in comparison to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), is approximately 250%, marking a substantial rise in Japan’s debt level in its history. At this high level, reports highlighted that the yen continues to weaken, as the government is required to print a considerable amount of money every year to address deficits, which causes heavier debt and lowers the yen’s value. Livingston points out the impacts of a weaker yen on the industry Reports from reliable sources indicate that the value of Bitcoin has increased by approximately 1,159% since 2020. This rise was identified when the cryptocurrency’s value was measured in US dollars. Nonetheless, Livingston noted that BTC’s increase is approximately 1,704% compared to the Japanese yen. Concerning the claim that Metaplanet might enjoy financial advantages over other firms, analysts began by acknowledging that if the yen is weaker, the company’s debts are tied to a currency with less value than the dollar. This situation makes financing readily available for Metaplanet at an affordable cost for each unit of fiat currency it utilizes. Another discovery that was made public was the fact that Metaplanet makes payments for each coupon using a currency whose value is diminishing compared to that of BTC and USD. Consequently, the real cost of its 4.9% coupon in Bitcoin continues to decrease while Strategy makes payments of its 10% coupon in dollars, utilizing a stronger currency; hence, the firm’s liabilities decline at a slow pace. It is worth noting that this analysis was conducted during a global decline in crypto treasury firms. Some of these companies have observed a decrease in their values of more than 90% from their peak. The crypto markets, on the other hand, are facing difficulties recovering and achieving new highs after a major crash in October 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Treasuries data disclosed that Metaplanet currently owns approximately 35,102 BTC in reserve. With this achievement, the company solidified its position among the top-ranked firms as the fourth-largest Bitcoin treasury company, measured by its Bitcoin holdings. For its latest purchase, sources mentioned that the firm bought approximately 4,279 units of BTC on Tuesday of last week, adding to its reserve for around $451 million. However, the current situation in the company has sparked heated debates among individuals who have raised concerns, wondering why Metaplanet’s stock price has dropped despite making such a significant move in its Bitcoin purchase. Additionally, they observed that the rest of the crypto treasury sector also declined. This sector comprises key players in the industry, such as Strategy — the largest BTC treasury company — BitMine, Nakamoto, and others. Metaplanet implements a significant move in the crypto space In December 2025, Metaplanet made several amendments to its capital structure. This move made it easier for Japan’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin to collect funds by issuing preferred shares that pay dividends, drawing the attention of several institutional investors. As a result of this change, Dylan LeClair, the company’s director of Bitcoin strategy, noted that investors supported five proposals that collectively enhanced Metaplanet’s ability to offer preferred shares, introduce new dividend alternatives, and attract participation from international institutional investors. Notably, this approved adjustment involves reclassifying capital reserves to facilitate the payment of preferred share dividends and potentially repurchasing shares.

Griggs said the company decided to go in after the Trump administration put out clear rules and brought in regulators who support crypto. “PwC has to be in that ecosystem,” Griggs told the Financial Times. The full pivot happened in 2024 after regulators changed and Congress passed new crypto laws. Griggs said the Genius Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, gave the company and others legal clarity for the first time. The law regulates stablecoins and opens the way for banks to issue their own. That legal change, paired with Trump’s appointment of Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, gave Big Four companies like PwC the signal to stop sitting out. The Biden-era hostility toward crypto is now gone. PwC now advises crypto clients on audits, taxes, and payments Griggs said the company feels “a responsibility to be hyper-engaged on both sides of the business,” adding: “Whether we are doing work in the audit space or doing work in the consulting arena — we do all the above in crypto — we see more and more opportunities coming our way.” Griggs also said the company now offers full crypto services, from accounting to strategy. Until now, PwC and the rest of the Big Four were reluctant to take on crypto companies in the US.They put up high barriers and turned down most of them.That was partly because US regulators were skeptical of the entire industry, constantly concerned about fraud, money laundering, and consumer risks. But with the Trump administration now backing the space, those companies are treating crypto like any other line of business. Griggs said PwC has been pitching to clients how they can use crypto tools to make things work better, especially around payments.He said stablecoins are one way to make payments faster and more efficient. This pitch comes as companies scramble to find new ways to cut costs and speed up operations, especially with banking rails still outdated. Other Big Four companies aren’t waiting around either. Deloitte has been auditing Coinbase since 2020 and put out a full crypto accounting guide in May. KPMG called 2025 the “tipping point” for crypto and now sells compliance and risk advisory tied to crypto use. All of them are now targeting this once-taboo industry for serious money. PwC expands crypto hires and lands big clients like Mara Griggs also revealed that PwC has already picked up audit clients in the crypto industry. That includes Mara Holdings, a bitcoin mining company that appointed the company in March. He said the company is also offering crypto tax advice, helping clients figure out how to handle digital income, transactions, and legal structures under the new US laws. Griggs was promoted to US senior partner in 2024 after working at PwC for nearly 30 years. He used to handle the audit for Goldman Sachs and also ran some of the company’s internal talent programs. Now he’s trying to make sure PwC doesn’t fall behind in a growing part of the market. To do that, he said the company had to hire from outside.

This significant market movement was overwhelmingly dominated by the unraveling of short positions, signaling a powerful counter-trend rally that caught a vast number of traders on the wrong side of the market. The data reveals a clear narrative of a coordinated short squeeze impacting the flagship digital assets Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), with profound implications for market structure and trader sentiment moving forward. Crypto Liquidations Reach a Critical Mass The perpetual futures market, a cornerstone of cryptocurrency derivatives trading, experienced intense volatility. Consequently, exchanges automatically closed leveraged positions that fell below their maintenance margin requirements. This process, known as liquidation, protects lenders from losses but can exacerbate price movements. The aggregate value of $155 million is substantial, indicating a high degree of leverage was present in the market. Furthermore, the extreme skew toward short liquidations—where traders betting on price declines were forced to buy back assets—acted as a potent accelerant for the rally. This created a feedback loop; liquidations drove prices higher, triggering more liquidations. Market analysts often scrutinize liquidation clusters to gauge potential turning points. A cluster of short liquidations, as seen here, typically suggests that pessimistic sentiment had become overly crowded. When the market reverses, it triggers a cascade. Key metrics from this event include: Total Liquidations: $155 million across all cryptocurrencies. Short vs. Long Ratio: An overwhelming majority were short position liquidations. Market Impact: The forced buying from liquidations provided significant upward pressure on spot prices. Bitcoin Leads the Charge with $91.55M in Liquidations Bitcoin, the market’s primary benchmark, accounted for the lion’s share of the liquidation volume. Specifically, $91.55 million in BTC perpetual futures positions were wiped out. Astonishingly, short positions constituted 94.24% of this total. This translates to approximately $86.3 million in forced buying of Bitcoin as these leveraged shorts were closed. Such a lopsided figure highlights a massive misalignment between trader positioning and short-term price action. The scale of BTC short liquidations often serves as a catalyst for broader market movements, as Bitcoin’s dominance influences altcoin trajectories. The event coincided with several macroeconomic catalysts, including shifting expectations around central bank monetary policy and institutional accumulation patterns observed in on-chain data. Historically, similar short squeeze events in Bitcoin have preceded periods of sustained bullish momentum, as they effectively remove a key source of selling pressure and can force traders to reposition. The velocity of this move underscores the inherent risks of high leverage in an asset class known for its volatility. Ethereum and Solana Follow the Pattern The liquidation wave was not isolated to Bitcoin. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, mirrored the trend with $51.81 million in liquidations. Within this, short positions made up 85.67%, or about $44.4 million. This simultaneous squeeze across both major assets suggests a macro-driven shift in sentiment rather than an asset-specific issue. The Ethereum network’s ongoing developments, including progress on scalability upgrades, may have contributed to a fundamental reassessment by the market. Solana, a prominent layer-1 blockchain, also experienced significant pressure on its short sellers. SOL liquidations totaled $11.76 million, with a staggering 91.44% stemming from short positions. The high percentage indicates that short interest in SOL was particularly concentrated, making it vulnerable to a sharp reversal. This activity often reflects the higher beta nature of altcoins like Solana, which tend to experience amplified volatility relative to Bitcoin. 24-Hour Liquidation Snapshot (March 21, 2025) Asset Total Liquidations Short Percentage Short Value Bitcoin (BTC) $91.55M 94.24% ~$86.3M Ethereum (ETH) $51.81M 85.67% ~$44.4M Solana (SOL) $11.76M 91.44% ~$10.75M Market Total ~$155M Dominantly Short ~$141.5M Understanding the Mechanics of a Short Squeeze A short squeeze is a pivotal market phenomenon. It occurs when an asset’s price begins to rise rapidly, and traders who have borrowed and sold that asset (shorted it) face mounting losses. To limit these losses, they must buy the asset back to close their position. This mandatory buying adds further demand, pushing the price even higher and forcing more short sellers to cover. The perpetual futures market, with its high leverage and funding rate mechanism, is especially prone to these volatile cascades. The funding rate, a periodic payment between long and short positions, can turn sharply negative during strong rallies, increasing the cost for those holding shorts and hastening their exit. This recent event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with derivative trading. While leverage can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses and reduces a trader’s margin for error. Market infrastructure, including exchange risk engines and liquidity depth, is critically tested during such events. Regulators and institutional observers closely monitor these liquidations to assess systemic risk within the growing crypto derivatives ecosystem. Historical Context and Market Implications Comparable liquidation events have marked key inflection points in previous market cycles. For instance, significant short squeezes often cluster at the end of prolonged bearish trends, signaling capitulation from the downside. The scale of this event, while notable, remains below the historic liquidation spikes seen during the bull market of 2021 or the LUNA collapse of 2022, suggesting a more contained, albeit sharp, correction in positioning. The immediate implication is a reset of leverage in the system. A flush of short positions reduces immediate selling pressure and can pave the way for a more stable price advance. However, it also leaves the market potentially vulnerable to a long liquidation cascade if the price momentum reverses. Traders will now monitor open interest and funding rates to see if bullish leverage begins to build excessively, setting the stage for a potential long squeeze on any downturn. Expert Analysis on Derivative Market Health Derivatives analysts emphasize that while painful for affected traders, these periodic liquidations are a healthy mechanism for the market. They prevent unsustainable leverage from building indefinitely and help realign prices with underlying spot market flows. The dominance of short liquidations indicates that the market efficiently purged pessimistic bets, potentially creating a cleaner foundation for price discovery. Furthermore, the event demonstrates the increasing maturity of crypto derivatives markets, where large liquidations can occur without causing widespread exchange insolvencies or permanent market damage, a sign of improved risk management since earlier years. Conclusion The $155 million crypto liquidation event, overwhelmingly dominated by short positions, represents a significant market reset. The forceful squeeze across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana underscores the powerful dynamics of leveraged derivatives trading. This event removed a substantial layer of short-side pressure, potentially altering the near-term technical landscape. For market participants, it reinforces the critical importance of risk management, especially when utilizing leverage in a volatile asset class. As the market digests this move, attention will shift to whether this marks a sustainable shift in trend or a temporary volatility spike. The data on crypto liquidations provides a clear, quantitative snapshot of a day where the market forcefully corrected a major imbalance in trader sentiment. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a short position is liquidated? A1: A short position is liquidated when a trader who borrowed and sold an asset, betting its price would fall, experiences losses as the price rises. If the loss erodes their collateral (margin) below a required level, the exchange automatically buys back the asset to close the position, limiting further loss for the lender. This forced buying can push prices higher. Q2: Why are short liquidations considered bullish for the market? A2: Short liquidations are considered bullish in the short term because they involve mandatory buying to close positions. This buying pressure can accelerate a price rally. Furthermore, they eliminate a pool of traders expecting lower prices, reducing potential selling pressure once the rally begins. Q3: What is a perpetual futures contract? A3: A perpetual futures contract is a derivative product that allows traders to speculate on an asset’s price without an expiry date. Positions are maintained through a funding rate mechanism, where traders on one side of the market periodically pay those on the other side, ensuring the contract price stays anchored to the spot price. Q4: How can traders monitor liquidation risk? A4: Traders can monitor liquidation risk using tools that track aggregate leverage, funding rates, and liquidation price clusters across exchanges. High open interest combined with extreme funding rates or a large volume of positions with liquidation prices near the current market price indicates elevated risk of a squeeze. Q5: Did this liquidation event only affect retail traders? A5: While detailed breakdowns are not always public, liquidation events of this scale typically affect a mix of retail and institutional leveraged positions. The sheer volume suggests institutional desks and large whales were likely involved, not just retail traders.

The recovery in crypto came as investors weighed the implications of Washington’s move to seize control of the oil-rich nation. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,947, up 1.2% Ether : $3,163, up 0.4% XRP : $2.12, up 3.1% Total crypto market cap: $3.23 trillion, up 0.9% President Donald Trump said over the weekend that the US had placed Venezuela under temporary American control, following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. US authorities said Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were flown to New York and charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other crimes. An indictment alleged that drug trafficking had enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite. Oil Retreats As Traders Gauge Supply Fallout From Venezuela Crisis The sudden escalation rattled energy markets early in the session. Brent crude slid more than 1% at one point before trimming losses, and was last trading about 0.25% lower. West Texas Intermediate fell roughly 0.4% as traders assessed how the intervention could disrupt supply from a country that holds the world’s largest proven crude reserves.

This development emerges directly following the dramatic U.S. arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, triggering urgent questions about state-level crypto adoption for sanctions evasion. Meanwhile, confirmed on-chain data presents a far more modest public picture of just 240 BTC, creating a profound mystery that international investigators vow to unravel. Venezuela Bitcoin Mystery: The $60 Billion Speculation Financial analysts and blockchain investigators currently face a significant puzzle. Reports from Blockmedia and other financial intelligence outlets suggest Venezuela systematically accumulated Bitcoin and Tether over several years. The alleged purpose was creating a sovereign digital asset reserve completely outside the traditional global banking system. Consequently, this reserve could theoretically fund government operations and imports despite crippling international sanctions. However, these claims rely heavily on anonymous sources and analysis of opaque financial networks rather than transparent blockchain evidence. For context, a $60 billion Bitcoin holding would represent an unprecedented state crypto treasury. To illustrate, this amount would exceed the publicly disclosed foreign reserves of numerous nations. The speculation originates from tracing complex transactions through cryptocurrency exchanges and peer-to-peer platforms that allegedly serviced Venezuelan state entities. Furthermore, investigators point to the country’s early and aggressive promotion of the Petro, its national cryptocurrency, as evidence of institutional crypto expertise that could facilitate such accumulation. On-Chain Reality Versus Off-Chain Speculation The publicly verifiable data tells a markedly different story. Blockchain analysis firms confirm identifiable Venezuelan state wallets hold approximately 240 BTC, valued around $15 million at current prices. This glaring discrepancy between rumored billions and confirmed millions forms the core of the investigation. Experts propose several explanations for this data gap. Obfuscated Holdings: The state could use advanced techniques like chain-hopping, privacy coins, or custodial services to hide transactions. Private Key Distribution: Assets might be distributed across thousands of wallets under individual names rather than a single state wallet. Off-Chain Agreements: Holdings could exist as IOUs or balances on private, permissioned ledgers not visible on public blockchains. Exaggerated Estimates: The $60 billion figure might stem from miscalculated transaction volumes or intentional misinformation. Blockchain forensic analyst, Dr. Elena Torres, whose firm tracks state-level crypto activity, provided crucial insight. “The technical capability to obscure large-scale holdings absolutely exists,” Torres explained. “Nation-states now employ the same mixing services and decentralized exchanges that illicit actors use. Therefore, proving or disproving these claims requires subpoena power over global exchanges, not just blockchain analysis.” Geopolitical Context: Sanctions and Financial Survival Venezuela’s economic context makes cryptocurrency an attractive, albeit risky, tool. The United States and European Union imposed severe financial sanctions over the past decade, effectively locking the country out of the SWIFT banking network. These measures aimed to pressure the Maduro government on human rights and democratic standards. In response, Venezuela explored multiple financial alternatives. The timeline below shows key events leading to the current speculation: Year Event Cryptocurrency Relevance 2017 U.S. sanctions begin targeting Venezuelan state debt and oil revenue. Traditional dollar financing becomes inaccessible. 2018 Venezuela launches the ‘Petro’ (PTR), a state-backed cryptocurrency. First major state attempt to create a sanctions-proof digital currency. 2020 U.S. Treasury explicitly bans U.S. persons from transacting in the Petro. Forces Venezuela to seek more discreet crypto options like Bitcoin. 2023 Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volumes in Bolivars spike on local exchanges. Indicates growing domestic crypto adoption for inflation hedging. 2024 Reports emerge of state-owned oil company PDVSA accepting BTC for exports. Direct evidence of state-level Bitcoin adoption for trade. 2025 Arrest of Maduro; U.S. announces investigation into Venezuelan overseas assets. Current investigation launches, focusing on informal crypto networks. This historical pattern demonstrates a clear trajectory toward cryptocurrency as a sanctions evasion mechanism. The use of Tether (USDT) is particularly strategic because its stable value mirrors the U.S. dollar without requiring access to U.S. bank accounts. Essentially, it provides dollar liquidity on a blockchain. A former Venezuelan finance ministry official, speaking anonymously due to safety concerns, stated, “The operational shift toward crypto was not ideological but purely survivalist. When your banks are blocked, you find another network.” The U.S. Investigation and Global Implications The United States Department of Justice and Treasury Department now lead a coordinated investigation. Their mandate extends beyond Venezuela’s secret Bitcoin stash to map its entire “informal financial network.” This network reportedly includes cryptocurrency exchanges in Turkey, Russia, and Asia, as well as gold and diamond traders. The investigative challenge is monumental, involving multiple jurisdictions and rapidly evolving technology. This case sets several critical precedents for international finance and law: Sovereign Crypto Seizure: Can a nation’s cryptocurrency holdings be legally seized like traditional foreign reserves? Exchange Liability: What responsibility do global crypto exchanges bear for servicing sanctioned states? Blockchain as Evidence: How will courts treat blockchain forensic analysis as evidence of state ownership? Sanctions Efficacy: Do cryptocurrencies fundamentally undermine the power of economic sanctions? Legal scholar Professor Michael Chen, who specializes in crypto regulation, highlights the complexity. “This isn’t just about finding the private keys,” Chen notes. “It’s about establishing a legal theory that digital assets held in decentralized wallets constitute recoverable state property. Furthermore, it tests whether the ‘travel rule’ and KYC regulations have any real bite against determined state actors.” The outcome could reshape how sanctions are designed and enforced in the digital age. Market and Miner Reactions The speculation has triggered noticeable reactions within cryptocurrency markets and mining communities. Initially, some traders feared the potential market impact of a forced $60 billion liquidation if assets were seized and sold. However, most analysts consider this scenario extremely unlikely due to the logistical and legal hurdles. More tangibly, the situation has renewed scrutiny on Bitcoin mining in Venezuela. For years, Venezuela hosted mining operations leveraging its heavily subsidized electricity. The government alternately embraced and cracked down on miners. If a state-controlled mining operation existed, it could provide a steady, off-the-books Bitcoin supply. Energy sector reports suggest specific industrial zones with protected power supplies could support large-scale mining. This possibility adds another layer to the investigation, turning physical infrastructure into a potential clue. Conclusion The mystery of Venezuela’s secret Bitcoin stash remains unresolved, suspended between unverified speculation and confirmed on-chain data. The core issue transcends the specific $60 billion figure, focusing instead on the demonstrated use of cryptocurrency by a nation-state to circumvent international isolation. The ongoing U.S. investigation will likely provide definitive answers, with profound implications for financial sovereignty, sanctions policy, and global cryptocurrency regulation. Regardless of the final tally, the case already proves that digital assets have become a serious tool in geopolitical conflict, moving far beyond their origins as a niche technological experiment. FAQs Q1: What is the evidence for Venezuela’s $60 billion Bitcoin stash? The evidence is currently circumstantial and based on financial intelligence reports. It includes analysis of transaction patterns, reports from defectors, and the country’s known motivation and technical capacity. Public blockchain records, however, show only minimal confirmed holdings. Q2: Why would Venezuela use Bitcoin instead of other assets? Bitcoin is borderless, censorship-resistant, and can be stored without reliance on any other country’s banking system. This makes it uniquely suited for a nation facing comprehensive international financial sanctions that freeze its traditional foreign reserves. Q3: How does Tether (USDT) fit into this situation? Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. It allows Venezuela to hold and transact in a dollar-equivalent digital asset without needing a U.S. bank account, providing stable value for trade settlements while evading banking channel blocks. Q4: Can the U.S. actually seize Venezuela’s cryptocurrency? Technically, it is possible if investigators can identify the custody solution (like a specific wallet or exchange account) and gain control of the private keys. Legally, it would require establishing that the assets are indeed state property subject to seizure under sanctions laws, a novel and untested area of international law. Q5: What impact has this speculation had on Bitcoin’s price? The direct market impact has been minimal. Most market participants view the $60 billion figure with skepticism, and the logistical barriers to a forced liquidation of such a hypothetical stash are considered too high to pose a credible threat to market stability.

Paul Griggs, PwC’s US senior partner, told the Financial Times the firm decided to “lean in” as Washington installed pro-crypto regulators and Congress advanced new rules for parts of the market that banks and blue-chip companies watch closely. The change lands as stablecoins move from a niche tool for crypto traders toward mainstream payment plumbing. Stablecoin Law And SEC Direction Pull Crypto Closer To Wall Street President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July 2025 , setting a federal framework for regulating payment stablecoins and opening the door for banks to issue their own tokens. “The Genius Act and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class,” Griggs said. “The tokenization of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem.” Regulation is also shifting at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chair Paul Atkins has said he wants clearer, more predictable rules for crypto markets, and Reuters reported the agency is working on new approaches for how tokens are issued, held and traded. PwC sits at the centre of that demand because it is one of the world’s largest professional services networks, best known for auditing public companies and advising executives on tax, deals, controls and risk. Regulatory Comfort Spurs Demand For Audits And Token Expertise As crypto products move into regulated finance, clients need auditors who can test reserves, governance and disclosure, and consultants who can map how tokenized cash and tokenized assets flow through real-world systems. Until recently, the Big Four kept higher hurdles for many crypto clients in the US, in part because regulators signalled skepticism and the sector carried reputational risk after repeated blowups. Watchdogs have also long flagged consumer protection concerns and the use of digital assets in fraud and money laundering. With the US policy mood turning friendlier, Griggs said PwC has been pitching crypto tech as a practical upgrade for payments, with stablecoins framed as a way to make transfers faster and cheaper in certain corridors. PwC Builds Crypto Bench Strength To Support New Clients PwC is also taking on audit work in the sector. Mara Holdings, a publicly traded bitcoin miner, appointed PwC as its auditor for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2025, according to a company filing. Griggs said PwC also had to build capability before taking on more work, including senior hires such as Cheryl Lesnik. “We are never going to lean into a business that we haven’t equipped ourselves to deliver,” he told the FT. “Over the last 10 to 12 months, as we’ve taken on more opportunities in that digital assets arena, we’ve bolstered our resource pool inside and outside.” The push is not happening in isolation. Deloitte has audited Coinbase since 2020, and KPMG has also been marketing digital asset compliance and risk services, as the Big Four position for a market where tokenization and regulated stablecoins pull traditional finance closer to crypto rails.

Lopp said the latest bump was even more surprising, given that mailing list traffic had slumped the previous year after the platform migrated from Linux Foundation servers to Google Groups. The number of contributors has also continued to grow, with 135 individuals contributing to Bitcoin Core in 2025 compared to approximately 112 the previous year. Loop says BTC Core developers modified about 285,000 lines in 2026 Despite the increase in activity , overall code changes remained steady, with about 285,000 lines modified during the year versus 276,000 the year before, Lopp reported. In November, Bitcoin Core also wrapped up its first publicly disclosed third-party security audit, led by Quarkslab and funded by Brink, which found no critical or high-severity flaws in the project’s peer-to-peer networking layer. Moreover, funding for Bitcoin Core development remains steady so far, with VanEck pledging 5% of the profits from its spot Bitcoin ETF to Brink. Meanwhile, in an October report, 1A1z found that Bitcoin Core had approximately 41 developers, excluding test engineers, researchers, and related protocols such as Lightning Network and Nostr, as well as the closely connected libsecp256k1 library. The report also compared Web3 developments for comparison. Polkadot , meanwhile, spent $7 million in 2023 on core development with a market cap of merely 1.2 percent of Bitcoin’s. It had boosted its spending to $16.8 million in 2024. Ethereum’s core developer costs: $32.3 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024, and Bitcoin: around $840 million. Crypto Fear and Greed Index is at a “neutral” 40 For the first time since October, CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Fear and Greed Index also reached a “neutral” reading on Sunday, signaling a potential easing of investor fear. At 40, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index suggests that investors are neither overly fearful nor bullish. Crypto market confidence declined heavily sometime in November, with the index hitting its lowest reading of 2025, at 10, indicating “extreme fear.” Similarly, in October, crypto investor confidence in the crypto market had sunk as a major market crash disrupted the bull run. Bitcoin’s value surged above $125,000 days leading up to the dip, eventually sliding to around $80,000. Many altcoins also sank overnight, erasing a significant portion of their value, and the total altcoin market cap (excluding BTC and ETH) plummeted by approximately 33% in just one day. Crypto sentiment has improved from late 2025’s “extreme fear,” but geopolitical risks and lack of retail activity may slow recovery. The market is still waiting to see how cryptocurrencies will be affected by the US strike on Venezuela. US President Trump announced on Saturday, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country.” Bitcoin did not exhibit the typical behavior of risk-on assets, which often decline during periods of acute and violent geopolitical or economic stress. While some analysts believe the attack is unlikely to impact the value of Bitcoin significantly, others warn that its true outcome may not become clear until U.S. markets open on Monday.

The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend injected fresh uncertainty into global markets, influencing moves across equities, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and currencies, while also prompting sharp political reactions from allies and further pointed remarks from President Donald Trump. Asian markets and oil react to Venezuela developments Asian equities advanced broadly on Monday, with investors weighing geopolitical risks against optimism ahead of a heavy slate of economic data. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.36%, while S&P 500 e-mini futures edged up 0.13%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 3%, nearing a record high reached two months ago, after data showed manufacturing activity stabilised in December following five months of contraction. South Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s benchmark index both climbed more than 2.7% to fresh record highs. Elsewhere, Australia’s benchmark index added 0.1%. China-linked markets lagged. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.01%, dragged lower by energy stocks after a gauge of Hong Kong-listed oil and gas companies fell 3.1%. Oil prices were choppy as markets assessed the impact of the US intervention in Venezuela and an OPEC+ decision to keep output unchanged. Brent crude futures fell 0.3% to $60.55 a barrel. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said the removal of Maduro was “unlikely to have meaningful near-term economic consequences for the global economy,” though he warned that “its political and geopolitical ramifications will reverberate.” Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research, said Venezuela would need significant capital and engineering support to restore output. “We are therefore not sellers of oil in this situation and, in fact, think that upside risks could develop,” he said. Bitcoin and safe havens gain on political uncertainty Bitcoin rose to a three-week high in early Asian trading as political uncertainty boosted demand for alternative and haven assets. The largest cryptocurrency climbed as much as 2.3% to $93,323, its highest level since Dec. 11, before easing back to around $91,453 later in the session. Ether was little changed at $3,141. The move came alongside gains in precious metals. Gold rose about 1.8% to $4,411.50 an ounce, after earlier jumping above $4,400, while silver surged as much as 3.92% as investors sought safety. Bitcoin’s recent gains follow weeks of range-bound trading and come despite the cryptocurrency ending last year down 6.5%. Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX, said the rally was being driven by crypto-native firms and a lack of selling by miners, family offices, and large funds. On Jan. 2, investors put $471 million into US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the largest daily inflow since Nov. 11. Denmark pushes back on Trump’s Greenland rhetoric Geopolitical tensions extended beyond Latin America. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned President Trump to stop threatening to acquire Greenland, just a day after the US operation in Venezuela. “The Kingdom of Denmark — and thus Greenland — is part of NATO and is therefore covered by the alliance’s security guarantee,” Frederiksen said, adding that she would “strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally.” Her remarks followed comments by Trump, quoted by The Atlantic, saying, “We do need Greenland, absolutely.” Trump has long floated the idea of acquiring the mineral-rich territory, an ambition that has been repeatedly rejected by both Greenland and Denmark. Trump targets Colombia and signals wider drug crackdown A day after Maduro’s capture, Trump signaled that other countries could face pressure over drug trafficking. Speaking aboard Air Force One, he singled out Colombia and its president, Gustavo Petro. “Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long,” Trump said. Trump said his campaign against Venezuela would also weaken Cuba, noting that Cuban soldiers assist Venezuela’s military. “Cuba looks like it is ready to fall,” he said, without offering evidence. He struck a slightly more conciliatory tone toward Mexico, while repeating complaints about drug flows and noting that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has rejected his offer of US military assistance.

CLSK trades at an 11.63x forward P/E (GAAP), a 63% discount to peers, highlighting significant undervaluation. The company's AI/HPC diversification is a long-term pivot, enhancing its strategic appeal beyond pure Bitcoin mining. With a $43,000 margin cost per Bitcoin, CLSK is well-positioned to weather potential crypto downturns. Since my previous coverage on CleanSpark ( CLSK ), the stock experienced a sharp downswing. Although weak AI sentiment clouds the AI/HPC pivot, in my opinion, the poor stock price action was mainly driven by Bitcoin volatility. Quite frankly, it does make sense, as 100% of its revenue comes from mining operations. Unless the company signs early contracts with pre-funding, it will take time for CleanSpark to expand its AI capabilities, so I don't expect revenue from the pivot any time soon. Now, has anything changed in the bigger picture? I don't think so. I am holding the stock, and I am not nervous despite a sharp correction. I believe that at the current price tag, it remains heavily discounted. CLSK trades at 11.63 forward P/E (GAAP) , a 63% discount versus peers at 31.23x. The diversification into AI/HPC is a long-term pivot that makes CleanSpark a more compelling play, and with a roughly $43,000 margin cost per Bitcoin , it seems to be well-positioned to withstand another crypto winter if needed. I reiterate a Strong Buy rating. Zero Convertible Enables AI and Mining Infrastructure Funding I love that management stands by its initial plan to not dilute shareholders through ATM offerings. Both mining and AI HPC operations are capital-intensive, and although debt-related funding remains through convertibles, that doesn't weigh on investors' shoulders in the meantime. CLSK closed approximately $1.15 billion convertible at 0% coupon to mature in 2032 as an alternative to raising cash through an ATM. What I also love about the recent announcement is that management stated that while funds will also be used for infrastructure opportunities, CleanSpark repurchased nearly 11% of the total outstanding common stock, reaching $460 million in returned value to shareholders. Quite honestly, that's the opposite of dilution, and to me it raises confidence in management's decisions. This may help EPS growth, too. CLSK: The Company Aim To Lead Energy And Infrastructure Compute (CleanSpark Investor Relations) The legacy miner's ambitions are costly. That's why I like the company's decision to use convertibles to scale, rather than dilute its current shareholders. Especially as there's a significant demand for funding at 0% coupon. It expects to revolutionize into an energy and infrastructure compute leader . I love this. The global AI data center market is anticipated to surge 26.8% CAGR over the next 6 years and reach $93.6 billion in market size by 2032. Now, that's already a significant market, about $18 billion, but it remains in its early stage. CleanSpark offers exposure to this high-growth market from its first innings while also maintaining focus on Bitcoin mining operations. Such peers as IREN ( IREN ) have decided to completely pivot to AI HPC . Now, while the market has rewarded IREN with a massive upside in the short term, logically, it has transferred dependency from Bitcoin volatility to the AI space that is also tied to multiple uncertainties. I am not a fan of this, and quite frankly, I am happy with CLSK's decision to diversify but not shift focus completely. What's next? CleanSpark chose Texas for its AI HPC expansion, acquiring a site and 285 MW power supply agreements . That's a significant step for scaling into the next-gen AI and cloud capabilities. Business transformation unlocks new opportunities for CLSK to tap into a high-growth market. To me, that's an appealing shift. What I also think the market discounts is the company's know-how on how to maintain high-performance computing and sustain the uptick. I believe it will leverage knowledge and experience from mining operations to AI HPC pivot, making it a compelling service provider. Moderately Leveraged Balance Sheet, but Fundamentals Remain Intact Yes, the AI HPC pioneer has a moderately leveraged capital structure that I don't love, but quite frankly, it doesn't make me too concerned. CLSK: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) CleanSpark has about $826 million in total obligations . It also has nearly $43 million in cash, but that barely offsets the leverage. Now, why doesn't it make me too concerned? If we have a look at the interest expenses over the past 12 months, CLSK paid $11.3 million to service its debt . That's insignificant. It accounts for about a 1.3% annual interest rate versus total obligations, and quite frankly, that's below the current inflation. On top of that, CLSK benefited from high-yield accounts and generated $4.1 million in interest and investment income, offsetting the interest expense over the past year. So, it actually experienced $7.1 million in net interest expense, or less than 1% versus total obligations. I'd also want to flag that while a dovish Fed could boost sentiment for risk assets, CLSK doesn't really need interest rates to drop significantly. The current debt is tied to low interest rates, which leaves financial flexibility for management. CLSK: FY2025 Performance (CleanSpark Investor Relations) I think we all could agree that FY2025 was a breakthrough performance year for CleanSpark, supported by favorable Bitcoin price action. Now, it has achieved $766 million in FY2025 revenue , which represents a 102% increase on a year-over-year basis. For the bottom line, it was a turnaround year too, posting nearly $365 million in net income, a substantial difference from $146 million in net loss last year. CleanSpark reached 50 EH/s for mining operations and managed to mine 7,873 coins over the FY2025. What I mostly love about the performance is it managed to maintain low-cost operations while significantly increasing EH/s. As I stated previously in the article, the marginal cost per Bitcoin was roughly $43,000. That's nearly 107% above the current BTCUSD price of roughly $89,000 . This supports my bullish stance, as Bitcoin could drop further, and CleanSpark would still mine profitably. Sure, we could argue that the outlook would deteriorate if BTCUSD dropped significantly. I'd like to emphasize a few things here. Firstly, if we assume Bitcoin dropped to the 200-week moving average of nearly $57,000 , which would technically mean a crypto winter, CLSK should be able to mine at approximately 33% profit versus the marginal cost. This indicates fundamental strength, low-cost power contracts, and significant execution, making it a compelling play. Secondly, sure, it would also take a hit on its Bitcoin holdings. It held 13,054 BTC at the end of November, but even if the BTC were to drop to $57,000, that's roughly $744 million in liquid assets at that price tag. CLSK would be able to cover its obligations to a large extent. Lastly, CLSK produced 587 coins in November alone, and while it reflected a 4% drop in BTC produced, the HODL holdings increased by 21 coins. In my opinion, that's due to network difficulty, because hashrate actually increased from 46.6 EH/s to 47.4 EH/s, indicating great execution, but natural fluctuation due to business origin. Quite frankly, in addition to the last argument, the fact that it has increased Bitcoin holdings while production was down on a month-over-month basis implies that management has the financial capabilities to achieve expansion goals without an urgent need for additional funding. That's why I think that fundamentals remain intact and the bigger picture is bullish. Undervalued Versus Peers CleanSpark trades at a compelling valuation. Versus the fiscal FY2026 estimate at 13x , while the 24-month earnings multiple reaches about 10x. CLSK: Trading At Compelling Valuation (Seeking Alpha) For instance, IREN trades at roughly 40x earnings multiple versus fiscal FY2026, while Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) trades at 48x . That's at least 3x undervaluation versus peers that have pivoted to AI HPC. We could also compare it to a more traditional Bitcoin miner, MARA Holdings ( MARA ). Now, in terms of the earnings multiple, MARA trades at 232x , which creates a massive gap versus CLSK's valuation. If we compare all these companies in terms of their book value, we can see that both CleanSpark and MARA trade at suppressed valuations. Surely enough, IREN and CIFR have AI HPC contracted revenue supporting their pivot to a high-growth market, resulting in a higher multiple. But if tailwinds materialize tied to global market growth, CLSK should be able to benefit from the bullish trend and rebound from the current level. CLSK: Price/Book Value Versus Peers (YCharts) Why does this matter? It tells me that the market hasn't really priced in its AI HPC pivot. Quite honestly, I like it a lot, especially as CLSK is pursuing strategic investments like the one in greater Houston tied to AI and cloud capabilities. In my opinion, the market is likely to reprice CLSK at a higher premium sooner rather than later. To this, on a forward Price/Book value ratio of 3.54 , CLSK trades at more than a 21% discount versus the sector median of 4.51, which argues for my bullish thesis. CleanSpark is also a profitable company, and I love that it operates at above-market margins. The gross profit margin (TTM) of 55% highlights a 13% outperformance versus peers at 49%. The net income margin (TTM) of 48% signals a nearly 10x advantage versus peers at 5%. Surely enough, we need to account for Bitcoin volatility, and unless BTCUSD rebounds from here, CLSK is likely to experience a contraction on the bottom line. However, the stock is down 22% over the past month , and it tells me that it could already be priced in. Risks and Concerns The crypto community is concerned that the digital assets could enter a prolonged bear market. Could that happen? Sure. Investors anticipated an end-year rally, but that didn't happen, and now one can only guess what is likely to happen next. As I have flagged, there's a possibility of BTCUSD approaching its 200-week moving average at nearly $57,000. Although this would imply a 56% drop from the current levels, based on my analysis, CLSK should still mine profitably. But we all could agree that such a poor sentiment would dramatically weigh on CLSK's stock price. To the last point, this also shows why I think this AI HPC pivot was a great strategic decision. Nevertheless, it comes with an execution risk. If CLSK struggles to gain market position in the AI HPC space and doesn't sign multi-year agreements with hyperscalers, sentiment may be clouded. Also, if there are concerns tied to scaling the business and infrastructure, investors may favor alternatives in the market. This AI HPC pivot also depends on AI sentiment. If heavy Capex investments don't translate to meaningful top- and bottom-line growth, hyperscalers may cut spending, which could cloud a bullish narrative, and likely struggle to keep up with estimated growth projections for this high-growth market. CleanSpark is a Strong Buy CLSK is a high-volatility stock, and price action could be brutal. 52-week trading range shows a 4x difference in price, and trust me, it could be a difficult stock to stomach for long-term holders who favor a stable investment environment. But I think the upside and risk ratio here is compelling. Based on my analysis, it remains undervalued versus peers, and because of the low cost to mine BTC, it appears well-positioned to withstand a crypto winter if one occurs. There's a big gap between earnings multiple versus AI HPC peers, and in terms of Price/Book value, the market seems to be discounting the stock. If CleanSpark continues to execute well, I think it may rebound from these levels, and the market could reprice sooner rather than later. I sustain my Strong Buy rating. 23 Wall Street analysts forecast a $23.27 12-month price target, indicating a 101% upside. Time will tell, but I agree with analysts.",CLSK|BTC-USD|MARA,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

María Corina Machado, a prominent advocate of Bitcoin, is a key figure in this shift. The Venezuelan opposition leader and winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize is a second-favorite to lead Venezuela away from Maduro’s authoritarian rule . Maduro has been moved to New York to face federal charges for narcotics trafficking and corruption. According to predictions by Kalshi, a market platform, Machado is expected to garner 28% of Venezuela’s vote by the end of 2026. She’s somewhat behind Edmundo González Urrutia of the Unitary Platform, who has a 32 percent chance. González Urrutia is widely believed to have won the country’s May 2025 election but was barred from taking office by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, led by Maduro. Third is Vice President Delcy Eloína Rodríguez, a former running mate of Maduro, who has a 27% chance. After Maduro was captured, the Supreme Court named Rodríguez acting president. US President Donald Trump said the US would oversee Venezuela until a new power is in place, raising a question mark over the country’s near-term future. If María Corina Machado leads, Venezuela could eventually enjoy fundamental human rights and political freedoms. The nation could also step up free-market reform by using Bitcoin (BTC $93,210) as an alternative to the Venezuelan bolívar, which has lost over 99.99% of its value since Maduro took office in 2013. Machado drives crypto adoption in Venezuela *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""7e7d0235-43c1-48dc-8e5e-0b9fd5af8f5f"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> María Corina Machado is well-acquainted with Bitcoin, having long seen it as more than just a currency — but as a means of survival, self-determination, and empowerment. In a 2024 conversation with Human Rights Foundation strategist Alex Gladstein, she outlined proposals to adopt Bitcoin as a national reserve asset and promote its use in everyday transactions. During Venezuela’s hyperinflation, the widespread adoption of Bitcoin was largely driven by its use by many people to protect their savings and make ends meet, enabling them to support their families. What started as a humanitarian solution has evolved into a crucial instrument of economic resilience — one that a future democratic Venezuela would seamlessly integrate into its financial system. With more than 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country since 2013, cryptocurrency has become vital for remitting money back home, as well as managing one’s own finances effectively. The Machado-led revolutionary government could institutionalize this stage of adopting new technology by creating an environment in which cryptocurrencies are used as currency in some markets (financial assets), supported for both local and international uses. Her rise marks a historic moment for the global crypto community: the potential for a great nation to adopt digital assets at a state level, legitimize them, and encourage others to do the same. Machado’s presidency could turn Venezuela into a model for crypto-powered economic resiliency and innovation. Trump questions Machado’s ability to lead Venezuela US President Donald Trump, however, doubts whether María Corina Machado can steer Venezuela out of Maduro’s rule. While Machado briefly surpassed Edmundo González Urrutia in Kalshi forecasts, Trump stated that she did not have the support or respect necessary to govern effectively. Yet analysts contend she already enjoys robust support from Venezuelans within the country as well as outside. Key to Trump’s challenge is Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, who is now also the leader of Venezuela’s United Socialist Party; the party run by President Maduro. Rodriguez initially said she would try to work with the U.S., then changed tack, describing Maduro’s arrest as all wrong and warning that there would be terrible consequences for a wrong move.

This substantial deposit wave, however, faces a critical imbalance as corresponding buying power, measured through stablecoin inflows, remains conspicuously weak, creating a complex puzzle for traders and long-term investors alike. The situation underscores a pivotal moment where on-chain data provides crucial signals about whale behavior and broader market sentiment. Decoding the $2.4B Binance BTC and ETH Inflow Data from the analytics platform CryptoQuant, highlighted in a report by Cointelegraph, reveals the precise composition of this massive movement. Analyst CryptoOnchain detailed that the inflows consisted of approximately $1.33 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and $1.07 billion in Ethereum (ETH) . To provide context, this volume represents one of the largest concentrated deposits into a single exchange in recent months. Typically, such significant transfers from private wallets to an exchange custodial address suggest holders are preparing to sell, as exchanges facilitate the easiest liquidity conversion. Consequently, this action often precedes or coincides with downward price pressure, especially if demand does not match the potential supply. For comparison, here is a breakdown of the weekly inflows: Asset Approximate Value Implied Market Signal Bitcoin (BTC) $1.33 Billion High Potential Selling Pressure Ethereum (ETH) $1.07 Billion High Potential Selling Pressure Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, etc.) $42 Million Low New Buying Power The stark contrast between the $2.4 billion in potential sell-side assets and the mere $42 million in new stablecoin buying power forms the core of the current market concern. Stablecoins act as the primary fuel for cryptocurrency purchases; their inflow directly represents fresh capital ready to buy BTC, ETH, and other digital assets. This multi-billion-dollar divergence suggests the market may struggle to absorb the deposited coins without a price correction, unless other sources of demand emerge unexpectedly. The Critical Lag in Cryptocurrency Buying Power The meager $42 million in stablecoin deposits presents a particularly telling data point. Historically, robust bull markets are characterized by heavy stablecoin inflows into exchanges, as traders position themselves to purchase assets. The current lack thereof indicates several potential scenarios: Capital Rotation: Existing capital within the crypto ecosystem is being reshuffled, not expanded. Market Caution: Traders are waiting on the sidelines for clearer price direction or macroeconomic cues. External Drain: Capital may be flowing out of the crypto space into traditional assets or being held in off-exchange yield products. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain’s analysis points to another worrying trend: a decrease in the volume of Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges. This metric is often viewed as a proxy for long-term holding conviction, particularly among large investors or “whales.” When whales withdraw coins to cold storage, it signals a belief in future price appreciation and reduces immediate sell-side liquidity. A decline in this activity, therefore, suggests a potential weakening of long-term bullish sentiment among some of the market’s most influential participants. Expert Analysis on Whale Behavior and Price Impact The combination of rising exchange deposits and faltering whale accumulation creates a challenging environment for prices. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and IntoTheBlock have consistently noted that sustained price rallies require a foundation of strong holder conviction and continuous demand. The current on-chain data, as reported, presents a headwind to such a scenario. For instance, if the $2.4 billion in deposited assets were sold onto the market with only $42 million of dedicated new buy-side capital, order books would be overwhelmed, likely triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders and further declines. This dynamic does not occur in a vacuum. It interacts with broader financial conditions, including interest rate expectations, traditional equity market performance, and geopolitical stability. Market participants must consider whether this is an isolated liquidity event or part of a larger trend of profit-taking following recent price gains. The timing is also crucial, as it provides a real-time case study in how on-chain analytics have become an indispensable tool for gauging market structure beyond mere price charts. Historical Context and Market Structure Implications Similar patterns of large exchange inflows preceding price corrections have been observed in previous market cycles. For example, periods in early 2022 and mid-2023 saw analogous spikes in exchange balances that correlated with subsequent price drops. The current event’s scale, however, makes it particularly notable for the 2025 market landscape. The data underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency markets, where millions of individual data points are aggregated to reveal the strategic movements of large holders. The structure of modern crypto markets also plays a role. With the proliferation of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, investors now have alternatives to centralized exchanges for lending, borrowing, and earning yield. While the data cited focuses on Binance, a cross-exchange analysis would provide a fuller picture. Nevertheless, Binance’s position as a global liquidity hub makes its flows a critical bellwether. The event highlights the importance of monitoring multiple data streams: Exchange Net Flow: (Deposits – Withdrawals) Stablecoin Supply Ratio: Measuring stablecoin market cap against BTC’s. Entity-Adjusted Dormancy: Gauging the spending behavior of long-held coins. Conclusion The $2.4 billion deposit of BTC and ETH into Binance serves as a powerful warning signal for the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing a growing divergence between potential supply and available demand. The critical lag in buying power, evidenced by minimal stablecoin inflows, combined with a noted decrease in long-term whale accumulation, creates a challenging technical backdrop for any immediate price rally. While on-chain data does not dictate future prices absolutely, it provides a transparent window into the balance of power between buyers and sellers. Market participants would be prudent to monitor whether this imbalance corrects through an influx of new capital or resolves through price discovery, marking another chapter in the volatile evolution of digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when large amounts of BTC are deposited to an exchange like Binance? Typically, it signals that the holders of those assets intend to sell them in the near future, as exchanges are the primary venues for converting crypto to fiat or stablecoins. It increases the immediate available supply on the market. Q2: Why is the $42 million stablecoin inflow considered low? Stablecoins represent ready-to-use buying power. In a healthy, ascending market, large crypto deposits are often met with similarly large stablecoin inflows from investors looking to buy. A ratio of $2.4B to $42M indicates a severe shortage of new capital poised to purchase the deposited assets. Q3: How does whale withdrawal behavior affect cryptocurrency prices? When large investors (whales) withdraw coins from exchanges to private custody, it reduces the immediate sell-side supply and signals long-term holding confidence. A decrease in this activity can suggest these key players are less committed to accumulating or are preparing to realize profits. Q4: Can prices still go up despite these bearish on-chain signals? Yes. On-chain data is one of several factors influencing price. Positive macroeconomic news, a major institutional adoption announcement, or a sudden surge in retail demand could override these technical signals. However, the data presents a significant headwind. Q5: Where does this data about Binance deposits come from? The data is sourced from blockchain analytics firms like CryptoQuant, which track the flow of assets to and from known exchange wallet addresses. These firms aggregate this public blockchain data to provide insights into market sentiment and liquidity conditions.

Key Takeaways: Crypto whales moved about $2.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ether onto Binance, marking the exchange’s largest net inflow in a month. Stablecoin flows remained flat, signaling weak buying power despite the surge in whale deposits. Slowing accumulation and reduced withdrawals suggest growing selling pressure and fading long-term holding. According to on-chain data cited by CryptoOnchain, so-called whales deposited roughly $2.4 billion to Binance, split almost evenly between Bitcoin and Ether. The inflows mark the exchange’s largest net deposit total in about a month, with $1.33 billion in Bitcoin and $1.07 billion in Ether added over the period. Whale Inflows Rise as Stablecoin Buying Power Stalls However, analysts noted a key imbalance. “Crucially, this surge in risk-asset deposits was not accompanied by new buying power,” CryptoOnchain said, pointing to stablecoin net flows that were largely flat at around $42 million for the week. Most of those movements reflected transfers between the Ethereum and Tron blockchains rather than fresh capital entering the market. Large transfers from private wallets to exchanges are typically interpreted as either positioning for spot selling or the use of assets as collateral in derivatives markets. In this case, the absence of strong stablecoin inflows suggests limited capacity for sustained buying pressure. Additional metrics point to a broader slowdown in accumulation. CryptoOnchain said Bitcoin accumulation has stalled since October, while the average size of deposits to Binance has risen sharply. Bitcoin Inflows to Binance are Increasingly Whale-Sized “A 34x increase in the average size of each deposit. This metric reflects the average BTC per inflow transaction, signaling that larger holders are now more active on Binance.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/SkpgMUG8vP — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 4, 2026 Average transaction sizes flowing onto the exchange jumped from roughly eight to 10 BTC earlier in the year to between 22 and 26 BTC recently, indicating that large holders are moving “substantial amounts” of Bitcoin onto the platform. At the same time, outflows from Binance have weakened. The average size of withdrawal transactions has dropped into what analysts described as a “suppressed range,” with exchange outflow means fluctuating between 5.5 and 8.3 BTC. That trend suggests fewer coins are being pulled into cold storage, a behavior often linked to long-term holding. “In other words, large-scale accumulation and the movement of Bitcoin into cold storage by major holders have drastically decreased,” CryptoOnchain said. The firm described the combination of rising inflows, muted outflows, and flat stablecoin demand as a warning sign that selling pressure could build. Bitcoin Seen Entering Accumulation Phase in Early 2026 Analyst Linh Tran believes Bitcoin entered a corrective phase in late 2025 after peaking near $126,000 and falling roughly 35% to around $80,000. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, she said this pullback reflects a structural shift in the market, with Bitcoin now driven less by retail speculation and more by macroeconomic conditions, institutional flows, and regulatory developments. Meanwhile, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt believes Bitcoin could benefit in 2026 as easing monetary policy injects fresh liquidity into global markets, reviving risk appetite after a prolonged period of tight financial conditions. Barhydt said the US central bank is already laying the groundwork for looser policy. He pointed to early signs of renewed balance sheet support, describing the current environment as “quantitative easing light,” with the Federal Reserve stepping in to support demand for government debt.

Well, this marks a decisive shift in the bank’s stance, from offering crypto exposure only upon client request to actively promoting it through financial advisors. For years, major banks sidelined cryptocurrencies over volatility and regulatory risks, with BofA restricting access to client-requested exposure only. Its shift to advisor-recommended allocations now marks a clear institutional endorsement, positioning digital assets as a legitimate portfolio allocation rather than a speculative outlier. Notably, the 4% allocation guidance strikes a balanced approach that while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain volatile, growing research shows that limited exposure can improve risk-adjusted returns. By keeping allocations modest, Bank of America enables clients to capture crypto’s upside while managing downside risk. Why does this matter? Well, this shift reflects strong, sustained client demand. Institutional and high-net-worth investors are no longer debating whether crypto belongs in portfolios, but how to allocate responsibly. Bitcoin, often called “digital gold,” is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation, currency debasement, and long-term macroeconomic uncertainty, themes that strongly resonate in today’s volatile global financial landscape. Beyond client demand, growing regulatory clarity has been a decisive factor in Bank of America’s shift. The rollout of regulated crypto products, most notably spot Bitcoin ETFs, alongside stronger institutional custody solutions has significantly reduced the operational and compliance risks that once sidelined traditional banks. These advances now allow advisors to recommend crypto exposure confidently within established regulatory frameworks. Bank of America’s endorsement could carry wide-reaching consequences across the financial industry. As a bellwether institution, its strategic moves often set the tone for peers. This pivot may accelerate a broader transition among major banks and wealth managers, from offering crypto only on request to actively integrating digital assets into mainstream portfolio strategies. Ultimately, Bank of America’s shift from client-requested only to advisor-recommended marks more than a policy change, it signals a fundamental rethinking of crypto within traditional finance. As Bitcoin and digital assets mature, their inclusion in mainstream portfolios is no longer a passing trend but a defining evolution in modern investing. Conclusion Bank of America’s move to recommend up to a 4% allocation to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies marks a pivotal shift in traditional finance. What was once a speculative, client-initiated exposure has evolved into an advisor-endorsed strategy, signaling crypto’s rising legitimacy as a portfolio diversifier. Driven by strong client demand, clearer regulation, and Bitcoin’s perceived role as a macro hedge, the decision sends a clear message: digital assets are no longer fringe investments, but an emerging fixture in mainstream portfolio construction.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Inflows and activity point to the engagement of large-scale traders, rather than retail investors. Whale activity and influence on exchanges have increased to a 10-month peak. Overall, the whale activity trend has emerged in place of retail interest. The expansion of whale influence peaked close to a 10-month high, just as the crypto market started a tentative recovery in the new year. For all exchanges, the BTC exchange whale ratio climbed to 0.504, a level not seen since March 2025. The ratio means whales are potentially putting selling pressure on BTC, and increasing the supply of available reserves. The whale metric takes into account the top 10 inflows relative to total exchange deposits. In January, the metric had a sharp increase, signaling the entrance of large market players. Historically, moves such as those have emerged as a source of selling pressure. The inflows coincided with a recovery for BTC above $92,000. The coin movement is happening on all exchanges and is not an isolated event. Binance consolidated whale traffic Binance remained the center of crypto inflows, now holding over 71% of stablecoin deposits. The exchange also draws in BTC deposits, with native BTC remaining one of the most active assets. Inflows to Binance are becoming larger on average, signaling a shift to large-scale players in the past two years. | Source: CryptoQuant . The exchange is also showing a trend of growing mean inflows, signaling the general prevalence of larger players. Binance is now the target of large-scale whale deposits. The inflows accelerated after the launch of multiple ETFs, signaling the exchange may be one of the trading venues for the funds. Whale activity may also signal an attempt to use the exchange’s liquidity and take profits during the short-term rallies. While Binance has been a retail venue, now the main centralized exchange has transformed into a hub for large players. Retail has moved to other platforms in Binance’s ecosystem, especially in-wallet activity and decentralized trading. Does whale activity signal BTC risk? Increased BTC whale activity may be a cautionary flag, especially as BTC returned to bullish momentum. Whales have taken profits near local market tops, and may be preparing to sell if BTC breaks out higher. The presence of whales may create price resistance for the leading coin. Other metrics may indicate better readiness for a rally, as BTC is also showing signs of reaching a local low. The current exchange whale ratio increase recalls previous selling periods, including the summer of 2025. Whales also moved in right after the October liquidation event, aiming to take profits before BTC had a more significant slide. Conditions may quickly shift on the BTC market, as there are also signs that whales are buying more coins through Binance. BTC is still showing signs of being in a bear market after a 30% cycle drawdown, but accumulation continues into new wallets, treasuries, and ETF inflows. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Analysts are now looking for further potential gains and the possibility of a return to six-figure Bitcoin prices. Michael Nadeau from The DeFi Report drew comparisons between the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, when BTC climbed 22% in the weeks that followed. “In the current environment, I’ve been anticipating a move for BTC back up to the 50-week moving average around $101,700,” he said . “Now we have a catalyst. The key question is whether that level can hold if it is, in fact, revisited.” A Bear Market Bounce What the analyst didn’t mention was the fact that 2022 was a bear market year that saw BTC decline 77% from its all-time high. A similar bear market scenario in 2026 could see the asset slump to $30,000. Trader Aaron Dishner echoed the sentiment, stating that crypto markets would bounce in early January as many traders likely closed positions before the end of 2025 for tax purposes, and would buy back aggressively at the start of 2026. “But my target for BTC is still $100k before the next leg down, and I imagine a LOT of you are wondering WHY!? Well, this happens at the start of every past bear market – in 2022, 2018, and 2015. This time is no different to me.” Bitcoin entrepreneur Joe Consorti was also convinced of a return to six figures first. BTC broke back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since October, testing levels not seen since early December, he said. “Sell pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Need to reclaim and hold the 50-week MA at $101k.” BTC is waking up in the new year, already up 6.24%. Broke back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since October. Testing levels not seen since early December. Sell pressure may be nearing exhaustion.

The asset is now moving towards the upper band of a six-week sideways channel and needs to clear resistance above $94,000 to break out of it. “There is strength beneath this overall bottoming move higher,” said analyst ‘Sykodelic’ who added, “We had the double buy signal on the relative strength two days ago.” The post Could More Geopolitical Tension Drive BTC Back to Six Figures? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,0,0,EN,"{

Following the euphoric memecoin mania that peaked and ultimately collapsed in November 2024, selling pressure steadily took control. Liquidity dried up, momentum faded, and most memecoins entered prolonged drawdowns that significantly underperformed the broader market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K As risk appetite weakened, memecoin dominance within the altcoin market continued to erode throughout the year. By December 2025, this dominance fell to a historical low, reflecting widespread capitulation among retail participants and a clear shift away from high-beta speculative assets. Many traders exited positions entirely, reinforcing the narrative that the memecoin cycle had fully played out. However, extreme pessimism often marks important turning points. According to an analysis by Darkfost from CryptoQuant, the current compression in memecoin dominance closely mirrors prior structural lows observed in past cycles. Notably, the last time memecoin dominance reached comparable levels, it occurred shortly before a powerful resurgence in the sector, driven by renewed liquidity, fresh narratives, and aggressive speculative flows. Memecoin Dominance Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Recent on-chain analysis highlights how far the memecoin sector has fallen relative to the broader altcoin market—and why some investors are starting to pay attention again. According to Darkfost’s framework, the key ratio compares the combined market capitalization of major memecoins against that of leading altcoins. At the height of the speculative frenzy in November 2024, this ratio climbed to roughly 0.11, meaning memecoins represented about 11% of total altcoin market value. That level reflected peak enthusiasm, heavy retail participation, and aggressive risk-taking. By December 2025, however, the same ratio had collapsed to around 0.032. In practical terms, memecoins had lost nearly two-thirds of their relative weight within the altcoin universe. This sharp contraction aligns with prolonged underperformance, capital rotation into larger assets, and widespread capitulation after months of declining prices. Importantly, recent price action suggests the bleeding may be slowing. Over the past several days, some of the largest memecoins have posted notable rebounds, hinting at renewed speculative interest. While this move is far too early to confirm a full trend reversal, it does suggest that selling pressure is no longer one-sided. For now, the data points to a tentative stabilization phase rather than a confirmed memecoin season. Still, for high-risk investors, such deeply compressed relative valuations have historically preceded sharp, sentiment-driven rallies—provided risk is managed carefully and expectations remain realistic. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Setup Advances: CEX Volume Hits Cycle Highs Despite Price Weakness Technical Rebound After A Prolonged Downtrend The memecoin market cap chart shows a clear shift in structure after months of sustained weakness. Throughout the second half of 2025, total memecoin capitalization trended decisively lower, forming a sequence of lower highs and lower lows while remaining capped below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. However, recent price action suggests the first meaningful attempt at stabilization. The market cap has rebounded sharply from the December lows near the $35–38 billion zone and is now trading back above the short-term moving average, reclaiming the $46 billion area. This move is accompanied by a noticeable pickup in volume, indicating renewed participation rather than a purely technical bounce on thin liquidity. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Despite this improvement, the broader trend remains cautious. The memecoin market cap is still trading below the longer-term moving averages, which continue to slope downward and act as overhead resistance around the $50–55 billion range. This suggests that while downside momentum has slowed, the market has not yet transitioned into a confirmed uptrend. In practical terms, the chart points to a relief rally within a broader bearish structure. For memecoins to regain sustained momentum, the market would need to consolidate above current levels and reclaim higher moving averages. Signaling that speculative capital is returning with conviction rather than opportunism.

This significant capital movement halts a two-week period of net outflows, signaling renewed institutional confidence as the 2025 cryptocurrency investment landscape undergoes a notable shift. The data reveals a compelling story of changing investor preferences, with Ethereum products experiencing explosive growth while Bitcoin maintains its foundational role. Digital Asset Funds Rebound with $582 Million Inflow CoinShares, a leading digital asset investment firm, published its weekly analysis on Monday. The report provides a critical snapshot of institutional sentiment. The $582 million net inflow for the week ending March 9, 2025, marks a decisive pivot. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing the underlying catalysts for this resurgence. The inflow primarily targeted exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed in major financial hubs. These products offer traditional investors regulated exposure to cryptocurrency prices without direct ownership. This weekly rebound occurs within a broader annual context of robust activity. For the full year of 2025 to date, these investment vehicles have attracted a total of $47.2 billion in net inflows. This figure remains remarkably close to the $48.7 billion recorded for the entirety of 2024. The sustained volume demonstrates the maturing integration of digital assets into global portfolios. However, a dramatic redistribution of capital beneath this stable top-line number tells a more nuanced story. The 2025 Allocation Shift: Ethereum’s Meteoric Rise The most striking development within the 2025 data is the dramatic reallocation between major assets. Inflows into Bitcoin-specific products, while still substantial, have fallen by 35% year-over-year to $26.9 billion. Conversely, Ethereum products witnessed a staggering 138% surge in inflows, reaching $12.7 billion. This divergence highlights a maturing market where investors are diversifying beyond the flagship asset. The surge in Ethereum interest likely correlates with several key developments: Network Upgrades: Successful implementations of scalability and efficiency improvements on the Ethereum network. DeFi and NFT Maturation: The sustained growth of decentralized finance and non-fungible token ecosystems built primarily on Ethereum. Staking Yield Appeal: The ability for certain ETP structures to offer exposure to staking rewards, providing a yield component absent from pure Bitcoin products. Other altcoins also posted impressive figures. XRP and Solana investment products attracted $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion in net inflows, respectively. This strong performance indicates investor appetite for selective altcoin exposure. However, the category of “other altcoins” collectively saw a 30% decrease in inflows compared to the previous year. This suggests a consolidation effect, where capital is concentrating into a handful of leading projects with clearer use cases and liquidity. Analyzing the Broader Crypto Investment Landscape The weekly inflow data cannot be viewed in isolation. It interacts with macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and on-chain activity. For instance, the reversal of outflows often coincides with periods of price stability or bullish technical indicators for major cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, announcements regarding regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions like the United States or the European Union frequently precipitate institutional capital movements. The CoinShares report serves as a reliable lagging indicator of decisions made by fund managers and accredited investors. The consistency of near-$50 billion annual inflows across 2024 and 2025 is itself a powerful signal. It underscores that digital asset exposure is transitioning from a speculative bet to a strategic allocation for a growing segment of the investment community. This trend persists despite periodic volatility, suggesting a long-term horizon for many participants. The structure of these flows—overwhelmingly into regulated, exchange-listed products—emphasizes the demand for secure and familiar investment wrappers. 2024 vs. 2025 Digital Asset Fund Inflow Comparison (Year-to-Date) Asset 2024 Inflows 2025 Inflows Year-over-Year Change Bitcoin $41.4B (est.) $26.9B -35% Ethereum $5.3B (est.) $12.7B +138% XRP N/A $3.7B N/A Solana N/A $3.6B N/A Total Market $48.7B $47.2B -3% Expert Perspective on Institutional Behavior Market analysts interpret these flows as evidence of portfolio diversification within the digital asset class. “The 2025 data clearly shows investors are no longer treating ‘crypto’ as a monolith,” explains a veteran financial analyst specializing in emerging assets. “They are making distinct allocations based on technology, use case, and risk profile. The massive growth in Ethereum inflows reflects a bet on its ecosystem utility, while the sustained Bitcoin inflows represent a continued store-of-value thesis.” This behavioral shift mirrors earlier patterns in traditional markets, where investors first adopt a broad asset class before strategically weighting its components. The impact of these fund flows extends beyond the products themselves. Sustained inflows provide underlying buy-side pressure in spot markets, as issuers must purchase the corresponding assets to back their ETP shares. This mechanism creates a direct conduit from traditional finance into the crypto economy. Therefore, weekly reports like those from CoinShares are closely monitored for early signs of changing supply and demand dynamics that could influence broader market prices. Conclusion The $582 million weekly net inflow into digital asset funds represents a significant resurgence of institutional interest, breaking a short streak of outflows. More importantly, the full-year 2025 data paints a picture of a maturing market where total capital remains steady but its distribution is evolving rapidly. Ethereum has emerged as a formidable destination for investment, seeing a 138% surge in inflows, while Bitcoin continues to anchor the market with substantial, if slightly diminished, flows. The strong performances of XRP and Solana, contrasted with a decline for other altcoins, indicate a flight to quality and liquidity. Ultimately, these digital asset fund flow trends confirm the asset class’s ongoing integration into the global financial system, marked by strategic diversification and a focus on fundamental value drivers. FAQs Q1: What does a “net inflow” mean for digital asset funds? A1: A net inflow means more new capital was invested into these funds and products than was withdrawn during the measured period. It indicates positive investor sentiment and buying pressure for the underlying assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q2: Why did Ethereum fund inflows surge by 138% in 2025? A2: The surge is attributed to growing investor confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), successful network upgrades improving scalability, and the yield potential from staking mechanisms offered by some investment products. Q3: Are digital asset fund inflows the same as direct cryptocurrency purchases? A3: Not exactly. These inflows represent investments into regulated financial products (like ETFs or ETPs) that track the price of cryptocurrencies. The fund issuer then typically buys the underlying asset, so it indirectly creates buying pressure in the spot market. Q4: What is the significance of the $47.2 billion total inflow for 2025? A4: The figure, which is similar to 2024’s total, demonstrates sustained institutional demand. It suggests that allocating to digital assets is becoming a consistent strategy for many investors, not just a reaction to short-term price spikes. Q5: How reliable is CoinShares as a source for this data? A5: CoinShares is a established and publicly-listed digital asset investment and trading firm. Their weekly fund flows report is widely cited by major financial news outlets and is considered a authoritative source for tracking institutional movement in the crypto ETP/ETF space.

The research, titled “ Common Bitcoin Energy Misconceptions ,” dismantles several widely circulated claims about Bitcoin mining’s resource consumption and environmental footprint. Batten presents evidence from peer-reviewed studies and real-world grid data that contradicts narratives suggesting the technology burdens power systems and drives up consumer costs. https://t.co/HQ93NP9I92 — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) January 3, 2026 Grid Stabilization Through Flexible Demand Multiple independent studies confirm Bitcoin mining’s capacity to balance electrical grids due to its interruptible nature, particularly on networks transitioning toward higher concentrations of variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind. A whitepaper referenced by Batten from Duke University energy experts concluded that Controllable Load Resources, including Bitcoin mining operations , help stabilize grids and defer the costs of expensive infrastructure upgrades. He also referenced research from ERCOT, the Texas grid that hosts the largest concentration of Bitcoin mining globally, which shows predominantly stabilizing effects from near-daily Frequency Regulation and Demand Response services. Former ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones summarized the findings: “ [Bitcoin mining operations] have found a way to come into the market and take some of that excess wind in offpeak periods. Then it can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers… And if a generator trips offline, it can very quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid more efficiently. “ According to him, Texas documented one mild localized destabilization incident involving Bitcoin mining on April 25, 2024, while multiple large-scale stabilization events occurred over the same multi-year period, including emergency grid support during the July 2022 heatwave. Consumer Cost Reduction Through Multiple Mechanisms Contrary to claims that Bitcoin miners increase residential electricity expenses, data presented by Batten from Texas between 2021 and 2024 shows that total electricity costs paid by residential customers rose 23.8%, or 7.0% when inflation-adjusted, compared to the national average increase of 24.67%. The analysis identifies five mechanisms through which Bitcoin mining reduces consumer costs: Monetizing renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted Creating competitive markets for Ancillary Services Eliminating the need for additional gas peaker plants Reducing curtailment fees Deferring grid infrastructure expenses. Jones noted “ the capability for [Bitcoin Mining] to meet our ancillary services at the lowest possible cost means lower costs for all consumers in the State of Texas. ” After the 2021 Texas blackouts, ERCOT initially proposed building gas peaker plants at an estimated cost of $18 billion, but instead integrated Bitcoin miners as a flexible load capable of rapidly reducing consumption during grid stress. Two documented international cases demonstrate direct price impacts. Norwegian residents in September 2024 experienced a 20% increase in electricity prices after Bitcoin mining operations departed. Source: CNBC (Screenshot) Additionally, CNBC reported that adding Bitcoin mining to a rural microgrid in Kenya “ dropped the price of power from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to 25 cents per kWh ” by monetizing previously wasted hydroelectric energy. Transaction Metrics and Environmental Performance Batten’s document also addresses the per-transaction energy claim, stating the metric “ is dismissed in four peer-reviewed studies (Masanet et al., 2019; Dittmar et al., 2019; Sedlmeir et al., 2020; and Sai and Vraken, 2023) as well as by Cambridge University because Bitcoin’s resource use does not come from its transactions. “ Cambridge data from 2025 showed that previous estimates overestimated Bitcoin’s electronic waste by 1204%, indicating an actual annual eWaste of 2.3 kilotons rather than the claimed 30 kilotons. Bitcoin mining has crossed the 50% sustainable energy threshold according to robust third-party data, exceeding the global average grid mix of approximately 40% renewable energy. Cambridge estimates current Bitcoin mining emissions at 39.8 MtCO2e attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from scope-2 electricity usage, with 5.5% of annual carbon debt offset through methane mitigation from oil and gas operations. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is once again edging closer to uncharted territory as the network prepares for its first adjustment of 2026. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/Ez9uxnC3rE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 29, 2025 Notably, according to a recent Cryptonews report, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rose to 148.2 trillion in the final adjustment of 2025, with projections pointing toward 149 trillion by January 8, 2026, as average block times hover near 9.95 minutes.

However, $BTC has now come up against a major horizontal resistance level at $93,000. Do the bulls still have enough in the tank to break through, or is this a perfect place for a rejection? $BTC overbought: can bulls still break out? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC shows how the price has finally begun to angle upward after passing through the downtrend line, while using the major ascending trendline as a base. Nevertheless, a major horizontal resistance level was waiting at around $93,500, where it appears the price has met with rejection. There is still a chance that the bulls could make another huge effort and break up and beyond this horizontal line, but given that $BTC is overbought on all the short time frames up to the daily, it would make sense for the next reversal phase to kick in now. A possible factor for a continuation of the rally is how far down the price will drop. If the price comes back to the major ascending trendline and dips below it again, things will be pretty much back to where they were in these last several weeks of sideways up and down chop. However, if the price only makes a shallow dip, perhaps coming back to retest $90,000, and confirming it as support, the rally may be able to continue, with the key level of $93,500 being the one to break and hold above. $93,500 is a hugely important level Source: TradingView The daily chart gives a better view of the breakout so far, and also gives more perspective on the horizontal resistance at $93,500. If one looks left along this line, it can be seen that this is in fact an important price structure shelf. Going further left beyond the confines of this chart also supports this. For the $BTC price to break through this level would be huge. The next big structural level after this is at $101,000, and the price would be likely to get there fairly quickly once $93,500 can be broken and held above. Notwithstanding, there are some bearish indications in the chart that need to be dealt with. Firstly, the Stochastic RSI indicators on all the short term time frames are at or near their top limits. These will need to reset, at least somewhat, before the price can truly start to motor higher. Secondly, the $BTC price is still in a bear flag. The upper limits of this flag could correspond with a potential price of around $100,000, which would match the horizontal resistance, making this a difficult barrier for the bulls to break. Lastly, the 200-day simple moving average is angled downward, which has only happened once in this entire bull cycle, and never at this much of an incline. It must be said that the price has now regained the 50-day SMA, which is perhaps starting to curl back round to the upside. A textbook breakout Source: TradingView When looking at the $BTC price in the weekly time frame it is perhaps best not to overcomplicate matters. What can be seen is a textbook breakout of a falling wedge - a pattern that would normally result in a break to the upside rather than the downside. While the price is admittedly in a bear flag, if there is going to be a strong rally back to the highs, there is only one direction to go, and that’s up and through the top of said bear flag. Much overthinking of what might possibly happen is going to be going on in the heads of most traders and investors. That said, investing is about looking at the balance of probabilities, and then going with what seems most likely. Good risk management will help if the market starts to reverse again. Finally, arguably one of the most reliable indicators is the Stochastic RSI - especially in the higher time frames. It’s rather like the tide going in and out. Looking left at the last time the Stochastic RSI indicators moved up from the bottom in this weekly time frame, it can be observed that a strong rally ensued.

According to exclusive data from the leading derivatives exchange Deribit, the total open interest for these specific call options has ballooned to a staggering $1.45 billion. This remarkable trend, first reported by CoinDesk, signals a profound shift in institutional and sophisticated retail sentiment, moving beyond mere speculation into a structured financial gamble on Bitcoin’s near-term destiny. The sheer scale of these positions introduces complex new dynamics into the crypto market’s underlying mechanics. Bitcoin Options Market Reaches Unprecedented Scale The derivatives landscape for Bitcoin has matured dramatically since its inception. Currently, the focal point is the January expiry cycle for call options with a $100,000 strike price. Data reveals that $828 million of the total $1.45 billion in open interest is set to mature this very month, creating a significant event horizon for price action. Furthermore, traders added 420 BTC worth of exposure to these contracts in just the last 24 hours, demonstrating accelerating interest. This activity is not isolated; it reflects a broader institutionalization of crypto finance, where options provide both hedging tools and high-leverage speculation. For context, the total open interest for all Bitcoin options across major exchanges now routinely exceeds $20 billion, establishing derivatives as a primary price discovery venue. The Mechanics of a $100,000 Bet Understanding this surge requires a grasp of options basics. A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase Bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike) by a specific date. Traders buying these $100,000 calls are betting Bitcoin’s price will exceed that level by January expiry. They pay a premium for this right. If BTC trades below $100,000 at expiry, the options expire worthless, and the premium is lost. However, the potential profit is theoretically unlimited above the strike price. This structure allows for massive leverage; a small move in BTC’s price can lead to exponential gains or losses on the option’s value. Gamma Exposure and the Dealer Squeeze Catalyst Beyond simple bullish bets, advanced analysis from firms like QCP Capital reveals a more intricate market force at play: the gamma squeeze. When traders buy large volumes of call options, the institutions selling those options (known as dealers or market makers) must hedge their risk. They typically do this by dynamically buying or selling the underlying asset—Bitcoin. The current market state places these dealers in a “short gamma” position. Essentially, as Bitcoin’s price rises, dealers are forced to buy more BTC to stay hedged, which itself pushes the price higher, forcing more buying. QCP Capital notes that this reflexive buying pressure could intensify dramatically if Bitcoin surpasses the $94,000 threshold. Concurrently, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures on Deribit has exceeded 30% annualized. This high rate indicates extreme leverage and bullish sentiment in the futures market, often preceding volatile moves. The convergence of high futures funding and massive call option interest creates a potentially explosive feedback loop. Dealers hedging their short options exposure buy spot BTC, driving the price up, which triggers more call option buying and further dealer hedging. Short Gamma: A dealer’s position where their hedging requires them to buy an asset as its price rises and sell as it falls, amplifying market moves. Open Interest: The total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. Strike Price: The predetermined price at which an option can be exercised. Historical Precedents and Market Cycles This phenomenon is not entirely new. Similar patterns of escalating call option interest preceded major Bitcoin rallies in late 2020 and early 2021. During those cycles, concentrated buying of call options at strikes like $50,000 and $60,000 created dealer hedging flows that contributed to the parabolic move to an all-time high. Market analysts now watch the “options skew,” which measures the implied volatility of calls versus puts. A skew favoring calls, as seen currently, indicates traders are willing to pay more for bullish protection and speculation. The current scale, however, is unprecedented in dollar terms, reflecting the market’s increased depth and capital inflow. Broader Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem The ramifications of this options activity extend far beyond trader portfolios. Firstly, it signals strong institutional belief in a near-term catalyst, such as potential regulatory clarity or ETF inflows. Secondly, it increases market fragility. A sudden price drop could lead to rapid unwinding of these leveraged positions, exacerbating downside volatility. Thirdly, it draws more traditional finance players into the crypto space, as they engage in complex volatility arbitrage and hedging strategies around these large options blocks. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing this derivatives activity. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have highlighted the need for robust risk management in crypto derivatives to protect investors and maintain systemic stability. The concentration of risk in specific strike prices and expiry dates, as seen with the January $100K calls, represents a known point of potential market stress. Key Metrics: Bitcoin $100K Jan Call Options Metric Value Significance Total Open Interest $1.45 Billion Scale of total bets Open Interest Maturing This Month $828 Million Immediate market impact 24-Hour Increase 420 BTC Momentum of new bets Critical Price Level (per QCP) $94,000 Potential trigger for gamma squeeze Deribit BTC Perp Funding Rate >30% annualized Indicator of extreme leverage Conclusion The aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin call options targeting a $100,000 price by January represents a defining moment for cryptocurrency markets. It is a high-stakes wager backed by billions in capital, driven by sophisticated market mechanics like gamma exposure and dealer hedging flows. While this activity reflects profound bullish conviction, it also layers significant leverage and complexity into the market structure. The coming weeks will critically test whether this options-driven momentum can propel Bitcoin to new heights or if it sets the stage for a violent correction. Regardless of the outcome, the scale of these Bitcoin options bets underscores the irreversible maturation of crypto into a complex, derivatives-heavy asset class where traditional market forces now play a decisive role. FAQs Q1: What is a Bitcoin call option? A Bitcoin call option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right to purchase Bitcoin at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiry). Traders use them to bet on price increases with limited downside risk (the premium paid). Q2: Why is the $100,000 strike price for January significant? The concentration of over $1.4 billion in open interest at this specific strike and expiry creates a major “options wall.” It becomes a focal point for market sentiment and can influence price action as dealers hedge their exposure, potentially creating a self-reinforcing move toward that target. Q3: What does “short gamma” mean for the market? When options dealers are “short gamma,” they must buy the underlying asset (Bitcoin) as its price rises to hedge their risk. This buying can accelerate upward price moves, creating a feedback loop known as a “gamma squeeze” that can lead to rapid, volatile rallies. Q4: What happens if Bitcoin does not reach $100,000 by January? If Bitcoin’s price is below $100,000 at the January expiry, all these call options will expire worthless. The buyers will lose the premiums they paid, and the dealers who sold the options will keep that premium as profit. This could lead to significant capital destruction for the option buyers. Q5: How does high perpetual futures funding relate to options activity? An extremely high funding rate (like 30%+) indicates that traders are heavily leveraged in perpetual futures contracts, betting on continued price rises. This often coincides with aggressive call option buying. Both are signs of overheated bullish sentiment and can contribute to increased market volatility and the potential for sharp corrections.

Artificial intelligence ( AI ) models appear to agree, as their latest projections likewise point to additional upside potential over the coming weeks The outlook is supported by Solana’s push above the $132 resistance level and a bullish trendline emerging near $135 at the time of writing, the highest level since December 12. Solana price improves, reclaims key technical levels Most notably, the MACD histogram turned positive at 1.87, while the 7-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) climbed to 74.7, indicating strong upside pressure. At the same time, a break above the 200-hour Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) near $134 also appeared to trigger algorithmic buying and short covering, accelerating the move. Broader market tailwinds added to the upside. Bitcoin ( BTC ), for instance, is holding well above $92,000, helping stabilize risk appetite, while major altcoins such as XRP are also advancing, helping the total cryptocurrency market capitalization rise to about $3.15 trillion. AI Solana price prediction for January 2026 With charts hinting at possible short-term gains, Finbold used its AI-driven price prediction tool to gauge Solana month-end price. Blending inputs from ChatGPT , Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4, the model outlined a range of bullish outcomes. Finbold AI SOL price forecast. Source: Finbold On average, the three models estimated Solana would reach $139.05 by the end of January, suggesting a 2.9% rise from where it currently trades. Claude Sonnet 4 provided the most bullish scenario, with a possible 5.45% advance, whereas Gemini 2.5 Flash and ChatGPT called for a 3.15% and 0.27% gain, respectively. Finbold AI SOL technical analysis. Source: Finbold Taken together, the technical setup and general sector stabilization reflected in the AI-driven forecast point to a largely bullish outlook for Solana into the end of January. If SOL can secure a daily close above $138, it could open the door toward the average predicted $139.05 and eventually $144.74, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level . Conversely, railure to hold the $132 threshold could prompt a pullback toward initial support at $130.

According to data compiled from on-chain trackers, spending moved from $14.6 million in January to $91.3 million by the end of December. Major Cards Driving The Growth Most of the rise was concentrated in a small group of cards. Data shows that EtherFi’s Visa card accounted for $55.4 million of the total, more than double second-place Cypher’s $20.5 million. The six cards tracked include offerings from GnosisPay, Cypher, EtherFi, Avici Money, Exa App, and Moonwell. Spending Patterns And Data Source Data from Dune Analytics shows the figures measure net spend on Visa-issued crypto cards run by blockchain projects partnering with Visa. The growth appears to be steady across the year rather than a single spike, with month-by-month net spend rising through 2025. According to Polygon researcher @obchakevich_ on X Sunday, these numbers show that crypto cards are gaining traction with users and highlight how important crypto and stablecoins have become for Visa’s worldwide payment network. . @Visa continues its expansion into crypto, steadily increasing spend volume through crypto cards such as @gnosispay , @ether_fi cash, @Cypher_HQ_ , @AviciMoney , @Exa_App , @MoonwellDeFi card, and others. Looking at the analytics for 6 crypto cards on Visa, we can see rapid… pic.twitter.com/Z5JzpBggI9 — Alex (@obchakevich_) January 4, 2026 What This Means For Payments Analysts and researchers say this jump suggests some crypto cards are moving into regular everyday use for certain groups of customers. Based on reports, cardholders are using crypto balances to pay for routine purchases instead of always converting to fiat first. That shift could make stablecoins and crypto rails more relevant for payments firms and banks. Visa Moves On Stablecoins And Advisory Work Visa has been active on the stablecoin front and has signaled plans to support broader stablecoin infrastructure for payments. Reports show Visa launched initiatives to help banks and partners build out stablecoin solutions and set up advisory work around tokenized money late in 2025. Those moves line up with the card-use data, which some observers see as a practical test of crypto payment flows at scale. Growth on a small set of cards does not mean mass adoption yet. Observers caution that regulation, consumer protection, and merchant acceptance remain key constraints. At the same time, the numbers do show that crypto-linked payments are no longer just a niche experiment; they are being used for real transactions by measurable groups of users.

On-Chain Data Reveals Surprise Resilience,https://cryptonews.com/news/us-venezuela-crisis-bitcoin-on-chain-data-resilience/,cryptonews,"Bitcoin markets showed little sign of panic over the weekend, despite the geopolitical risk exploding as a result of a dramatic escalation between the United States and Venezuela that culminated in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Although the headlines would normally shake risk assets, Bitcoin stood just below the $90,000 price , which brings the question as to whether there still is a possibility of a sudden sell-off or the market has become more resilient to geopolitical shocks. The price of Bitcoin held near the $90,000 level on Saturday, even as geopolitical tensions between the United States and Venezuela escalated. #Bitcoin #Venezuela https://t.co/9p6Nyb9hQ6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 4, 2026 Bitcoin Holds Steady as Venezuela Crisis Grips Global Headlines This happened later on Friday, when the US conducted airstrikes in and around Caracas and declared that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained and were flown to the United States. The US officials indicated that Maduro would be charged in New York in matters of narco-terrorism. The operation marked the most direct US military action in Latin America in decades and immediately dominated global news cycles. Yet Bitcoin’s reaction was muted as Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000 before stabilizing and recovering, ranging between $91,000 and $93,000 through the weekend. Source: TradingView The lack of panic stood out given the scale of the news and contrasted with past episodes where conflict headlines drove abrupt sell-offs. On-chain data helps explain the calm, as a recent CryptoQuant analysis focusing on Exchange Netflow, which tracks whether Bitcoin is moving onto or off exchanges, showed no surge in inflows linked to the Venezuela news. Source: CryptoQuant Historically, spikes in exchange inflows signal preparation to sell; this time, the data suggested otherwise. In past conflicts, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and flare-ups in the Middle East, prices were volatile, but sustained spikes in exchange inflows were limited. That pattern has persisted since 2023, suggesting investors increasingly treat localized military conflicts as short-term noise rather than systemic threats. That absence of inflows points to caution rather than fear, with holders choosing to sit tight instead of rushing for liquidity. Crypto Shorts Wiped Out as Downside Fears Fail to Land Derivatives data paints a similar picture, with Coinglass data showing that there were $257.3 million in crypto liquidations over the past 24 hours, driven largely by short positions. Source: Coinglass Roughly $182.6 million came from traders betting on price declines, while long liquidations totaled $74.7 million. The imbalance suggests recent price action moved against bearish positioning, reinforcing the idea that downside expectations tied to the conflict failed to materialize. The market’s calm reaction is also tied to how investors distinguish between different types of geopolitical risk. Historically, Bitcoin has responded more strongly to events that directly affect global capital flows, such as regulatory crackdowns, sanctions enforcement, or major US-China economic tensions . Trump threatened China with 155% tariffs starting Nov 1, following an $8.5B Australia minerals agreement. Over $329M in crypto liquidated. #China #Tariff #Australia https://t.co/nlagSWbX6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 21, 2025 By contrast, military actions confined to a single region have tended to cause brief volatility without altering broader market structure. That distinction matters in Venezuela’s case, particularly because the country is not just a geopolitical flashpoint but also a notable crypto holder. Publicly available data indicates the country holds at least 240 BTC, valued at roughly $22 million at current prices, as part of its reserves. Source: BitcoinTreasuries However, intelligence and market speculation point to far larger reserves accumulated over several years through sanctions workarounds. While those estimates remain unverified and contested, they have fueled discussion about what might occur should the authorities of the US ultimately seize or freeze any crypto assets tied to the Venezuelan government. Market participants noted that any confirmed US government seizure would most probably put the assets under long-term legal or custodial processing and leave them out of circulation and alleviate near-term supply pressure.

Finbold analysis shows Bitcoin lost over 7,000 millionaire wallets in 2025 as wealth concentrated among larger holders. Between January 1 and December 31, 2025, the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least $1 million fell by 7,485, leaving a total of 148,084 millionaire addresses by year-end. Data shows that Bitcoin millionaire addresses declined from 155,569 at the start of 2025 to 148,084 by December 31, even as spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted billions in inflows throughout the year. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Within that total, addresses holding $10 million or more actually increased, rising from 15,319 to 16,368, suggesting that wealth concentration intensified even as mid-tier millionaire wallets declined. On average, the net loss equates to approximately 21 Bitcoin millionaire addresses disappearing per day over the year. It is important to note that a single individual can control multiple Bitcoin addresses, meaning wallet counts do not map one-to-one with unique individuals. Still, the trend offers a useful proxy for changes in on-chain wealth distribution. A sharp reversal after a strong mid-year recovery The decline was not linear. By the end of Q3 2025 , Bitcoin had added a net 20,688 millionaire addresses year-to-date, driven by strong price momentum earlier in the year. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); However, the final quarter saw a pronounced reversal, wiping out earlier gains and pushing the full-year figure into negative territory. The data suggests that profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and late-year volatility played a significant role in the drawdown. Bitcoin ended 2025 lower despite institutional momentum The contraction in millionaire addresses occurred even as Bitcoin remained firmly embedded in institutional portfolios. Bitcoin began 2025 trading near $92,600 and ended the year closer to $87,100, reflecting a net price decline despite sustained demand through regulated investment vehicles. The divergence highlights a key theme of 2025, while institutional adoption accelerated, price appreciation failed to keep pace with earlier expectations, squeezing mid-range holders more than large allocators. Compared with 2024, which saw 56,325 new Bitcoin millionaire addresses , an average of 154 per day, 2025 marked a clear shift in on-chain wealth dynamics. Rather than broad-based wealth creation, the year was characterized by consolidation at the top, with larger holders increasing their footprint while smaller millionaire wallets exited. Finbold’s analysis suggests that 2025 was less a year of mass enrichment and more a period of redistribution, reinforcing the view that Bitcoin’s maturation increasingly favors scale, patience, and long-term capital over speculative cycles.

Gold Cooldown Signals Crypto Window,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-btc-time-gold-cooldown-signals-crypto-window/,cryptopotato,"Bitcoin is trading near $92,500 at press time, showing a 1% gain over the past day. The asset has now risen for five straight sessions, marking the longest upward streak since October. Meanwhile, trading volume has crossed $37 billion. Other large-cap assets like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have also posted gains between 0.7% and 3% in the past 24 hours. Gold Slows After Rally, Bitcoin Gains Attention Analysts are observing a pattern in how BTC and gold have behaved over past market cycles. Chart data from 2016 to 2026 shows that Bitcoin tends to rise after the precious metal peaks and slows down. This setup was seen around 2017 and again in 2020. Both periods followed gold reaching a local high before entering a period of lower activity. Michaël van de Poppe pointed out this recurring structure. He noted that gold’s strong run may now be cooling off. “It’s very expectable to see a corrective period on gold,” he said. He also described the next 1.5 to 2 years as a period when Bitcoin and crypto may see stronger price moves, similar to what followed previous gold peaks. In addition, BTC has broken above its earlier resistance and is trading near levels last seen before its recent correction. According to van de Poppe, the current zone near $93,000 is the last key area before a possible move toward $100,000. There we go! Final hurdle before $100K: that’s where #Bitcoin is currently at. I wouldn’t expect a clear-cut, immediate breakout; however, I do expect to see it happen in the coming week. The year started bullish. pic.twitter.com/E8XvJ3S3y9 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 5, 2026 While not expecting a fast breakout, he said a move higher may follow soon. Support levels have formed between $85,000 and $88,500. A deeper pullback could test the $80,500 range, which marked a double bottom last month. Rising trading volumes suggest buyers are active as Bitcoin approaches higher levels. Short-Term Moves and Market Focus Trader Merlijn stated that Bitcoin broke above $91,000 and is now holding above that mark. The asset targets mentioned include $93,000 and $94,600 in the near term. He said , “As long as $88.5K holds, the bias remains up. Lose it? We switch to damage control.” Daan Crypto Trades commented on the seasonal strength of Bitcoin in the first quarter. He said past Q1 periods, even in weaker years, have seen relatively steady performance. As the new year begins, analysts are watching to see if this trend continues. Price projections vary, with some analysts forecasting new highs above $126,000 or even reaching $210,000 later this year. The post Bitcoin’s (BTC) Time?

Data from CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, revealed on January 4 that only OKX (+0.001), Kraken (+0.004), and Upbit (+0.062) showed positive December monthly averages out of the ten top exchanges. The remaining seven all showed a negative buying power ratio. Bitget showed the lowest buying power ratio of -1.2083. On the favorable buying power ratio. Upbit exchange showed the highest positive buying power ratio of 0.4209. Buying power weakens as regional capital splits On-chain data revealed that Upbit barely sustained positive buying strength at 0.4209, while Coinbase advanced recorded -0.0878, and Kraken was near-neutral at -0.0119. In December, regional capital patterns showed divergence. Although there has been a slight improvement in the buying power ratios, deployment is still insufficient to create strong convictions. Crypto exchanges reveal negative buying power ratios, reflecting dominant selling pressure. Source: CryptoQuant As of January 3, Binance posted a modest increase in the buying power ratio from -0.093 in late December to 0.064. Binance recovered in late December, rising from -0.277 to positive 0.059 before falling. In the month, the weekly decline reached a peak of -0.200 on December 21 before turning around. CryptoQuant revealed that professionals are lowering exposures rather than increasing positions despite Bitcoin stabilizing at $90,000. A CryptoQuant expert clarified that the buying power ratio is used to compare the velocity of BTC withdrawals with stablecoin capital inflow . The analyst further explained that the negative buying power ratios indicate that inflow capital is leaving faster than it is arriving. Stablecoin saw net inflows of $436 million and outflows of $3.7 billion in December of last year, yielding a ratio of 0.117. The ratio of 0.117 was the first positive result since early December, despite being much below the 1.0 level, which indicates a true accumulation zone. The 30-day ratio remained at -0.126 level. At the -0.126 level, stablecoins experienced $1.96 billion in withdrawals compared to $15.6 billion in BTC withdrawals. Over different periods, the same weakening ratio was seen. In a period of 365 days, the weakening ratio remained at 0.067, and 90 days at 0.105. Binance saw a mean monthly inflow of 21.7 BTC last month. The monthly inflow has risen from 0.86 in early January 2024, two years ago. The average size of each deposit has increased by 34 times. Average BTC per incoming transaction metrics revealed that whales are now more active on Binance . Exchange Bitcoin reserves decrease as consolidation rises The CryptoQuant data revealed that there has been professional consolidation on leading exchanges and a slight supply reduction at the same time. On January 4, CryptoQuant reported how exchange reserves movements reflect a comparable pattern of supply concentration, with BTC increasing its move onto top-tier platforms. CryptoQuant analyzed that Coinbase gained while the exchange Bitcoin reserves dropped by 6,650 coins weekly. The exchange Bitcoin reserves dropped by $612 million as a result of a 6,650 coin decline. Seven out of ten leading exchanges had outflows, according to on-chain statistics, resulting in a net loss of 0.293%. The 0.293% decline indicates a modest tightening of supply that sustains a long-term positive structure without indicating an immediate effect on pricing. CryptoQuant revealed that Coinbase reported a 1,648 BTC increase by the end of last month. Binance saw a 4,684 BTC absolute decline. At 3,872 BTC, Kraken experienced the second-largest absolute decrease. Smaller exchanges like KuCoin and Gate.io experienced weekly drops of 3.59% and 3.66%, respectively. Total exchange reserves are currently at 2.27 million BTC worth $209 billion. Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are the top 3 exchanges that control almost 82.7% of the total exchange reserves concentration. Coinbase and Binance have structural dominance with a combined reserve of 65.4%.

Also, 87 of the top 100 coins have gone up over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $101 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap is up 1% (Monday morning, UTC); 87 of the top 100 coins and 9 of the top 10 coins went up today; BTC increased by 1.2% to $92,483, and ETH is up 0.5% to $3,155; Crypto markets are ‘in the green as investors add digital gold to their portfolios’; A resurgence the memecoin interest led to a shift in mood across the space; Geopolitical tensions are rising; A flurry of data is coming out this week from the US; Vitalik Buterin unveiled the ZK-EVM and PeerDAS roadmap; PwC is pushing deeper into crypto after years of cautious stance; Whales deposited some $2.4 billion to Binance; US BTC and ETH spot ETFs began 2026 with inflows of $471.14 million and $174.43 million, respectively; Crypto market sentiment finally re-entered the neutral zone. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing on Monday morning, 9 of the top 10 coins per market capitalisation have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is up by 1.2% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $92,483. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 0.5%, now changing hands at $3,155. The category’s highest increase is 2.9% by XRP , currently standing at $2.13. It’s followed by Binance Coin (BNB)’s 1.6% to the price of $898. At the same time, Tron (TRX) saw the lowest rise, with a change of 0.3%, now standing at $0.2949. The only red coin is Dogecoin (DOGE) , having decreased by 0.9% to $0.1502. When it comes to the top 100 coins, 87 coins saw increases. Of these, one is double-digit. Render (RENDER) appreciated 16% to $2.1. Bonk (BONK) is next with a 6.2% increase to $0.00001211. On the other hand, Provenance Blockchain (HASH) fell the most: 10.2% to $0.02653. Canton (CC) is next, having decreased by 6% to the price of $0.1462. Meanwhile, the big four accounting firm PwC is pushing deeper into crypto after years of a cautious stance. “The Genius Act and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class,” Paul Griggs, PwC’s US senior partner, said. “The tokenization of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem.” Moreover, Vitalik Buterin said Ethereum solved blockchain’s trilemma via zero-knowledge EVMs and PeerDAS technology. This enables decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, “shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote. Now that ZKEVMs are at alpha stage (production-quality performance, remaining work is safety) and PeerDAS is live on mainnet, it's time to talk more about what this combination means for Ethereum. These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2026 ‘Investors Add Digital Gold to Their Portfolios’ Petr Kozyakov, Co-Founder and CEO at payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo , commented that crypto markets are “in the green as investors add digital gold to their portfolios amid positioning for the year ahead.” Bitcoin has surpassed $92,000, leading the market higher with Ethereum and Solana also recording gains. Per the CEO, “a shift in mood across the digital token space has been underlined by a resurgence in interest in the meme coin sector, with Shiba Inu and Pepe making a loud entry to 2026.” “While the cryptocurrency space experienced a severe drop in sentiment in the final months of 2025, fundamentals in the sector remain strong as the underlying infrastructure evolves with assets such as stablecoins continuing to attract increasing levels of liquidity,” Kozyakov wrote. Moreover, Derivatives Desk of Laser Digital noted that we’ll see “a flurry of jobs data out this week,” coming from the US. Most importantly, the non-farm payrolls (NFP) data is out on Friday, they added, and consensus is headline number +55,000 and Unemployment Rate (UER) 4.50%. Given that January cuts are barely priced now, “a weak number would likely trigger market to price more cuts for January and push the yields lower.” “Expect UER to matter more than headline number like last time. A higher UER could be negative for risk assets given most investors are expecting goldilocks scenario on US economy,” they said. Moreover, “geopolitical tension has been rising as well. So far, the market reaction to the weekend events has been muted, but it could have some spillover effect on places that are already under tension.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Monday morning, BTC stood at $92,483. For the majority of the past 24 hours, the coin traded sideways at the $91,000 level. It then jumped from $91,138 to the intraday high of $93,169. Over the past seven days, BTC appreciated 2.9%, moving between $86,979 and $92,999. It’s also up by 3.1% in a month and down by 5.8% in a year and 26.6% from its all-time high. If Bitcoin keeps the level above $90,000, it could run to and above $93,500 and $94,600. This would open doors towards the $98,000 zone in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,155. Much like BTC, ETH traded sideways at the $3,100 level for much of the past day. The price surged from the intraday low of $3,123 to the high of $3,209. Looking at the past week, we find a 4.1% increase. The coin moved within the $2,916 – $3,198 range. It’s up just below 4% in a month and is down 13% in a year and 36.2% from its all-time high. If ETH pushes above $3,430, it could see a further rise to $3,600 and $4,000 later in the year. Yet, a fall below $3,010 could see it pull back below $3,000. That said, Buterin unveiling the ZK-EVM and PeerDAS roadmap could strengthen the long-term outlook with strong fundamentals and tech innovation. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Moreover, as the new year began, the crypto market sentiment has seen a high enough increase to finally exit the fear territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 42 today , compared to its lowest point over the past month of just 21. It is now back into the neutral zone, for the first time since October. This isn’t to say that market participants aren’t still cautious. However, they seem to be more optimistic about the short- and mid-term outlooks. ETFs Start 2026 With Inflows The first trading day of the year, Friday, 2 January, saw the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posting positive flows of $471.14 million . The total net inflow now stands at $57.08 billion. Of the twelve BTC ETFs, nine saw inflows, and none recorded outflows. BlackRock posted the highest amount of $287.37 million. It’s followed by Fidelity’s $88.08 million and Bitwise’s $41.49 million. Moreover, the US ETH ETFs also posted positive flows, with $174.43 million on 2 January. The total net inflow hovers around $12.5 billion. Five of the nine funds recorded inflows, and none posted outflows. Grayscale took in $103.72 million in total on this day. Moreover, BlackRock recorded $47.16 million in inflows. Meanwhile, according to on-chain data cited by CryptoOnchain , whales deposited some $2.4 billion to Binance , split nearly evenly between Bitcoin and Ether. However, analysts noted that “crucially, this surge in risk-asset deposits was not accompanied by new buying power.” Bitcoin Inflows to Binance are Increasingly Whale-Sized “A 34x increase in the average size of each deposit. This metric reflects the average BTC per inflow transaction, signaling that larger holders are now more active on Binance.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/SkpgMUG8vP — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 4, 2026 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today?

However, according to ESG researcher Daniel Batten’s Saturday X article, there are nine theories about crypto that are dumbfounding. Batten vehemently disagreed with how the Dow Jones blasted Harvard University for allocating part of its endowment to a “fake currency and money-laundering tool that is also an environmental catastrophe.“ “Every nascent disruptive technology is accompanied by claims that are based on lack of understanding, lack of data, and a fear of something unknown. This happened to the bicycle, the radio, and the Internet. It has also happened with Bitcoin mining,” he wrote. Batten: Energy misuse and electronic waste claims are unfounded One of the accusations the article cited was that Bitcoin consumes excessive energy, water, and is leading in electronic waste per transaction. Batten said the theory is fundamentally flawed and has been rejected by four peer-reviewed papers, alongside assessments by Cambridge University. The studies conclude that Bitcoin’s resource use is not driven by transaction volume, which means transaction throughput can increase without drawing excessive energy, water, or hardware consumption. The per-transaction metric’s origin came from Alex de Vries’ “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem” commentary published in 2018. Batten insists the analysis was non-empirical, and it was later discredited, even though several media agencies had already consumed the perception as reality. In his analytical critique of Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption , De Vries measured energy per transaction and extended the same methodology to emissions, water use, and electronic waste. Cambridge University later found the Digiconomist founder had overestimated Bitcoin mining’s electronic waste by 1,204%, placing annual eWaste at 2.3 kilotonnes and below de Vries’ 30 kilotonnes. Bitcoin does not destabilize electricity grids and increase prices Batten also debunked the myth about Bitcoin mining causing a distortion in power grids through research from Duke University. The North Carolina learning institution concluded that controllable load resources like the crypto coin’s mining can instead stabilize grids. These findings are supported by data from ERCOT, the Texas grid operator of the largest concentration of Bitcoin mining in the world. According to ERCOT records, Bitcoin miners provide frequency regulation and demand response services. During Texas’s July 2022 heatwave, mining operations reportedly cut back energy demand during grid stress and helped prevent outages. ERCOT documented only one mild grid-destabilizing incident, which came in April 2024. “Bitcoin mining operations have found a way to come into the market and take some of that excess wind in off-peak periods. Then it can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers… And if a generator trips offline, it can very quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid more efficiently,” said former ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones. On the energy consumption side of the criticism, Batten compared US electricity cost data from 2021 to 2024, showing inflation-adjusted increases of 7.7% nationally and 7.0% in Texas. He said no peer-reviewed study supports the claim that Bitcoin mining raises consumer power prices, but there are cases where it can lower costs, including reducing curtailment fees and investments in gas peaker plants. In September 2024, Norwegian residents reportedly learned that Bitcoin mining had kept power prices 20% lower for years, before prices jumped after miners exited the grid. CNBC reported that adding a Bitcoin mine to rural microgrids in Kenya reduced electricity costs from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to 25 cents. Carbon emissions, renewable energy, and methane mitigation Cambridge University also stated that comparing industries to nations is “presenter bias,” because environmental policy focuses on transforming energy systems rather than reducing absolute consumption. Moreover, per Batten’s own assessment, Bitcoin mining is the only global industry with third-party data showing more than 50% sustainable energy usage and emissions at 39.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The ESG researcher propounded that Bitcoin mining produces only indirect emissions from electricity use, similar to electric vehicles. EVs produced 80 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in China and the United States alone. BTC mining emissions chart. Source: Cambridge University Batten also rejected assertions that mining diverts renewable energy from other users, saying ERCOT data and Brad Jones coined mining a “non-rival energy user” that powers down when prices rise. Concluding his rebuttal piece, he shared peer-reviewed studies of mining integration that almost fully eliminate wasted energy on microgrids while cutting operating costs by 46.5%.

This strategic pivot, first reported by Cointelegraph, transforms digital asset access from a reactive service into a proactive portfolio strategy. Consequently, the move signals a profound shift in how major traditional financial institutions perceive and integrate Bitcoin investment vehicles. Moreover, it provides millions of clients with guided, mainstream exposure to the cryptocurrency market through regulated and familiar financial products. Bank of America’s Strategic Shift on Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bank of America’s new policy represents a decisive evolution from its previous, restrictive stance. Previously, advisors could only facilitate transactions for spot Bitcoin ETFs on an unsolicited basis. This meant that highly qualified investor clients had to initiate the request themselves. Now, advisors possess the explicit authorization to suggest these products directly. They can recommend specific allocations, typically between 1% and 4% of a client’s portfolio. This framework treats cryptocurrency exposure as a strategic asset class rather than a speculative outlier. The bank has officially sanctioned a select group of spot Bitcoin ETFs for recommendation. This curated list includes some of the largest and most liquid funds in the market: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT): The largest spot Bitcoin ETF by assets, managed by the world’s biggest asset manager. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): A major offering from the giant financial services firm. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): Known for its focus on transparency and low fees. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC): A spin-off from the massive Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), designed with a competitive fee structure. This selection process underscores the bank’s focus on credibility, liquidity, and institutional-grade custody solutions. Furthermore, it provides a clear, vetted pathway for advisors navigating a rapidly growing sector. The Broader Context of Institutional Crypto Adoption Bank of America’s policy change does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, it reflects a broader, accelerating trend of institutional acceptance following regulatory milestones. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 served as the critical catalyst. Since that pivotal moment, these funds have amassed tens of billions of dollars in assets under management. They have demonstrated robust market infrastructure and daily trading volumes that rival many established equity ETFs. Other major wirehouses and registered investment advisor (RIA) platforms have undertaken similar, though often more cautious, evaluations. For instance, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are reportedly conducting due diligence on allowing broker-sold access. Bank of America’s move, however, is particularly significant due to its scale. With thousands of advisors and trillions in client assets, its endorsement carries substantial weight. It effectively normalizes Bitcoin exposure within the framework of traditional financial planning. Analyzing the Recommended Allocation Strategy The suggested 1% to 4% portfolio allocation is a calculated approach rooted in modern portfolio theory. Financial analysts often cite this range as a “satellite” or “tactical” allocation. It aims to provide potential diversification benefits and non-correlated return streams without introducing excessive volatility to the overall portfolio. This recommendation aligns with guidance from several prominent investment strategists and economists who have long argued for a small, strategic allocation to digital assets. Advisors will likely base the exact percentage on a client’s individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial goals. The allocation framework provides a structured, disciplined method for incorporating a high-growth, high-volatility asset. It moves the conversation away from speculative trading and towards long-term strategic asset allocation. Implications for Financial Advisors and the Wealth Management Industry This policy shift places new responsibilities and opportunities squarely on the desks of Bank of America’s financial advisors. Advisors must now educate themselves comprehensively on Bitcoin’s fundamentals, the mechanics of spot ETFs, and their associated risks. They need to understand custody differences, fee structures, and tax implications to provide competent advice. The bank will undoubtedly roll out extensive training programs and compliance guidelines to support this transition. For the wealth management industry at large, this move creates competitive pressure. Other major institutions may accelerate their own plans to offer similar advisory services to retain clients and advisors. The table below outlines the potential immediate impacts: Stakeholder Primary Impact Bank of America Advisors Gain a new tool for client portfolios and a topic for proactive client engagement. BofA Clients Receive guided, convenient access to crypto within their existing advisory relationship. Spot Bitcoin ETF Issuers (IBIT, FBTC, etc.) Access a massive new distribution channel and inflow potential from advised assets. Competitor Firms (Morgan Stanley, UBS, etc.) Face increased urgency to formulate and announce their own advisory policies. The Cryptocurrency Market Benefits from enhanced legitimacy and a steady, long-term demand source from institutional portfolios. This development could significantly increase the stability of Bitcoin markets. Advisory-driven investments typically follow a dollar-cost averaging approach rather than speculative timing. Therefore, they may contribute to reduced volatility over the long term. Navigating Risks and Regulatory Compliance Despite this progressive step, Bank of America and its advisors must operate within a strict regulatory environment. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the SEC continue to emphasize the importance of suitability and risk disclosure. Advisors must ensure that any recommendation for a spot Bitcoin ETF aligns with a client’s investment profile. They have a duty to clearly explain the unique risks of the underlying asset, including extreme price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and technological risks. The bank’s compliance department will have established rigorous procedures for these conversations. Documentation of client understanding and explicit consent will be paramount. This measured, compliant rollout is characteristic of how large institutions integrate innovative but complex products. It prioritizes investor protection while gradually expanding access. Conclusion Bank of America’s authorization for its advisors to recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a pivotal moment in finance. It bridges the once-distant worlds of traditional wealth management and digital asset investment. By providing a structured, percentage-based allocation framework through approved funds like IBIT and FBTC, the bank is institutionalizing cryptocurrency exposure. This decision will likely catalyze further adoption across the advisory landscape, bringing a new wave of long-term, strategic capital into the ecosystem. Ultimately, it represents a mature next phase for spot Bitcoin ETFs, transitioning them from novel products to potential portfolio staples for a broader investor base. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Bank of America change regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bank of America changed its internal policy from only allowing advisors to execute unsolicited client requests for spot Bitcoin ETFs to now permitting advisors to proactively recommend and allocate these ETFs as part of a client’s portfolio strategy. Q2: Which specific spot Bitcoin ETFs can Bank of America advisors recommend? Advisors are officially guided to recommend four specific funds: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). Q3: What is the recommended allocation to cryptocurrency in a portfolio? Bank of America’s guidance suggests advisors consider an allocation of approximately 1% to 4% of a client’s total portfolio to spot Bitcoin ETFs, depending on the individual’s risk profile and investment objectives. Q4: How does this differ from what other major banks are doing? While several other large banks are exploring or allowing limited transactions, Bank of America’s move to explicitly empower its nationwide advisor force to make recommendations is among the most direct and significant endorsements from a major wirehouse to date. Q5: Does this mean Bank of America is bullish on Bitcoin? The policy change indicates that Bank of America recognizes client demand and the strategic role Bitcoin ETFs can play in diversified portfolios. It is a service and product adoption decision based on regulatory developments and market maturity, rather than a direct price opinion on Bitcoin itself.

The leading cryptocurrencies could rally higher in the near term as the bulls take full control of the market. Financial markets react to the US operations in Venezuela The cryptocurrency market has started the new year on a bullish note, with Bitcoin adding over 3% to its value in the last seven days. The positive performance has seen Bitcoin hit the $93k level a few hours ago and could rally higher in the near term. The rally comes as the cryptocurrency market reacts to the United States’ operation in Venezuela. While speaking to The Block. Min Jung, research associate of Presto Research, stated that BTC’s performance aligns with the rally recorded by the broader financial markets. The analyst added that, “The first week of the new year often sees fresh positioning from investors, and bitcoin is likely being viewed as an attractive entry point at current levels. Traders are also closely monitoring geopolitical developments, which remain a key source of potential volatility across global markets.” The United States carried out an operation in Venezuela over the weekend, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Maduro and his wife were flown to the United States and will appear in federal court at noon later today. In a press conference on Saturday, President Trump stated that the US would run Venezuela temporarily during the transition, and “get the oil flowing.” He added that the US is now in charge of Venezuela. Secretary of State Marco Rubio pointed out on Sunday that the US doesn’t plan to directly govern Venezuela. However, it will continue to enforce an “oil quarantine” as part of a plan to influence policy. Bitcoin eyes the $95k resistance level The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish but inefficient as the cryptocurrency has rallied over the past few days. BTC’s price closed above the upper consolidation range of $90,000 on Saturday and has surged to tap the $93k level late on Sunday. This is Bitcoin’s highest level since December 12 and has surged almost 6% in 2026. At press time, BTC is trading around $92,900 per coin. If the bullish trend continues, BTC could extend the rally toward the next resistance at $94,253, with a liquidity level at $95k also a target. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart reads 74, above the neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum is gaining traction. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover above the neutral level, further supporting the bullish outlook. However, if the bulls fail to overcome the $94k resistance level, Bitcoin could face a correction and decline toward the key support level at $90,000.

BTC Eyes to Reclaim $93K Following the brutal ending of 2025, with a massive price slump from over $126,000 in early October to below $88,000 as of December 31, bitcoin’s price finally began to show revival signs as of January 2. The asset quickly jumped past $88,000 and aimed at $90,000 on Friday, where it saw some resistance at first but managed to reclaim that level even after the US attacked Venezuela and captured its president. On Saturday and Sunday, BTC was slowly climbing and tapped $91,500 yesterday. Monday morning began with another price increase, this time to just under $93,500, which became its highest price tag since December 12. It was stopped there and now sits just inches below $93,000, but it’s still 1.6% up on the day. Its market capitalization has risen by $100 billion since January 1 and now sits above $1.850 trillion.

The audit, commissioned by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund and funded by Brink, identified only two low-severity issues across the peer-to-peer layer, mempool, and consensus logic. A month earlier, Bitcoin Core released version 30.0 , removing the 80-byte OP_RETURN limit, increasing the default data carrier size to 100,000 bytes, and allowing multiple OP_RETURN outputs per transaction. Adam Back, Blockstream CEO, defended the update as containing essential security patches from “ 200 most skilled people on the planet ,” while critics warned of spam risks and potential legal liabilities.

At the same time, MSTR’s weekly chart shows continued weakness, with oversold momentum building after a long slide. Jeff Walton flags $STRC “par” test as Bitcoin holds range Jeff Walton said the ticker $STRC could trade near $100 for the next nine trading sessions if Bitcoin’s current price action stays intact. Walton posted the view on X on Monday, tying the projection directly to whether Bitcoin can keep holding its recent range. He also pointed to the last time $STRC “hit par,” which he said happened in early November and lasted about four trading days. Walton said that stretch coincided with roughly $100 million in ATM sales, shorthand for at the market share issuance. Walton framed the current setup as a repeatable pattern that could matter for liquidity and issuance activity if the stock returns to the same level. He added that an “Amplified Bitcoin” trade looked set to resume, although the post did not provide additional data beyond the timing and the prior ATM figure. $MSTR slides under long term averages as weekly RSI hits 26 Meanwhile, Strategy’s stock $MSTR stayed under pressure on the weekly chart, and the latest candles held below the major moving averages shown by TrendSpider. The chart plots the 50 week EMA near 276.53, the 100 week EMA near 246.91, and the 200 week EMA near 183.82, while price trades well beneath all three.

The weekly RSI(14) on the chart sits around 26.57, which TrendSpider referenced with the question, “Have we reached despair yet?” That print places RSI deep into oversold territory on this scale, showing heavy downside momentum.

The rebound has helped stabilize short-term sentiment, but confidence remains fragile. Many analysts continue to warn that 2026 could evolve into a broader bear market, citing weak spot demand, fading momentum, and persistent sell-side activity from larger participants. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Setup Advances: CEX Volume Hits Cycle Highs Despite Price Weakness Against this backdrop, macro headlines have re-entered the conversation. An analysis from XWIN Research Japan points to reports of a potential US military intervention in Venezuela, which have revived geopolitical risk concerns across global markets. Historically, such developments tend to increase volatility and push investors toward defensive positioning. However, Bitcoin’s reaction cannot be judged by price alone, particularly in an environment dominated by derivatives and algorithmic flows. On-chain behavior offers a more precise lens. Exchange Netflow data is especially relevant during periods of geopolitical stress, as it reflects whether holders are preparing to sell or choosing to stay sidelined. When fear dominates, exchange inflows typically surge as participants move coins onto platforms. Conversely, muted inflows or continued outflows suggest that investors are not rushing to reduce exposure, even amid unsettling headlines. Exchange Netflows Suggest Caution, Not Panic The analysis places the current geopolitical headlines into a broader historical context. During past military conflicts—most notably Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and more recent flare-ups in the Middle East—Bitcoin often experienced sharp but short-lived price volatility. However, on-chain data told a calmer story. Exchange Netflow, which captures whether coins are being moved onto exchanges to sell or withdrawn for holding, rarely deteriorated in a sustained way during those events. Since 2023, the market has shown a growing ability to absorb localized geopolitical shocks without triggering widespread liquidation behavior. The situation surrounding Venezuela appears consistent with that pattern. While headlines have introduced uncertainty and contributed to short-term price sensitivity, there is no meaningful surge of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges. The absence of elevated inflows suggests that investors are not reacting with panic. Instead, the market seems to be monitoring developments while maintaining existing exposure. Historically, Bitcoin’s more pronounced on-chain reactions have been tied to structural economic threats rather than isolated military actions. Events such as US–China trade tensions, aggressive regulatory shifts, or capital control measures tend to impact global liquidity and investor freedom more directly, leaving clearer footprints in exchange flows. At this stage, the Venezuela narrative has not crossed into that category. Exchange Netflow behavior indicates a market on alert, but not in retreat.

On the chart, this move stands out as a relief rally following a sharp breakdown from the $105,000–$110,000 region earlier in Q4. However, the broader structure still reflects a market in consolidation rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Price is currently trading below the declining short-term moving average (blue), which has acted as dynamic resistance since the November sell-off. While BTC has managed to reclaim ground above the 200-day moving average (red), this level is still relatively flat, signaling stabilization rather than renewed bullish momentum. The medium-term moving average (green) around the $100,000 area remains a critical barrier that bulls have not yet challenged meaningfully. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning The recent bounce occurred with moderate participation, lacking the expansion typically associated with strong trend continuation. This suggests short covering and tactical buying rather than broad-based demand returning to the market. Structurally, Bitcoin appears to be forming a range between roughly $88,000 and $96,000. Holding above the lower bound would keep the consolidation intact, while a failure back below $88,000 would reopen downside risk toward the mid-$80,000s. For now, the price action reflects relief and stabilization, but confirmation of a sustainable uptrend still requires a decisive reclaim of higher resistance levels.

56848658,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258455,1767614412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"American Bitcoin’s Strategic 5,427 BTC Reserve Signals Major Institutional Confidence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/american-bitcoin-5427-btc-holdings/,bitcoinworld,"BitcoinWorld American Bitcoin’s Strategic 5,427 BTC Reserve Signals Major Institutional Confidence In a significant disclosure for the cryptocurrency sector, American Bitcoin (ABTC), the mining venture founded by Eric Trump, confirmed it holds a substantial reserve of 5,427 Bitcoin (BTC) as of January 2, 2025. This announcement, made from the company’s operational base, provides a rare and transparent look into the balance sheet of a prominent institutional miner. Consequently, it highlights the evolving strategy where mining firms are not just producers but also long-term custodians of digital value. The revelation arrives during a period of intense focus on Bitcoin’s role within traditional finance and corporate treasury management. American Bitcoin’s Substantial 5,427 BTC Treasury American Bitcoin’s (ABTC) confirmed holding of 5,427 BTC represents a major financial position within the cryptocurrency mining industry. Based on prevailing market valuations, this reserve translates to a digital asset treasury worth several hundred million dollars. The company, established by Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has positioned itself as a significant player in North America’s energy-intensive mining sector. Furthermore, this disclosure follows a trend among publicly traded miners to report their Bitcoin holdings transparently for investor clarity. The company likely accumulated these coins through a combination of block rewards and strategic market purchases. This practice, often called ‘HODLing,’ indicates a strong long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Many industry analysts view such reserves as a bullish signal for underlying network strength. The Strategic Rationale Behind Mining Reserves Mining companies like American Bitcoin face a fundamental strategic choice: sell mined Bitcoin for immediate operational capital or hold it as a treasury asset. Holding a large reserve, such as 5,427 BTC, suggests a specific corporate philosophy. Primarily, it acts as a hedge against fiat currency inflation and a bet on Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation. Additionally, these holdings can serve as collateral for securing low-interest debt or financing further infrastructure expansion. For instance, other major miners like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms have employed similar strategies with their sizable BTC treasuries. This approach transforms a mining operation from a pure commodity producer into a hybrid digital asset company. The decision reflects a deep integration of Bitcoin’s monetary properties into the firm’s core financial strategy. Therefore, ABTC’s reserve is not merely an inventory but a deliberate balance sheet optimization. Contextualizing the 5,427 BTC Figure To understand the scale of American Bitcoin’s 5,427 BTC holding, comparative analysis is essential. This reserve places ABTC among the top tier of private Bitcoin mining companies by treasury size, though still behind the largest public entities. For context, the entire Bitcoin network currently creates 900 new BTC every day through mining rewards. ABTC’s holdings represent the equivalent of roughly six days of total new global Bitcoin supply. When compared to corporate treasuries, this stash is significantly larger than the Bitcoin purchases made by several mainstream public companies in recent years. The holding also underscores the massive capital intensity and operational scale required for modern Bitcoin mining. It signals that ABTC has successfully navigated the industry’s volatility to amass and retain a valuable asset base. This achievement points to robust operational management and strategic financial discipline. Eric Trump’s Role and the Broader Industry Landscape Eric Trump’s founding of American Bitcoin situates the company within a notable political and business narrative. While the venture operates independently, its association brings heightened public and media scrutiny to its disclosures and performance. The mining industry itself has undergone a dramatic geographical shift, often called the ‘Great Mining Migration,’ with a significant portion of hash rate now located in North America. This shift prioritizes energy sourcing, regulatory compliance, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting. American Bitcoin’s operations are part of this broader trend toward institutionalization and professionalization. The company’s decision to publicly disclose its BTC holdings aligns with increasing demands for transparency from investors and regulators alike. Moreover, it demonstrates how cryptocurrency mining is maturing into a standardized sector of the global energy and technology industries. Implications for Market Perception and Volatility The public knowledge of large, illiquid holdings like American Bitcoin’s 5,427 BTC can influence market dynamics. Such reserves represent potential future supply, but their strategic ‘HODL’ status means they are unlikely to be sold on the open market impulsively. This reduces immediate selling pressure and can contribute to price stability. However, analysts closely monitor the spending habits of large holders, as any significant movement can signal strategic shifts. The disclosure also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the health and strategy of other private mining firms. For the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, substantial institutional holdings validate Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. They demonstrate that sophisticated operators are willing to allocate significant capital and retain exposure over extended periods. This institutional confidence can, in turn, influence investment decisions across the wider digital asset space. Regulatory and Accounting Considerations Holding 5,427 BTC as a corporate asset introduces complex regulatory and accounting challenges. In the United States, guidance from bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to evolve. Companies must choose whether to classify Bitcoin as an indefinite-lived intangible asset or under new fair-value accounting rules. This classification significantly impacts quarterly earnings reports, as impairment charges or mark-to-market gains create volatility in stated profits. American Bitcoin’s disclosure indicates it is navigating this complex landscape, likely with specialized legal and financial advisory. Furthermore, as a holder of a substantial cryptocurrency reserve, the company must implement enterprise-grade security protocols, including multi-signature wallets and custody solutions. These operational necessities underscore the maturity required to manage such a digital asset treasury effectively. Conclusion American Bitcoin’s confirmation of a 5,427 BTC treasury reserve marks a pivotal moment for institutional transparency in the cryptocurrency mining industry. This substantial holding, reported by the Eric Trump-founded venture, reflects a strategic commitment to Bitcoin’s long-term value and signifies the sector’s ongoing maturation. The move aligns with broader trends of corporate Bitcoin adoption, sophisticated treasury management, and the professionalization of digital asset operations. As regulatory frameworks solidify and market infrastructure develops, disclosures like this will become increasingly standard, providing clearer insights into the financial bedrock of the Bitcoin network. Ultimately, American Bitcoin’s reserve is a strong vote of confidence in the asset’s enduring role within the future of global finance. FAQs Q1: What is American Bitcoin (ABTC)?

Q3: How do mining companies typically use their Bitcoin reserves? Mining companies may use Bitcoin reserves as a long-term store of value, collateral for securing loans to fund expansion, or to cover operational expenses during market downturns without selling equity. The strategy depends on their financial outlook and market conditions. Q4: Does Eric Trump’s involvement affect the company’s operations? While Eric Trump is the founder, American Bitcoin operates as a separate business entity. His involvement brings public attention, but the company’s strategy and disclosures are likely driven by standard industry practices and financial considerations. Q5: What does this mean for the average Bitcoin investor? For the average investor, large institutional holdings like this can be seen as a sign of confidence, potentially reducing circulating supply and supporting long-term price stability. It also demonstrates the growing integration of Bitcoin into traditional corporate finance models.

56848817,653635,1767614439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56848817.jpeg,Bitcoin Warning Signal Emerges: Whale Deposits Rise And Accumulation Slows,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-warning-signal-emerges-whale-deposits-rise/,bitcoinist,"Bitcoin has pushed back above the $92,000 level after several days of steady buying pressure, offering investors a sense of short-term relief following weeks of choppy and directionless price action. The rebound suggests that demand has not fully disappeared, yet the broader technical picture remains unresolved. Despite the recent strength, BTC is still trading below key structural levels that would normally confirm a sustained continuation of the broader uptrend, keeping market participants cautious about calling a definitive trend shift. Adding complexity to the outlook, a recent CryptoQuant report by CryptoOnchain highlights a notable divergence in Binance flow data that deserves attention. The analysis compares the average size of Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on the exchange since October and points to a growing imbalance beneath the surface. On one side, the average inflow size has increased sharply, implying that larger holders are moving more BTC onto exchanges. On the other, average outflows remain subdued, signaling weaker accumulation behavior and limited movement into long-term storage. This divergence introduces a potential headwind for price, as it suggests that selling capacity is building faster than conviction to hold. While price action has improved in the short term, on-chain flows indicate that the market may still be vulnerable if demand fails to strengthen further. Bitcoin Whale Flows Signal Rising Supply Risk The report points to a meaningful shift in how large Bitcoin holders are interacting with exchanges, and the change is not neutral. Data tracking the average size of deposits into Binance shows a sharp jump over recent months. Transactions flowing into the exchange are no longer clustered around smaller sizes; instead, they increasingly reflect much larger transfers. This pattern is typically associated with whales positioning liquidity, a behavior that often precedes distribution rather than long-term holding. When large amounts of BTC are moved onto exchanges, it raises the probability that supply will soon be available to the market. At the same time, the opposite side of the equation looks notably weak. Average withdrawal sizes have failed to recover meaningfully since their decline in October. While there has been a modest rebound, outflows remain far below previous levels, suggesting that large investors are not aggressively moving coins into cold storage. This lack of follow-through on withdrawals implies muted conviction in longer-term accumulation. Taken together, these two trends form an uncomfortable divergence. Selling capacity appears to be growing, while evidence of strategic accumulation remains limited. This does not guarantee immediate downside, but it does tilt the risk profile against sustained upside momentum. As long as large inflows dominate and outflows stay suppressed, Bitcoin may struggle to build a durable rally without a clear improvement in underlying demand. Price Stabilizes, But Structural Resistance Persists Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after a sharp correction, but still facing important structural hurdles. Price has reclaimed the $92,000 area, which places BTC back above a key horizontal level that previously acted as support during mid-2025. This recovery has eased immediate downside pressure and suggests buyers are defending the range rather than capitulating. However, the broader trend remains mixed. Bitcoin is still trading below the declining short-term moving average, which has capped upside attempts since the November breakdown. This indicates that, despite the bounce, momentum has not fully shifted back in favor of bulls. The recovery so far resembles consolidation after a drawdown rather than a confirmed trend reversal. From a structural perspective, the rising longer-term moving averages remain intact and well below the price. This signals that the macro uptrend from 2023 has not been invalidated. As long as BTC holds above the green moving average, the larger bullish structure remains technically preserved. That said, the distance between price and these longer-term supports has narrowed, reflecting reduced trend strength. Volume has remained relatively muted during the rebound, suggesting that buying interest is cautious rather than aggressive. For Bitcoin to reassert bullish control, it would need to reclaim and hold above the short-term moving average with expanding volume. Until then, price action points to a fragile recovery within a broader consolidation phase.
